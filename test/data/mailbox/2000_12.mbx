LPD has been my choice for paper developer since the '60s.  It disappeared 
for a while, but there's no problem finding it now.

It appeals to me because, as the name says, it lasts a long time (LPD = 
Lasting Paper Developer, as I recall).  The half-used jug in the darkroom 
never goes bad before I finish it and the tray lasts longer than I do.

As for specific dilutions, those times when I want to make just a few 
prints (or catch up on contact prints) a high dilution (1:6 water) works 
fine and doesn't use much stock solution.  Perhaps the contacts work so 
well because they are on RC paper, with incorporated developer of their 
own--might not have the same luck with fiber papers without "ID."  My 
"regular" dilution for FB papers is closer to 1:3 or 1:4.  The can says the 
tone changes with dilution, rather than the contrast, going warmer with 
more dilution, but I can't see much difference in the prints.

My limited experience with Selenium toning after developement in LPD has 
been good.

Packed in cans as it was originally, there's no danger that the bag will 
leak and spoil the powder.  (Don't you hate when your last package of 
developer turns up bad on Saturday night?)  And it doesn't need hot water 
to mix.  (I do use distilled to make stock.)

Congratulations and best wishes to Brandess-Kalt-Aetna (www.bkaphoto.com) 
who keep LPD, Acufine, the Heico line, and some other b/w photo chemicals 
on the market.

  Thank you so much again, as I have many times in the past.
  The fact that Citric is more effective than bisulfite is one of the
things I was curious about.
  Your observation about halation rings a bell. In highschool I used a
great deal of Geveart Artex but developed for long periods (around 8
minutes) as advised by a mentor of the time (he was wrong about other
things too). I could actually see the image spread after a time. Artex
seemed to worse in this aspect than other papers. However, I used what I
could get cheap which meant 19 cent a roll Gevapan 30 and Geveart paper. 
  I wonder if halation accounts for the use of UV printers for aerial film.
UV was used in the 1930's for sound recording to reduce irradiation in the
emulsions. Later emulsions were better and could be recorded with white
light. Photographic sound recording requires very high resolution and is
subject to all sorts of obscure problems which are of no consequence to
pictorial work.

The long toe is enhaced by active concentrated hydroquinone developers
(HC110 B or A), whose products accelerate development in well exposed
areas of the negative. Tri-X Pro (sheet) has similar characteristics, and
they are exaggerated in Ektapan, and more so in PCF, though I wouldn't
recommend that as a general purpose film.

Richard is aware of the problems which one can get into easily, but
I'll repeat my admonitions. I'd suggest that the film be given adequate
exposure (EI 125 with TXP) and then adjust developing time to give proper
tonal relationships for zone 5 vs zone 8 using the more or less straight
portion of the curve. Then using real world subjects, determine a speed
which gives best shadow rendition in prints printed for proper high
values. That way, underexposed negatives, depressed midtones, and blown
out high values are avoided.
If one is attracted "compensating development" or "forgiving negatives"
or "FB + fog = 0.1", think twice about what is going on here.

As often happens, I fell asleep at the keyboard when I wrote that reply
confusing Adrol with Adurol. I doubt that FP would have dredged up
Adurol, though it might suit the purpose better.

Hauff's Adurol is:

Water                     10 oz
Sodium Sulfite             4 oz
Potassium Carbonate        3 oz
Chlorohydroquinone       1.5 oz

I'd add some bromide, though one can very likely find better warm-tone
chloro- or bromohydroquinone formulations. The developer 
is diluted as "required" (1+5 for film) and times determined by
experimentation...  safe recommendations for 19th century developers.

Greetings-

Please forgive the cross-list posting....

I would love to find some of the *old* Fortezo Poly-WarmTone paper made by
Forte.  Polywarm was replaced a year or so ago with Poly Warmtone PLUS.

While I am more than satisfied with the new PLUS version, there is one
split-toning process which depended on the old paper exclusively.

Anyone out there sitting on a stash of the old paper who might like to
liquidate some it for a little extra Christmas cash????  I would offer to
pay something of a premium over your costs - depending on what size/how much
you've got.  I might even discuss paying 100% and offering a print into the
bargain as well.... Let's talk!

Thanks!

Jon Bailey

Thanks for all the feedback about these units. I'm gonna research the ones
that are available and make a decision about which one I'll buy in the next
couple of weeks. I'm certainly looking forward to enjoying my darkroom time
again.

Thanks Michael, Richard,  and others !!
 With the use of Amidol could you suggest a stop bath? I am a little
confused and wonder if acetic or citric acid would be better? Must have
missed a post somewhere....:o)
 Thanks again for the help understanding the properties of Amidol. I'll
probably stay with Smiths formula as it works great so far and might be
better left alone by a chemical mixing novice like me! :o)
 I might mention that a friend is using Smiths formula in a Jobo for
developing Azo contacts.....he pours from a stoppered bottle and claims at
least one week use from a working solution { one shot developing}.
  Slightly stained and continuing on,
      Chuck.

I have an Omega D5 variable condensor. The two fixed condensors had been
shipped while still installed in the housing. They bounced together slightly
causing a few small chips and scratches in the surface. I was aware of these
when I bought the enlarger but the price was very good so thought I would
have a go. The chips have not presented any problems until now when I am
trying to do some prints with very large areas of uniform tone. The chipped
areas show up as lighter areas on the final prints. I can work around it by
rotating the negative and other such manipulations, but would like to
consider a way of repair. 

Could anyone advise if polishing the surfaces is feasible. Would anyone
recommend any of the acrylic filler materials used to repair chipped
windshields or the like. Is there an alternative to replacing the condensor
lenses?

Thanks.

Quite frankly, Dave, with so much of this equipment gathering dust in
basements now, finding replacements or substitutes is a piece of
cake...for cheap.  Over the past couple of years, I've bought two complete
D enlargers - a 3 and a 4 - with Chromegas (which I'd recommend to you),
power supplies, Componon lenses, extra light sources (including complete
variable condensor heads) etc. in gorgeous condition for under $500!  I'm
serious, they're practically giving the stuff away since "everyone" is
going digital.  Keep searching and you will find.  Don't torment yourself
over the chipped glass...sniff some stuff out of some basement somewhere.
In the meantime, get a piece of frosted mylar from your local art supply
store and cut it to fit the bottom of the bottom condensor.  This will
give you diffused illumination - minus a couple of stops of light - and
probably more even illumination (but check it to make sure).

Curt

Brian,

I bought a second hand Jobo 3226 with two 4x5 reels (each can take six negs) for the bargain price of  GBP 15 ( approx USD 25 ). It works just like your normal paterson tank.
I can do all my processing in the daylight. It will fill and empty much faster than a combi tank. The only down side is that it will use more chemistry than necessary but I am prepared to live with that for the time being. It remains to be seen if even development is obtained.

 As far as BTZS tubes are concerned I think I am correct in saying that the book specifically says to turn the lights out when opening the tube to put the developer in. This means a truly dark room is required!
It also says you need a tempered water bath for development (tray 1). Also it says you need a stop bath (tray 2). Also it says take the film out of the tube and fix them (tray 3) . It then says to rinse them in a tray (tray 4). Then we have a hypo clear bath to use because the tubes stop the anti halation dye from being removed (tray 5). Then wash (tray 6).

How do you figure out that using tubes takes up less space when they require a six tray process as opposed to a the equivalent 4 tray process using trays only? Add to that the messing about with individual tubes and the need for constant agitation which incidentally removes the ability to use two bath or compensating  developers to full advantage, then I cannot see the benefit of using tubes.

Use the citric acid SB-8 formula, which is 15 g citric acid per liter,
and if possible, check it with a meter or test strips. Amidol is
activated at a pH of 4.0, so you want the pH of the stop to be less than
that. The first pKa for citric acid is 3.08 vs 4.65 for acetic acid -
it's a stronger acid. Although the citric acid concentration is less than
the typical acetic acid stop (50 ml of 28% / liter), it's capacity before
reaching pH 4.0 is around 3 to 4 X greater than the acetic acid stop.

Last spring I did a little testing with LPD.

I printed the same print with the following dillutions: 
   1:1   1:2   1:4   1:8

The problem I encountered was with the 1:8. It seemed very inconsistant
and was exhausted very fast. I stayed with 1:4 and things seemed fine. 

However, the few prints I did at 1:8 turned out a wonderful warm tone.

Dave,
Before changing your condenser lenses, try painting out the scratches /chips
with matt black paint.  I once did this to a friend's very badly chipped
slide projector condenser lens. It worked beautifully.

  I think you are going to have to replace the condensers. The glass of
which they are made seems particularly brittle so chips tend to be large.
Repolishing would be more expensive than new condensers. One can
occasionally find used condensers in good conditions. The glass itself is,
I believe, the same as used in D-2 condensers, maybe even the housing. 
  I think new ones are still available but are expensive. 
  You might try Harry Taylor who specializes in old enlargers. 
  Great care must be excercized when cleaning these guys due to the
brittleness, the hard part being getting them back in the housing without
chipping them.

  Citric acid stop baths are not compatible with hardening fixing baths. I
am not sure if the problem is only that the Citric acid interferes with
hardening (not really a big problem) or whether it eventually causes some
sludging of the fixer (which could be a problem) so its best to use a
non-hardening fixer with it. 
  Ilford's fixing baths are all non-hardening as is Kodak Rapid Liquid
Fixer if the leave the hardener out.
  Ilford packaged stop bath is a Citric acid type. 
  Citric has the advantage of not having the sharp vinegar odor of Acetic
acid.

Barry, that's just the kind of thing I hoped to find basic reading materials
on.  I'm sure I can put something opaque there so the paper sees much less
light, perhaps nearly none, but it sure appears to me to be a different problem
than working with the projected image.  And how do I know where I am when I've
got the negative mostly covered with a burning card? (Now there's a straight
line just begging for a punch line.)  I assume I need to sort of restrict the
light source and not illuminate the walls, to prevent excess light bleed around
the edges of dodging/burning tools.  Or is that part of the solution instead of
the problem, does light bleed substitute for height to soften the edges of the
shadow?  Common sense tells me to apply my experience with the enlarger to the
new task at hand, and I will for as long as it takes, but why are there no
written suggestions for beginners?  Does everybody have to reinvent the wheel
when they take up the larger formats and contact printing?  I'm still putting
the camera back together, then I'll start with one paper and learn the rudiments
of mechanically manipulating the light before I try to imagine that I can
benefit from other papers.

Dick Gifford, Adair, OK

I think the death of the hardener has been exaggerated in the 
literature you've read.

The carboxyl groups of citrate will compete for alum with those of 
gelatin, which may reduce the degree of hardening in some instances. 
This was noticed when citric acid was substituted for acetic or 
boric acids to acidfy hardening fixers.

However, one needs a large concentration of citric acid to see the 
reduction. In 1938, Richard B. Willcock published a paper titled 
"Preventing Precipitation in the Acetic Acid - Alum - Sulfite
Hardening Bath" (Br. J. Phot., 85:419 (1938). To prevent the
precipitation of basic salts he advocated the use of a hardening
stop bath with the following composition.

Water                      236 ml
Sodium Sulfite            22.7 g
Glacial Acetic Acid       17.0 ml
Sodium Citrate             5.7 g
Potassium Alum            22.7 g

The pH is around 4 due to the addition of acetic acid, or it 
wouldn't work as a hardener. The alum and citrate concnetrations
are fairly high, and they don't cause preciption or sludge formation,
citrate actually prevents that from happening. Although the citrate 
level is approximately 1/4th that of alum by weight. One would have to
carry over _a lot_ of the 15 g/l citric acid stop to get into the 
region where citrate carrover is 25% of the alum level by weight, and
then, it would do little to impede hardening, but would prevent the
precipitation of aluminum sulfite or aluminum hydroxide.

If a second bath of hardening fixer is used for archival processing,
there won't be any loss of hardening at all.

Right, Brian, all things are relative.  I think everybody should take up auto
racing for a while, it gives you a whole new perspective.  I can run my
photography hobby any way I want to on less money than fell thru the cracks of
our racing operation.  To me, photography seems to be almost free.  More in
keeping with the trend of this thread, time is not free.  I don't understand how
y'all can speak so casually about only damaging an occasional negative by
bunching them in a tray.  Each one of these 8x10 prizes I have sucked off the
landscape will get individual attention in the tray.  A few minutes invested in
such care will protect the time invested in gathering the masterpiece in the
first place.  And specific to the question, I do my 4x5's in a Nikkor tank,
which I haven't seen anybody mention yet.  Great tank, holds 12, capped for
inversion, simple, safe, effective, just a little slow on the fill/drain.  I'm
going to keep using the neg holder and dip & dunk in separate containers in the
dark, I think, because it just sounds better to get the developer in/out
quicker, although I haven't seen a problem.

You might try using Kodak Azo paper for contact prints. It is VERY slow
compared to most enlarging papers. Slow enough that I use a 150 watt flood
light about 3 feet above the contact printing frame and regularly have
exposures around 45 seconds. This gives me time to look at the negative in
the frame and dodge as needed and to plan any burning. I just lay a larger
piece of opaque matboard over the contact printing frame to keep the light
off. Then I lay a piece of mat board with a cutout about the size I need to
work with for burning different shapes on that, remove the solid board under
it and burn as needed.

Plan on a Utah photo trip in August 2002. Brigham City Museum Gallery will
host a photographic show, The Great American West: The B&W Landscape.
It features the images of Dick Arentz, Paula Chamlee Tillman Crane, Chip
Hooper, Craig Law, Ray McSavaney, Barry Parsons, John Sexton, Dan Smith and
Michael A. Smith.
This a show you don't want to miss and a perfect time to visit Utah on your
vacation. Brigham City is in Northern Utah, about an hour North of Salt Lake
City, home of the Bear River
Migratory Bird Refuge and on the way to Yellowstone National Park.
If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me for information as
I am the curator of the show.

If you are worried about reflected light, I'd suggest using an
enlarger as the source, or placing a small bulb in a cone reflector,
and covering most of the bulb with aluminum foil. If a 1/2" 
diameter portion of the bulb were uncovered, placing the card 
halfway between the negative and lamp would give a 1/2" feathering
of the light on the negative, As the distance to the negative is 
decreased, the width of the feathered edge decreases proportionately.

One of the simplest ways to "see" what is goin on, is simply to place
a proof print next to the frame as a guide. If you are using an amber 
safelight for VC paper, place a couple of sheets of red acetate over it,
and you won't have any fogging problems, and you will be able to see 
the print.

Another "refinement" is to cut sheets of light yellow or red acetate
to size, and place them on a sheet of glass resting on the frame to 
give a bit of spacing. The sheets may be stacked for gradation, and 
should be well out of focus.

Another approach is to build a rack to hold a sheet of glass a few 
inches over the frame. The relative positions of the rack and frame 
must be fixed. Place the developed proof print in the frame, and turn
on the lamp. Mark the glass with a thin light blue marker watching 
the shadow on the print, and then place your masks on the glass, or
use cutout tools at that level. The thin blue lines should not 
interfere with exposure.

For fine control, one can use a clear sheet of acetate as a mask 
(I prefer fixed out lith film), and "paint" areas with different 
dilutions of a light red dye to hold back very small areas. 
Alternatively, one can use the retouching base of the film, but
mistakes are harder to correct. Use a light touch, and test squares
for different areas.

Some people use an unsharp mask, and do their "retouching" on it by 
adding dyes and using an abrasive reducer. If it is destroyed, the
process can be repeated.

Fine burning in can be done with a penlight masked with a short 
tube, and exposures refined by practice and testing. You might want
to print a step tablet, and then do different burning exposures across
it to determine the effect.

Or one can just scan the negative, run it through Photoshop, and
print one which has all the corrections. See the alt-process list
archives for details.

Thanks, Dan, will probably start with Azo since I understand from all concerned
that I will probably end up there anyway.  Paper is not the hard question,
though.  I think I can find where to dodge about as well as under the enlarger,
just not as bright.  Specifics of burning not clear.  I have a negative, I'm
looking at the back side, I have a sheet of glass over it.  I have no problem
with edge burn or horizon line, large shapes especially of greatly different
tones, etc.  I can tell where I am.  Then I put a sheet of matboard over it and
I can't see the negative.  Now I position a movable card with a suitable hole in
it without seeing the image.  I slide the lower card away and somehow am
supposed to position the hole over the desired area of a negative I can't see.
Large areas I could imagine finding soon enough, small areas I see myself
burning a wandering trail while I try to figure out where the detail is I want
to work on, if I'm able to find it at all, especially if it's in an area of
similar tones.  How do y'all find where you are?  You mention planning your
burning during the basic exposure, where I would normally expect you to have it
planned in advance, at least in terms of where and how much.  Does this mean
imprinting the look of the thing in your brain under working conditions so it's
easier to find a desired spot?  Still, if I want to burn near a dodged area like
I did with this print on my wall, where the tones were very similar on the
negative, I need some kind of locating scheme.  I'm imagining mechanical
contraptions and hoping there's a better way.  I often cut specific
dodging/burning tools for each negative with the enlarger, and I expect to do
that as needed, but I sure don't want to build a specific robot for each of
several burns.

Hey, thanks, Michael.  You should write the book.  These are specific
suggestions that give me a much clearer picture of the process.  I can see a
lot of this working for sure, and all of it making enough sense for me try
it (well, maybe except the digital part).  At last, a bag of tricks.  I know
this must sound pretty basic to the experienced contact printers, but I'm
one old man that was at a loss as to how to find that crazy negative under
there.

Gratefully,

Dick Gifford. Adair, OK

To this I would add that, if not rinsed off, wetting agent can also build up
with a slight stickiness. A rinse in a little stop bath followed by fresh

steel ball bearings in the ratchet mechanism. Later ones don't. These are
actually the cause of sticking film loads - the ratchet sticks in the
'locked' position (note - trimming the corners off leading film edges does
NOT deal with the problem for this reason). Often a sharp tap of the side of
the reel against the worktop will free this as a temporary measure in the
dark. Later, in the light, a bleach clean as you describe, followed by a
thorough dry, then poking round the ratchet balls with a soft pencil to
leave it coated with graphite fixes the sticky ratchet.
I have bought some Hewes stainless steel spirals to fit Paterson tanks. That
for 35mm is fine, but I have had some bad kink marks on 120 Verichrome Pan
when loading medium format even when taking extreme care. I prefer to use
the Paterson reels with the clean regime you mention.

Hi Malcolm
I would definitely recommend NOT loading paper end first. This does tend to
cause jams. Also, it is wise not to completely unwind the film and remove it
from the backing paper. This isn't because it makes it easier or otherwise
to load - but purely because, if it does stick in the reel ratchet, instead
of struggling away in the dark, you can quietly rewind the film on to its
spool and take a breather. Often the ratchet ball can be freed up with a
finger nail, and the second loading attempt goes without a hitch. But if it
doesn't, simply rewind the film and switch to another reel.
For some peculiar reason, I always find that if I come back to the sticking
reel with another film later, it works fine. In the UK we call that Sod's
Law. I don't what the US term would be.
Incidentally, I am sure you already know, but in case you don't, you can
load two 120 films on a Paterson reel one after the other. Just make sure
the first is wound to the centre of the reel using your fingers when the end
goes past the ratchet. Just ensure the paper tape is left on the end of the
first film. Otherwise the beginning of the second film rides over the top of
the end of the first film.
You can't do this with stainless reels of course. It can save considerable
time and chemicals sometimes.

Hi

Thanks to all the kind advice received.  However one of the reels is
virtually new and they are always drier than dry but I will try some
some chlorine bleach and a little liquid detergent.  I have been doing
exactly as you mentioned George and removing the film from the paper
backing first, then loading it in the tank with the folded tape first.
Ken's sugestion of loading under water sounds an idea but could be too
much fun in the changing bag that we use ;-)

Maybe I'll try another film tonight but with 45 degree corners cut on
the leading edge like I do for 35mm.

I would echo the comments of Richard Ross, as any humidity/moisture/sweat
can be a disaster with this loading process.

A few extra comments/hints to the recent thread:-
** Make sure the bearings are clean and in good condition.
** I never take the paper off the films before loading; that's just an extra
procedure and extra risk. Instead, I engage the end of the paper on to a
spool taken from a 120 film and wind the paper on to that, to keep it out of
the way. If the worst happens then this process is reversible; you can
easily rewind the film and paper.
** When it comes to engaging the film on the Paterson reel, then I tend to
engage one bearing to start with and turn the reel to "walk" the film on to
it past the second bearing.

With best regards,

Ian Watkins

Didn't the person who posted the original inquiry say that his reels were
new? If so, what would these various dismantlings, washes, rinses, soaks in
stop bath, chlorine, etc. accomplish?

Richard - If you try contact printing and Azo paper (and, to a lesser
extent, any other paper) I think you'll find that you won't need to dodge
and burn nearly as much as most of us typically do with enlargements on
enlarging paper.  I rarely find it necessary to dodge or burn to any
significant extent when contact printing using Azo.

However, not everyone who contact prints ends up using Azo. I like it and
believe that its advantages outweigh the disadvantages. There are, however,
some disadvantages: (1) limited contrast control (basically two grades only,
with some ability to use a water bath to get a grade 1 1/2 or 2 1/2 but
still nothing like you're used to with VC enlarging paper; (2) single weight
paper is delicate and not as easy to handle without wrinkling as enlarging
paper; and (3) expensive with limited supply sources.

In my experience the developer that is used with Azo has a significant
effect on the light source you use. I've found that with ordinary paper
developer (Dektol and Ilford Universal) it's very feasible to use my
enlarger as a light source. The times generally run between 30 seconds and
60 seconds. With Amidol as the developer (which is my preferred developer
when using Azo), the times under the enlarger become much longer and
impractical for me so then I use a 75 watt floodlight about two feet abolve
the paper. When I tried this flood light source and developed in a "normal"
developer (i.e. non-Amidol), even five  seconds of exposure resulted in a
solid black print.

The ability to use your enlarger with some developers means you can use VC
enlarging paper and gain the contrast control you're used to if you find
that the limited contrast control with Azo is a problem in general or with a
particular print. The thing I didn't like about using normal  developers
with Azo was that the two I tried  produced a distinct bluish tone to the
prints that I didn't like at all. The blue could be eliminated with toning
in selenium but the selenium produced a warm tone which I didn't care for
either. The tone produced by Amidol looks just right to me and I tone in
selenium only for permanence when using it..

I should add that my enlarger light source is an Aristo VCL 4500. I don't
think it's particularly bright (in fact it seems dimmer than the condenser
head I've seen) but possibly dimmer enlarger light sources wouldn't work
with Azo even using normal developers.

Good luck. I think you'll really enjoy contact printing. I suspect the
reason you don't see a lot of books and articles about it is that it really
is very simple once you experiment a little and find the materials that suit
you.

A friend called me yesterday and said that he found a reference to Ardol in
the Photo Lab Index, apparently it was a warm toned developer manufactured
by GAF.

I wonder if this might be Gevaert warm toned  developer listed in Anchel's
"The Variable Contrast Printing Manual"? Just curious.

Thanks for your help,

  Kodak currently recommends very pure Isopropanol (Isopropyl alcohol) for
film cleaning. It is also useful for other purposes as a degreaser to
replace 1,1,1,Trichloroethane. 
  I recently found that Fry's, the computer superstores, carry 99.9 pure
Isopropanol among the cleaning agents it stocks. I bought a one liter
bottle for $7.95 US. I think Fry's may be nationwide but certainly there
are other stores for computer nuts and they are likely to have the same
thing. This particular brand is made by MG Chemicals in Canada. 
  It is important for film cleaning that the solvent be as near water free
as possible to reduce the chance of emulsion swelling and damage,
especially for old film where the emulsion may be soft or even partially
water soluble. 
  I have not been able to find Isopropyl purer than 95% at the drug store.
Kodak specifies at least 98%.
  I hope this is useful.
  BTW, Kodak has a perfectly enormous amount of literature on its web site.

Strange we want to burn in small areas, and with contact prints you set the
time for the burn-in, given that's all the manipulation you want on this
picture ... and doge back the large areas as you can more easily see.

  As I posted before its was probably Ansco/Agfa 135, a formula similar to
Kodak D-52 (Selectol). The descriptions of 125 and Ardol in the Ansco paper
handbook are identical.
  For those interested in such stuff here is a comparison of the two formulas:

					Ansco 135		Kodak D-52
Water (at 125F /50C)		750.0 ml		500.0 ml
Metol (Elon)			  1.6 grams		  1.5 grams
Sodium Sulfte, dessicated	 24.0 grams		 22.5 grams
Hydroquinone			  6.6 grams		  6.0 grams
Sodium Carbonate, 
 monohydrated			 24.0 grams		 17.0 grams
Potassium Bromide			  2.8 grams		  1.5 grams
Water to make			  1.0 liter		  1.0 liter

Both are diluted 1:1 for use. Both formulas state that additional bromide
can be added for warmer tones, Ansco states that up to double the amount of
KBr in the formula can be added.

  There are many other formulas from various manufacturers which are
essentially identical to  each other. The two above are nearly identical,
the Ansco formula being slightly more active due to more carbonate, but
being more restrained due to the fairly large amount of bromide. So, it
probably produces slightly higher contrast than the Kodak formula.

Richard,
You mean you're cleaning the emulsion side with Isopropanol?
If swelling is a problem, why not re-wash the film after the cleaning. That 
should give an even 'swelling' and drying... maybe.

  Yes, _maybe_. Old emulsion may dissolve or come off the base when
re-washed. Color film will have the stabilizer leached out. Rewashing film
is not a good idea for simple cleaning. 
 In the past the recommended emulsion side cleaners were Carbon
Tetrachloride, 1,1,1,Trichlorethane, and now pure Isoprapanol. Carbon tet
is _very_ hazardous, it can cause liver damage on chronic exposure and is a
carcinogen. It is absorbed through the skin. 1,1,1,Trichloroethane is an
envrionmental hazard and a possible carcinogen, it was supposed to be less
hazardous than Carbon tet.
  Currently Kodak recommends dry Isopropanol. It is an effective enough
degreaser and is safe for the emulsion if very pure. It is relatively
non-hazardous (same main ingredient as rubbing alcohol, which is 70%) but
it does burn and the fumes are not good for you so it should be used with
adequate ventilation. Since it is readily available and quite cheap (if not
bought as a reagent grade chemical, it doesn't need to be _that_ pure) it
is a good choice.

Printofine was a commercial print developer that I used extensively 
during my first incarnation as a photographer in the late 60's. I 
remember that I liked it better than Dektol, but I don't really 
remember why at this point.

GAF (General Aniline and Film) became the caretaker of what

I haven't looked at the book, so you might want to post the formula.

Gevaert had at least two warm tone developers:  G-262, which used
hydroquinone, ans G-261 which relied on glycin and hydroquinone.
Both of those agents inherently give fine grain, which results in
the warm tones. Usually, dilution, bromide addition and short
development times enhance the effect. However, these developers
only give warm effects with fine grain chlorobromide emulsions, and 
don't do much for bromide papers.

Other warm tone developers used low levels of metol compared
to hydroquinone, and tossed in bromide for good measure.
For cold tones, more metol is used, which gives larger grain at
very alkaline pHs (like Rodinal). For less contrast, most  or all
of the hydroquinone is left out, and less carbonate is used.

Thanks a lot, Brian.  Yes, I'm expecting it to eventually be simple, it just
seemed unnecessary to start from total ignorance.  Most helpful to have some
pros and cons regarding papers and developers, also some reasonable ranges and
tendencies to expect.  Very encouraging about less dodging/ burning (after
tailoring my negs for contacts, of course).  Your input very much appreciated.

Hello again, I should look below the horizon here to see if there's more.
Maybe the image I referred to is unusual, but I understand a lot of printers
wind up with complex dodge/burn routines now and then.  This is the skull of a
hardhead catfish.  The underside is a nice crucifix.  It's all bone, of course,
all the same shade of off-white, and there was only so much I could do with
lighting on a 3" skull.  Thus the manipulation to keep a little glow on the
figure on the cross while subduing the rest.  Without digging out my notes I'm
guessing a dozen operations.  I see the point you're making about extending the
base exposure and dodging all but the small area.  Certainly sounds easier to
find on a contact.  Probably not a bad idea w/ the enlarger sometimes too,
although I like exposing for the critical light tone for consistency , then
manipulating areas of less importance.  The best news so far is to expect less
manipulation with contacts.

I appreciate your interest and advice.  Adair, Oklahoma is second only to
Carmel as a haven for B&W photographers.  Well, maybe a little further down the
list.  Nobody here would understand why I shoot B&W anyway.  Tulsa, the nearest
metropolitan area, has limited resources.  Sort of a cultural backwater in
terms of serious photography.  So I read a lot.  This group was a lucky find.

Best personal regards,
Dick Gifford, Adair, OK

Dick
I am surprised nobody else has mentioned the most practical way to dodge and
burn LF contact prints to avoid all the hassle you mention. I thought it was
the norm. Here's what I do.
I make a straight print to assess burning and dodging requirements, and I
may make 'test strips' in specific areas of the image to check the amount of
less exposure needed in dodged sections. Note that I plan to give the print
enough exposure to print the most burned area with correct exposure. Other
areas are dodged back by varying amounts to achieve the tonal balance I
want. i.e. there is no print burning, only dodging.
I then put the negative on a light box and lay over the top a sheet of clear
fixed out film, or I use clear acetate sheet from a graphic arts shop. Then
on top of this clear sheet, I make a 'contour map' of translucent or
transparent films of various kinds laid over the areas which need holding
back.
You can use plain fixed out film,  and I also use all sorts of tacky film
material. Graphic arts shops sell rolls of this in various colours and
neutral, and, for small areas, Scotch magic tape is fine. Clear fixed out
film gives about 1/3 stop holding back. You simply overlay enough layers to
achieve the dodging that you want in each area. I cut the successive layers
slightly smaller than the one below to give the 'contoured' effect so that
the edges of dodging are 'feathered'.
The final contact print is made with the contour dodging map over the
negative. It needs to be spaced away from the negative of course to prevent
hard edges to the dodging. I use a thick sheet of plate glass laid on top of
the negative; sometimes two sheets of glass.
It is quick and simple to do, and you can get very tight precision for small
areas, and the dodging is exactly repeatable for all subsequent prints when
you have the tonal balance you want. The contour map overlay is simply filed
with the negative.
Obviously you have the extra hassle of ensuring clean glass surfaces for the
extra glass, and a new print over all exposure time will need to be assessed
to allow for the extra density of the overlay film above the negative.
You can get clever too. Instead of using neutral coloured film you can use
variations of magenta and yellow overlay with VC paper to manipulate
contrast too. You can also draw lines on the overlay with an ultra-soft
pencil to hold back really precise areas such as window frames, and the same
pencil can be used in wider areas to shade in, then smooth out gently with a
finger
In my ignorance, I thought all contact printers did this - I didn't realise
people were trying to wave dodgers above a virtually invisible image on the
negative. The contour map isn't my personal idea. It is how I was shown
contact printing more years ago than I care to remember. As I wrote in
'Elements' the same technique can be used above the negative in projection
printing when there is particularly tricky dodging, or when many identical
copies are needed of prints from the same negative and speed of production
is important. I smile sometimes when I hear of printers who are doing such
long runs - as samples for paper manufacturers for instance - using
programmable timers and performing the same stop/start multiple hand waving
sequence above a print hundreds and hundreds of times. With a contour map
overlay, and a high power enlarger light source, which can include
electronic flash, the print runs can be cut to a fraction of the time with a
single short exposure for each print.
Obviously, with the smaller sizes involved  above the negative carrier, it
becomes more tricky and fiddly to make contour map overlays, but for contact
prints from LF, it's just so easy.
Hope all that helps Dick.

Joe,

Sorry about the misleading info... the message was meant to be a private.
However, the author is Barry Thornton who is very active on this list. He
will no doubt respond to you as to when the book will be generally
available... I received a review copy from the publishers a few days ago...
and will read it again at the weekend. I think most folks will enjoy it...
it's not a "potentially dull" standard reference work, more of an "insight"
to the photographer and his methods of working... and he makes damn fine
prints.

Found more info for you...

"Edge of Darkness" ISBN 1 902538 09 9
The publisher's web site is www.aurumpress.co.uk

Regards,

Ed Buziak / Publisher
Camera & Darkroom magazine

Ed
Thanks for your most kind comments. The book is available now. It is
available direct from me via the secure shop on my web site. This will be
undiscounted but a signed, and if you wish, dedicated copy. You can buy it
discounted from Amazon, but amazon.co.uk, not .com
Bookshops in the UK will have it, but take care about delivery promises -
especially from mail order outlets - it is in short supply. It is to be
supplied via bookshops in USA, but I don't know when they will arrive there.
I am only the author, not the publisher!
May I just emphasise that last point. After months of promises about
publication date and delivery to me from the publisher, other than a dozen
review copies flown over from the Singapore production plant at the end of
October, despite my constantly harassing the publisher, the very first
copies available in this country finally arrived with me on 26th November. I
had been told, and relayed to customers, 20th November.
My wife and I have worked all last weekend, and all through the first days
of last week. literally to the early hours of the morning, to sign,
dedicate, pack, process payment, address, record, and deliver direct to the
mail distribution centre all the books on order in a strictly first ordered,
first despatched sequence. No cheques or credit card transactions were
processed until despatch had taken place. By Wednesday, all orders had been
despatched, and we are now working on a same-day-as-ordered-despatch
routine.
Why do I mention this? It is possible we have some lurkers who are among the
one or two people who have sent me pretty unpleasant emails as if I were the
publisher. I guess most people would be aware that I am keener than anybody
to see the book out.

I meant abrasion of one type or another. The favourite is the corner of one
sheet of film across the emulsion of another, but any kind of sliding of the
emulsion of a sheet of film against another surface.

Brian,
I missed that. Should read more carefully. You are right, he shouldn't have
trouble with new reels.
Incidentally, I picked up a new tip on this (for used reels) only yesterday,
and it seems to work well. The tip is to use some household silicone polish,
such as 'Mr. Sheen' in the UK, and apply it to the inside of the spiral
slots with a small point formed from folded kitchen towel. The correspondent
who mentioned it said there was no effect on subsequent processing
chemicals. I have tried it with film, but not with processing yet, and the
film does positively glide into the reel. I'll have to test out the
non-interference with processing chemicals.
Incidentally I find this type of polish a positive boon in the darkroom.
Applied carefully to enlarger columns, focussing rails, masking easel
sliding components etc., it causes ultra smooth movements without any oily
residue to foul fingers, film or paper.

Having just started with 4x5 I have read that not all Film Backs / Holders conform to the same standard of depth so 
I measured the depth of my Film Back and film holders(with film). I  find that there is some variation. However the variation is betwen 0.2mm and almost nil depending on where I take the measurements. I am wondering how significant this difference is and if it is too much then what is the considered acceptable margin of error. I think it unlikely that any given film holder will be 100% accurate / level  and different films will be different thicknesses. 

Any advice / comments would be gratefully received.

TIA ,

Rob Champagne

Hi Barry - Thanks, that sounds interesting. I'm not much of a "house
husband" so I'm not very familiar with these kinds of products but I do get
to the grocery store occasionally. I don't think Mr. Sheen is sold in the
U.S. Does anyone on the list know for sure and, if not, whether there is a
similar product sold here?

Barry, now you see what prompted this question.  I couldn't find the norm.
Everybody knows how and everybody assumes everybody else knows how.  I started
with 4x5 and learned everything I know from reading (and trying), and there's a
wealth of info out there, the knowledge of the ages, on  printing with an

This is far harder to write about than do so I apologize for my poor and
lengthy explanation.
A note here on my favorite way to control things. I find it much harder to
properly dodge as compared to burning in when doing contacts . { too small
of areas to dodge sometimes} The easier way to control things comes from a
tool that is easy to construct. It is a burn - in tool that uses a piece of
Rubylith or other Red or "light-safe" transparent material that can be seen
through while printing in.. Rubylith is a common GraphicArts  material
 inexpensive} that can be found in any graphic arts business or supply
store. I believe that Barry or someone on the list actually makes safelights
with fluorescent lights by using a couple of layers to cover them. I have
used a short 24inch tube for thirty years for my safelight and it is still
working great! I found a large piece for 2 dollars. What this allows is for
you to look at what you are doing instead of having a solid card in you line
of sight. The design is one of a large enough sheet to easily cover the
contact print with a large hole in the middle. The hole in the middle is
covered with another piece of ruby lith transparent { but light safe }
material with various sizes or shapes cut into it and only the preferred
opening used.
 This is the method that is taught by Michael Smith and I adopted it to my
methods with great ease and far more accurate results than before.
 You can easily see what you are doing and clearly see the white light
coming through the opening . The tool works very well as it can be adapted
to use many shaped openings just by switching the small section in the
middle. I have a "pop" rivet slightly offset near the middle that allows me
to turn a circle of material that has many different openings in it until I
get the opening I like for each shape I want to burn in.
 I'll try again in a hopefully more simple way. I have a 16x20 inch
cardboard frame with an 11x14 inch rubylith plastic window taped in the
center. This has a small opening in the center that has a wheel attached to
it that has several sized and shaped openings in it - this is rotated over
the opening cut into the Rubylith "window" to get the shape of the burning
in light to be just what I like.
 The large window of rubylith gives me the ability to leave the light on at
all times and watch what I am doing with ease. I can actually hold my finger
over the small central window and look around at the contact frame and get
the exact spot I want to work on right under my chosen shape "aperture".
 Dang! I wish you could see how easy this makes it as opposed to the problem
I have writing about it.
 A couple of other techniques I use are to establish a base time for the
print. The dodging that might be done is done while the base exposure is
being made. This will give a print that has only the burning left to do.
Then I use the above tool for the burning in.

Dick,

If you want to learn more about the technique of contact printing you may
wish to seek out the following book.
"Darkroom2", published by Lustrum Press in 1978. There is a section by Emmet
Gowin in which he discusses his technique for contacting printing & his use
of a contour map. There are photos of his maps & the effect it has on his
prints. There is also another Chapter in which Cole Weston describes his
technique in printing his fathers negatives. I believe that the book is now
out of print, but if you do a search on www.abebook.com you will find that
there are several second-hand copies available.

You may also like to read the following articles which have appeared in
magazines.  "Dye Dodging" by David Kachel, which appeared in the May/June
1993 edition of "Darkroom & Creative Camera Techniques" & "Selective
Masking" by Alan Ross, which appeared in the July/Aug & Sept/Oct 1999
editions of "View Camera " magazine.

I have recently learnt that Bergger are to introduce a new paper called
"Prestige Contact 2", which has a Baryta Base like their NB ART paper, but
the emulsion is slower, making it suitable for contact printing. I have been
told by the Bergger distributor here in the UK that they are due to receive
a shipment in January & that it will be available in sizes from 10x8 to
20x24.

I hope all of this helps

Andy Forrester

Hello all !
I'm wondering how much chemical is needed to properly develop a film.
If somebody use Rodinal 1+50, it takes about 5 cc of chemical to
properly process a 135/36 film in a Paterson tank.
Some have reported dilution up to 1+200 to work !
What is the least amount of chemical you've used with success ?
I'll be curious to ear about that !

    Recently I decided to try rotary processing for B&W film developing. =
I already had a Jobo processor, which I have used for years (with =
complete satisfaction) to process color prints. So it was natural for me =
to start with Jobo recommendations, and that includes a five minute =
prewet. This was my first encounter with prewets in film processing, and =
so far, I don't like what I am seeing.
    I tried a couple of film/developer combinations, and got very =
confusing results. I could not get low contrast, and when I tried, I got =
very confusing characteristic curve shapes. Then I tried Agfa APX =
100/POTA, and it was more of the same. I decided I had to dig in and =
find out what was happening. Here is what I discovered.
    The five-minute prewet seriously distorts the shape of the =
characteristic curve. It causes spurious increases in the higher values =
of density, so that the overall contrast is increased, and the =
characteristic curve looks seriously ill. The curves with and without =
prewet are shown on one of my websites www.vsta.com/~alrob/prewet.html.=20
    I have no idea what physical and/or chemical effects is causing =
this, and maybe I don't need to know, since there is an easy way to get =

prewet, I don't see how the prewet recommendation has survived all these =
years.
    Jobo does say that the prewet is "controversial". They also say that =
it should not be used with Xtol developer, though it is not clear to me =
on what that is based. What has been your experience on this point? Are =
there other combinations which are bad? For what combinations is the =
prewet definitely OK? I would appreciate any information which could =
prevent me from chasing unnecessary wild geese. Thanks in advance.

I shoot 57 b/w 400 exclusively and am beginning to move indoors with 
portraits. Has anyone concocted an inexpensive lighting setup with repeated 
success? I can't afford to run out and buy soft boxes and all that. There has 
to be an alternative to skylights, freezing or 2 second exposures and neck 
clamps.

> five minute prewet

  Jobo's intent with the five-minute prewet is that you can use your
standard predetermined or manufacturer-recommended development time for
intermittent agitation in the Jobo rotary system; whether and how well that
works in real-life usage is a matter of argument, as you've discovered.

  In my fiddling around, I found that when using rotary agitation of
rollfilm a brief prewet...one minute only...was needed in order to avoid
airbells, and that it had no significant effect on curve shape, CI
etc...even with Xtol. I never tried it with POTA, just ordinary developers.
I never use a prewet with sheetfilm.

 Phil Davis tested a variety of films using a standard developer and
varying prewet times; he found that a one-minute prewet caused no
significant changes, while several minutes or more caused a variety of EI
and CI changes depending on the film. There was _no_ consistent factor.

  Ilford recommends against a prewet, stating that their films have a
wetting agent incorporated into the emulsion and that a prewet can cause
mottling etc.

Or you can put eight fluorescent tubes on a chipboard, that will give 
you an exposure of about 1/30 at 5,6 with 400 film depending on how 
close you put the lights to the model. You models will prefer this 
this light to the halogen worklight (see below) which has other 
advantages like less volume and less weight and you can pug in and 
play at once. Mounting the tubes on the chipboard and wiring them 
takes about an hour. The tubes are about $5 each at hardware stores, 
which makes weight more of an issue than the cost. Long tubes for 
full length pictures and short tubes for portraits. Add a simple 
halogen spot for the hair and/or the background. And the white 
cardboard as below. See some b+w portraits I made with this setup at 
www.almqvist.net/chris

That makes 6 ml (Rodinal I presume) per film if you put one film in 
the 2 reel tank and it is a Paterson tank. I have been told by an 
(otherwise) knowledgable people that one ml per film would be 
sufficient, but when I tested it with 2ml I got very unsatisfactory 
results. I have not tried with 3 or 4 or 5 ml per film, but I 
regularly use 6ml per Delta 100, that is 1+50 in a  300 ml tank. With 
HP5+ I feel I need 1+25 or 12 ml per film. My 2ml test, btw, was with 
APX 25.

This really is a strange result. The usual effect of a prewet in 'normal'
spiral tank development is just the opposite. Time for time, it yields
SLIGHTLY less density in the highlights - effectively because the water in
the emulsion pre developing has to diffuse out to be replaced with the
developing solution. This takes slightly longer than the absorption of
developer by a 'dry', un-prewet, film emulsion.
As a matter of interest, Ilford specifically advise against prewetting. This
is not because it does any harm per se, but because they include in the film
coating a substance to promote the even absorption of the developer - sounds
like a wetting agent to me.
It may be that all film makers do this, but we don't know. I advise
pre-soaking with water at the correct development temperature with DiXactol
developer because all tanning and staining developers are very sensitive to
uneven development. In tests with just about every different make of film
under the sun, I never found one that gave uneven results or peculiar curve
shapes with pre-soaking. I have used DiXactol with Ilford films without
pre-soak without trouble, but needed to reduce an 8 minute time to 73/4 to
balance density if I was being super critical.
The other main reason, in fact THE main reason, I advise pre-soak is as a
tempering bath before pouring in the developer. In fact, if the air
temperature is greatly different from development temperature, I might give
two or three changes of presoak water at, say, one minute intervals with
plastic tanks.

I shoot 57 b/w 400 exclusively and am beginning to move indoors with
portraits. Has anyone concocted an inexpensive lighting setup with repeated
success? I can't afford to run out and buy soft boxes and all that. There
has
to be an alternative to skylights, freezing or 2 second exposures and neck
clamps.

Suggest you look at some of William Mortensen's books from the 1930s on very
simple and effective lighting techniques using tungsten lighting. You may be
amused by his taste in pose, sets and titling, and by his dogmatic views,
but the basic technique holds good and is very well explained. I last month
used his basic setup with one 500 watt light in a 10 inch reflector just
touching the top of the lens hood of a 150mm lens on my Rollei SL66 for a
head and shoulders portrait. There was a black back drop, but it didn't have
to be (no shadows on the background you see). Using the right exposure and
development technique as outlined by Mortensen, I got some beautiful results
that were a cinch to print, and which pleased the pernickety sitter - my
teenage son. Shutter speeds were 1/15 second at f11 with EI 100 film. The
basic Mortensen set-ups are flexible too. The sitter can move a little
without lights having to be constantly reset.
Here in the UK the Mortensen books occur regularly in various camera fairs,
and in used and antiquarian book shops.

Hello !
Planning to go mixing my own film and paper developpers, I wonder about which
chemicals to buy, and in what amount.
If I'm quite sure I will go for acetic acid for stop bath, I wonder for film and
paper dev, or fix.
Also, which formulas would you recomend for such a use ?

Remember, the nature of tungstonlight on Black & White film makes for the
need to pro-rate the film minus one stop.  Actually, rated speeds of film ar
more accurate 'off the box' in studio situations.

IE TriX rated 320 or 400 when exposed at exactly what the meter reads off a
gray card, zone 5, or off skin tones zone 6 will render exactly what you're
after.

I use those metal clamp lights and regular frosted bulbs at however bright I
want the illumination and it works right on.

I expose Forte 400 rated at 400under studio lights, and rateit at 200
outside.  Just like the instructions say; and I devleop with any of my
developers according to theresults I want at the instructions for TriX and
get consistent results EVERY SINGLE TIME.

This is akin to finding out how to raise animals on the least amount of feed
possible. Eventually you find they don't do well.

If you do find the minimum amount of the stock developer needed, use more
than this amount to cover the glitches that will arise when you process an
important roll or sheet.

Plan on a Utah photo trip in August 2002. Brigham City Museum Gallery will
host a photographic show, The Great American West: The B&W Landscape.
It features the images of Dick Arentz, Paula Chamlee Tillman Crane, Chip
Hooper, Craig Law, Ray McSavaney, Barry Parsons, John Sexton, Dan Smith and
Michael A. Smith.
This a show you don't want to miss and a perfect time to visit Utah on your
vacation. Brigham City is in Northern Utah, about an hour North of Salt Lake
City, home of the Bear River
Migratory Bird Refuge and on the way to Yellowstone National Park.
If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me for information as
I am the curator of the show.

Al, 
I have been using my JOBO rotary processor (at high speed) without prewet for 
several years - with Rodinal, Xtol as well as PMK without any problems.

When in my other darkroom (in onother country) I use steel tanks and hand 
agitation.
Both methods give full control, including soft development if wanted. I just 
give less time in the JOBO.

(I process 120 & 135 films)

So why worry - forget the prewet.

Best regards,
Jan

Hello !
Not exactly so. My question serve a really important purpose.
I plan to use a JOBO CPE2 Plus to process film. This machine is only
able to handle 600 CC
of chemistry without straining the motor.
If you look at the 1500 series tank, the CPE2 can handle up to 6 120
film in exactly 570 CC.
It is quite equivalent to 6 135 films in surface, so if I stick with the
1+50 dikution for Rodinal, this will be about 12 CC of pure Rodinal, so
near 1 CC Rodinal per film..... I think it is quite small.
So I thought I could reverse the thinking, If I know the minimal amount
of pure Rodinal needed to process one film, I could figure the amount of
water to add. And then I can split this total amount in x times 600 CC
not to strain the motor....
Is my thinking clear and accurate or is it foolish ?
Best regards !

Sounds like a great idea - if you want to complicate life for 
yourself and risk your films.
Why not flex your muscles with some manual tank twisting instead, and 
get the additional benefit of  saving  time and money  you would 
otherwise have spent at the 'centre de musculation', or the gym to 
our overseas friends. Paterson has a good 8-film tank, that's about 
3.5 kilos with liquid
Alternatively you could try Rodinal 1+15, that would be 36ml Rodinal 
in your tank and 6 ml per film. And short processing times.

Clear and accurate! I know (or could look up) the minumum for T-Max RS
developer, which I use, but that won't help you. Contact Agfa, they should
know the minumum amount of chemical per square inch of film. If they don't
for some unimaginable reason, try Jobo, and failing that The View Camera
Store (was Darkroom Innovations) who make BTZS tubes.

You are exactly right that this is crucial information, something too often
overlooked with disastrous results by those using various forms of rotary
processors and/or high dilutions. Luck!

Someone recently posted an address or company name that had stage lighting
filters for sale. I've lost the address and would appreciate any help in
finding it again as they are the only source for the IR filters in 12 inch
squares I know of. I desperately need to replace one! { Can't print with my
"new" enlarger head until I find it and am having photographic
withdrawals...:o) }
 Thanks for any help,
   Chuck

If you know the minimum required you will still need to use more than that
from stock to be assured of full development of your film. Staying with the
minimum won't do it. If, as you suggested, you want to know the minimum so
you don't go below that, then double it for the sake of repeatability when
processing.

Plan on a Utah photo trip in August 2002. Brigham City Museum Gallery will
host a photographic show, The Great American West: The B&W Landscape.
It features the images of Dick Arentz, Paula Chamlee Tillman Crane, Chip
Hooper, Craig Law, Ray McSavaney, Barry Parsons, John Sexton, Dan Smith and
Michael A. Smith.
This a show you don't want to miss and a perfect time to visit Utah on your
vacation. Brigham City is in Northern Utah, about an hour North of Salt Lake
City, home of the Bear River
Migratory Bird Refuge and on the way to Yellowstone National Park.
If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me for information as
I am the curator of the show.

You might try Lee Filters in the UK.
Worth giving them a call even if they don't advertise that specific size.

Hi Chuck,

I don't know how convenient it would be for you, but San Diego Stage Lighting
carries everything you could ever need.

Good Luck,

When I use a Jobo, I run a 1 minute pre wash , but a 5 
minute dry tank, to stabilize the temperature of the film to 
the process, more critical with E6.

Presumably your darkroom is close to the same temp as your 
B&W developing but not up to the temp of an E6 line of 101F.

Agfa might know, but they will not tell you.

I have talked to Brand Managers and Technical Information people at 
their Head Office in Germany, but they will not tell you anything 
that is not written in their technical lliterature. And that is that 
you need 10 ml Rodinal per film. The most they will say is that you 
may get away with using less, but how much less, that they will not 
say. Try it out ourself, they say.

If you want to try your luck, here is the direct number to call: + 
49-221-5717-223 and Mr Scotland is the Technical Information Manager.

My usual 1+50 dilution for a single 36exp 35mm film in a Paterson tank is
6mm Rodinal in 300ml water. Never had any apparent problems of uneven
development or whatever. Equally, no problems with 5ml + 500ml water for a
1+100 dilution. What you say is interesting though - maybe I'll try a 10ml
minimum next time.  

Getting any sort of info out of Agfa is an uphill struggle in my experience
...  On one occasion in my early days I found myself with a roll of Agfapan
25, a bottle of Rodinal, and an Agfa data booklet, all three of which gave
a different development time for that film/dev combo. A bit worrying for a
beginner!

Richard

I have been using the two tray fix method for the past months.

My question is:

How do I know when to discard the 1st tray?  Without counting 25 8x10
prints - is there a test to determine if the print has been properly fixed?

thanks,

Myron

I just joined the list yesterday.  I look forward to getting to know you
guys.

I am a landscape / fine art photographer from Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada.
I do all my own black and white work.  Right now I shoot exclusively 35mm.
Eventually, when my budget permits, I'll acquire a larger-format system to
complement my Nikon gear.

My current film developer of choice is PMK - I'm getting to know its quirks
and strengths.  It's heavenly with Tri-X.  I'm just learning how it works
with other films so that I can decide what films I prefer to use with it.  I
use it with an alkaline developer from Photographer's Formulary.

I do most of my printing on Ilford Multigrade IV paper (usually RC,
sometimes FB), developed in either Kodak Dektol or Ilford Bromophen.  (I
vascillate over which I prefer, but I lean toward Bromophen.)

Jim

Myron,

Make a 10% solution of potassium iodide and keep in a dropper bottle.

To test the fixer, take about 30 ml of your first fixer solution and add a
few drops (~5). if you gete a "permanent" white precipitate, the fixer is
as good as "dead". The time to move the second fix bath to first fix bath
position is when you get a white precipitate that will "disappear" with a
little agitation.

I have known those who dump the first fix after a given number of prints
but will often forget to count the greater number of test prints....I much
prefer the KI method.

Ken

  Right, I process at room temperature, although sometimes in the summer it
feels like it's 101F.

alkali - sodium metaborate} that I can use with Pyro developers to use as an
after bath { stain  enhancer}. I believe that I have read somewhere that a 5
g / liter solution can be used. To speed things up and allow me to not have
to constantly mix this solution is there a gallon/ 4 liter amount of some
stock solution that I could mix up and would keep for long times.  With the
size tanks I use { Jobo} I need about 500 ml to use as the after bath and
would like some concentration of stock solution that would be easily mixed
by volume...possibly something like a 1 to 4 dilution that would be easy to
measure. I'm also not sure about the keeping properties of a stock solution
as all of the info I have read just instructs me to mix from powder stock
for each run.

 The other help I need is how to properly mix a stock solution of the KI
hypo check that has been mentioned by  Ken Sinclair in his recent post on
the subject.  Would I just mix 10G KI in 100ml of distilled water and allow
the solution to sit on a shelf for long times? { I guess I'm also asking
about the keeping properties}
 I've used Edwald Hypo Check for years but would prefer to mix my own.{ any
trouble with dipping out a liter from a roller transport machine that
doesn't run replenishment and running the test on it? }

 Thanks,
 Chuck

Hello !
Planning to go mixing my own film and paper developpers, I wonder about
which
chemicals to buy, and in what amount.
If I'm quite sure I will go for acetic acid for stop bath, I wonder for
film and
paper dev, or fix.
Also, which formulas would you recomend for such a use ?

You can use the used developer, too.  This is what I do.

I make up 500 ml aliquots of Sodium metaborate for use with my
Pyrogallol... my metol/pyro bottle is only half that due to the 1:2:100
dilution factor. although I occasionally will use it a little higher. There
is no reason that a similar amount made up and set aside for an after-bath
in the Jobo.. Sice I generally tray process I can drop it back into the
ox-tail soup-like developer for staining. I have found that the Na
metaborate to be stable for quite some time.. and, using only distilled
water, I have found full unopened bottles just as effective after 18
months.

This would then become your stock solution that you could use as the
stain-forming afterbath, at the same dilution as the original developer...
10ml in 500 ml.  Since the solution is one of only sodium metaborate there
should be no problems of storing it in amounts of lower concentration.

When employed at a large research institution I used the two-bath fixer
routine. The fix was "tested" before each day-long printing session and at
various times throughout the day. When there was evidence of a precipitate
that lasted beyond about 5 seconds the fixing bath was changed. According
to my experience, pouring the "tested" 30 ml back into to the tray did not
have any "bad" effects.

A  500 ml bottle of test solution would last about a year... it might go
slightly yellowish after a month or so but worked just as well. I might
suggest that 10g KI in 100 ml of distilled water will do just fine.

Ken

Yes, the author said seconds, not inversions. I liked that because I use a
Paterson tank and for stop bath, fix and rinse I do not invert the tank but
twist the little agitator that comes with the tank  and which turns the
reel inside the tank. I inverse the tank during the development cycle to
avoid uneven development, but not for  the other baths as I am not unduly
worried about uneven stopping. It has to be complete and overstopping is
difficult to imagine. Or am I wrong?

Someone poste what looked like a very interesting article on Tri-X in HC110

lost it & wiped it out. Would the author be kind enough to repeat. Many

Don't bother doing all that pre-mixing. Instead buy some sodium carbonate
(a.k.a. PH Adjuster for pools). You can get several pounds for $10-15 from
any pool supply outlet, including K-Mart, Wall-Mart, etc.

When you are ready to process film measure out about 25-50g and dissolve in
a liter of water. 25-50g is about 1/2 to 1 35mm film full (actually you can
use 10-15g if you need to), you don't need to weight. Place the film in the
stain soak for about 2 minutes.

If you are really into darkroom chemistry mixing I recommend Anchel's
Darkroom Cookbook as a good begining reference.

Good Luck,

Don Bryant

 I've been doing this for the last few years but started noticing extensive
staining about a foot in diameter around the drain in the sink I have my
Jobo in. I  am trying to be as safe as I can be with the Pyro and am trying
to avoid any possibility of dust being formed by the Pyro splashing when
dumping. I now have the Jobo set up to dump straight into the drain pipe
with no splash into the sink. By doing it this way I can't collect the used
developer for reuse. I've done sheet film in a tray at times using Pyro with
no ill effects and guess that I'm probably being over cautious these days.

That's wise.  I always wear gloves when I use pyrogallol developers (I don't
know if it's necessary and I hate them but I feel better).  I've never
bothered wearing a mask - I buy the chemistry premixed in liquid form and
I'm careful to clean any spills.  I dump the used developer into the sink
with running water.

Don't go do this without checking first ;) , but it's my recollection that
the B part of PMK can be mixed to act as your staining bath.  The developing
agents are in part A.  Part B is sodium metaborate and water.  Or you could
just buy sodium metaborate from a place like Photographer's Formulary in
Montana.

Don't bother doing all that pre-mixing. Instead buy some sodium carbonate
(a.k.a. PH Adjuster for pools). You can get several pounds for $10-15 from
any pool supply outlet, including K-Mart, Wall-Mart, etc.
And snipped also........

Thanks !
 I'm actually Kodalk rich right now!!
 I actually have about 15 lbs of  sodium metaborate left over that I had
purchased for mixing other chemicals and doubt that I'll be able to use it
up unless I use it for every thing that comes along :o)
 I had a chance to buy 5 lbs for 21 dollars or 25 lbs for 34 dollars and
said why not! :o))
I still have about 4 lbs of Pot. ferricyanide that is left over from another
"great deal" and have no earthly idea how long it will take to use it up
unless I try bleaching the stains out of a couple of wooden fences!  :o)

 Sucker for a great deal,
Chuck

Mike, add Unique Photo to your list.  While B&H, adorama, 
Freestyle, Samy's Camera also come to mind.

1800 631-0300 Unique Rich Kelley is the salesman that I use. 
  You will find that all mail order places have the 
specialty.  I noticed that Agfa products seem much higher 
from Freestyle than Unique.

Thanks, EJ.  I us Ilford.  I am in high school and taking a class in 
photography.  Unfortunately our 'class' has limited resources.  We have two 
enlargers and the Nun that treaches photography is scarce on knowldege of 
even working a camera or enlarger much herself.  Basically we are studing out 
of books and doing trial and error work on our own doing our best not to put 
our eyes out.

We have a small school, 17 students in my entire grade!  Two grades in the 
same room with one teacher.

We just have to made do with what we have.  I did buy my own enlarger at a 
yard sale and do my printing at home.   My mom is afraid she will be poisoned 
soaking in the bathtub where I do my final rinse.  (Will she???)  I wash the t
ub out good when I am done.

 I need to buy what I can as cheaply as I can.

Hi Mike !
I can't tell for USA paper source, living in Europe.
But for your bath tub, May I suggest that you use a big tray (the
biggest you can buy a a yard sale) and a Kodak tray siphon. This way you
will prevent your mother "poisonning". You can put a reversed bowl in
the center of the tray you use for washing and the prints will circle
rount this, not sticking together.
If you want a "perfect" wash with this method, do not place a lot of
prints in the tray.
BTW, try to keep kitchen ustensils in the kitchen, and buy or
permanently borrow ustensils for photographic use. Some times, fixer or
thing like that stick to the funnel for example,and give bad taste to
the next kooking..... 
Hope this helps !

Hello !
Yes, I do agree. I've tried to contact Agfa for some questions (chemical
and paper batch codes, APX 25 availability, etc.) and was unable to get
a response. The belgian web site used to have a news group dedicated to
Agfa products (chemical) the las time I checked, this one has gone, and
has been replaced by a lot if DI stuff...
This is why I ask this knowledgeable list.
My attempt to use the Jobo for B&W film processing is because I went
back from vacation with a great bunch of 120 film of different brands,
and was "killed" to process these, being only able to process two at a
time.
A Jobo tech rep told me to split the required amount of chemical in 600
CC parts and cut the dev. time in the same proportion, changing the dev.
at each time. (the PMK users already do that). So I was able to process
with Xtol because Kodak warn that one must use 100CC stock for one film
(135 or 120). But for more dilute dev, I've no idea. I think that the
Jobo idea to split the dev. time may not be chemically correct, as the
by products of the reaction will disappear at the middle of the way...
But maybe it's worth a try ?
Nevertheless, I'll thank you for the feedback you gave !

Mike,  You might also try contacting Ilford, Cachet, 
Bergger, sales and ask for sample packets.  It is quite 
possible that the samples may help fill your needs.  I would 
look into the Cachet papers as a reasonable priced product. 
  The last time I purchased some Agfa through Unique it was 
$32 for 100 sh 8x10 RC.

Your mom should be fine, as long as your sister ( if you 
have one) doesn't use the bath tub to transplant her herbs 
and let the soil clog the drain.  This happened to me.  We 
had an orange tub for many years as I was using indicator 
stop bath and I was dumping my chemicals for the night. At 
first I thought that the plug was just stuck, but even extra 
water didn't help.

You might also check into Freestyle's house brand for the 
cheap stuff.

Good luck

EJ Neilsen

I too use old developer.  It seems to stain better than the 
meta bath on some films.

I use the following procedure when using a variant of PMK, ABC+ (aka
RolloPyro):

Pre-wash: 10ml B (the SodiumMetaBorate solution) in 500 ml water, 5 min.
Develop in ABC+ (mixing A + B + water)
Water stop
Fix
2 water washes
After stain: 10ml B (the SodiumMetaBorate solution) in 500 ml water, 5
min.
Wash
Rinse in diluted photflow/Isoprop/dest. water

There is a guy on Ebay who sells boxes of 8x10 "Vesta"
paper for $18 per 100 sheets - VC cool tone RC paper.
I was with someone else at the Brown U. Darkroom who
had the regular sotore bought Ilford Multigrade RC
paper and it wa absolutely identical. We printed the
same shot using the same filtration and time and put
it in the developer together. The shots were
identical, same color, texture, contrast, everything.
I recently ordered more and when it came it was in a
box where the "8x10" was in that same ilford block
letters. The erst of the box had other markings ripped
off of it. I think he is at Directfoto@aol.com or
something like that. Look on ebay. I've probably used
700 sheets of the stuff. It's great paper even if it
isn't really ilford (But I'm sure it is.).

Just a note about stains from toner in or on the bathtub.  But some powder 
cleaner with chlorine and sprinkle some on the stain and leave it sit for a 
while.  Be generous with the powder and wet the spot first.  I have had to 
leave it over night but the spots were gone the next day when I rinsed out 
the tub.

The formula given in Anchel's book is the G-262 recipe. Do you have the
G-261 formula?

Also is Photographers Formulary the only source now for glycin? The price
for this ingredient is pretty steep.

Thanks for your reply,

Here in the UK we have a major photo retail chain called Jessops. They used
to buy their own brand paper in Croatia, but when supplies became difficult
because of the troubles in the Balkans, the paper changed. I recognised the
packing as Ilford, and found that the graded and VC Jessops were Ilfospeed
and Multigrade respectively. The price was about 2/3 of Ilford. This lasted
perhaps 3 years. They changed again last year. I expected them to be
Croatian again, but the whisper is that it is actually Agfa. Certainly, step
wedge tests show the VC paper to have a contrast range identical to
Multicontrast. However, Agfa don't apparently make graded papers, yet there
are still Jessops brand graded. So this is a little mystery. However, the
paper is top quality for an RC, and there seems little reason for all normal
work prints to pay for a premium brand.
It is quite noticeable that here in the UK, Ilford Multigrade Cooltone seems
to be sticking on the shelves. Quite a lot of the opening promotion cut
price stocks still seem to be available if you shop around.
People seem to much prefer warm to cold tone - big difference from the 1960s
and 1970s when cold tone ruled the roost.

There is a guy on Ebay who sells boxes of 8x10 "Vesta"
paper for $18 per 100 sheets - VC cool tone RC paper.
I was with someone else at the Brown U. Darkroom who
had the regular sotore bought Ilford Multigrade RC
paper and it wa absolutely identical. We printed the
same shot using the same filtration and time and put
it in the developer together. The shots were
identical, same color, texture, contrast, everything.
I recently ordered more and when it came it was in a
box where the "8x10" was in that same ilford block
letters. The erst of the box had other markings ripped
off of it. I think he is at Directfoto@aol.com or
something like that. Look on ebay. I've probably used

isn't really ilford (But I'm sure it is.).

Did you notice any change in image tone using the different dilutions? I
guess that is supposed to be one of their main selling points with this
developer.

Subject: LPD Dilution, problem



Last spring I did a little testing with LPD.

I printed the same print with the following dillutions:
1:1   1:2   1:4   1:8

The problem I encountered was with the 1:8. It seemed very inconsistant
and was exhausted very fast. I stayed with 1:4 and things seemed fine.

However, the few prints I did at 1:8 turned out a wonderful warm tone.

I don't know about you, but when I find a good paper, I like to stick with
it for awhile.  If Jessops changes suppliers every fortnight, how can you
possibly get used to what they're selling?  ;)

You might try Artcraft, but I'm not sure if thay carry it. Also,
search chemical supply catalogs for N-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-glycine, 
4-hydroxyphenylglycine, and 4-hydroxyphenylaminoacetic acid.

These are the formulas for a number of Gevaert 
paper developers whose composition and conditions
of use illustrate most of the basic principles of
paper developer formulation. The formulas are old,
as well as the papers for which they were designed.
Most warm tone papers of that era were chloride based,
like AZO, or slow fine grain chlorobromide papers.

Gevaert Paper Developers

G-251: General paper developer - if diluted, more 
exposure may be required for the same contrast; 
softer with same exposure

G-252: Developer for Blue-Black Tones - use undiluted 
for 1 minute; adjust exposure as required

G-253: Developer for Soft Effects (lower contrast) - 
by adding 10% bromide solution, warmer tones may 
result with warm tone papers (try 1 fl. oz. increments; 
adjust exposure as required)

G-261: Warm Tone Glycin Developer - warmer tones with 
dilution, but developing times should be increased.

G-262: Warm-Tone Hydroquinone Developer - diluted from 
1+2 to 1+6; tones are similar to G-261, however, less 
exposure is required. G-261 is more consistent.

Artcraft does sell it because they cannot find a supplier. Mike Jacobsen
tried to have some made but subsequent chemical analysis determined that the
molecular structure wasn't correct (what ever that means, I'm not a
chemist). I will take your advice and look for the two chemicals listed
above.

Thanks for sharing your expertise and your formula.

The compound is synthesized from chloroacetic acid and p-aminophenol in
an appropriate solvent, and then it can be crystalized as the hydrocloric
acid salt.
The exact procedures are in the literature - it isn't difficult at all.
However, the
product won't be inexpensive due to the time involved, etc.

I checked the web, and it appears that that China exports the compound,
and either Belgium or the Netheralnds (I don't recall which). Interchem
Corp.
<www.interchem.com> was listed in a manufacturing directory as a source,
but I didn't see it on the web site. You might want to check the site and
drop 
them a note.

Acros Organics in Belgium is a supplier of N-(4-Hydroxyphenyl)glycine
<http://www.acros.be>, and in the US and CA, Acros is distributed
by Fisher Scientific. <http://www.fishersci.com>
<http://www.fishersci.ca>

It is very expensive for use as a developer since it is sold as a
research
chemical..

References for the synthesis are:

Vater; J. Prakt. Chem. 29, 291 (1884)
Meldola et al.; J. Chem Soc. 111, 552 (1917)
Galatis; Helv. Chim. Acta 4, 576 (1921)

I'm _NOT_ recommending that anyone synthesize the compound.
Actually, anyone qualified to do it should know the details and
have the experience to proceed _without_ reading the articles.
If not, they don't have the background to work safely.

Hi,

I'm a new poster to this list, so I hope this question isn't
redundant...

I'm looking to start printing in platinum in addition to silver and I
have been reading about using Pyro based developers to produce image
stain which allows the same neg to be used for both processes. But since
I am still working in a co-op darkroom I thought it prudent to
investigate less toxic developers.

I have recently heard about a new staining/tanning developer called
DiXactol and wonder if anyone on the list has had experiences using
DiXactol to develop negatives for platinum printing or better still both
platinum and silver.

Any experience or advice would be most welcome!

Thanks!

Guy

I don't know about you, but when I find a good paper, I like to stick with
it for awhile.  If Jessops changes suppliers every fortnight, how can you
possibly get used to what they're selling?  ;)



I take your point Jim. However, once a fortnight is slightly more often than
the 3 years it seemed to take, and if you use a lot of paper, as I do, and
run a few simple tests with a step wedge when new emulsions arrive, there
isn't much hassle.
As it happens, the new Jessops graded paper is an almost exact match for the
previous Jessops-branded Ilfospeed in speed and contrast. It just doesn't
tone or alter image colour with change of developer quite as much as the old
type. There aren't exactly many graded RC papers left, and the Jessops is
readily available - Indeed, far more readily available than Ilfospeed.

Hi Guy
I'm the maker and marketer of DiXactol (in the US it comes via
Photographers' Formulary). For the purposes for which you want the developer
i.e. to get a dual contrast neg. to print hard on Platinum and soft for
silver, DiXactol will not give you as good results as PMK. DiXactol's stain
is brown and is much more consistent in amount and colour across various
films - that was one of the reasons I evolved this solution for greater
consistency of printing characteristics across films and papers. However, if
you choose the right film - HP5 Plus for instance - the yellow/green stain
of PMK is greater than DiXactol's stain, and will give a higher printing
density with Platinum.
Did you know that you can bleach a negative developed in a conventional
developer then redevelop it in PMK, or DiXactol for that matter, to
introduce the stain? You can repeat the bleach and redevelop cycle to get an
even greater stain. Three times is normal the number of cycles beyond which
no greater stain is apparent.
The dangers of working with pyrogallol are greatly exaggerated. There is a
'scare factor' about it. Use normal; reasonable precautions when working
with it and there is no risk above working with more conventional
developers. If you have to mix it from raw chemicals, you need to be much
more careful, of course. In particular, a breathing mask with the 'floaty'
pyro powder is a must.
When working with premixed solutions though, use of gloves is a good idea,
as it is with many chemicals - selenium toner for instance. The same sort of
extraction ventilation we should use with most chemicals solutions in
processing is also wise.

I'm a new poster to this list, so I hope this question isn't
redundant...

I'm looking to start printing in platinum in addition to silver and I

Barry,

Thanks for your fast and very refreshingly honest response about DiXactol. It is
nice to find some one honest enough to clearly state his products strengths and
weaknesses. While  for 4x5 I'm going to have to take the Pyro plunge, for 35
DiXactol sounds like just what I have been looking for.

Thanks again for your help and guidance!

Guy

I wanted to thank everyone that offered help and encouragement on list as well as
off.  I got a liberal education right here.  I am finding references and
materials.  I no longer feel totally ignorant of the procedures for making a basic
8x10 contact print.  And now the fun begins...

Thanks to a great group.

We are posting this publically as it may also interest others and hoping
that Barry may be able to respond ...

Having tried numerous film/developer combinations and settled on
Dixactol with Delta 100 (35mm) and HP5 (120) as the combinations of
choice, there are a few fine tune questions that would be helpful to understand:

Q. What is meant by a 'water stop-bath' ?  Good old fashioned H2O with
nothing added ?

Q. How many inversions is intended every 30 secs when developing ?  Just
one ?

Q. Other than being able to mix different film types in a single
development process, why would anyone want to use the two bath method ?

Regards
Malcolm & Sylvia

All

Thanks for the advice and comments following my earlier question on the
difficulties in loading Patterson 120 reels.  I have been away for a
week in the UK, hence the delay.  It was just a tad windy and wet :-(

You gave lots of good tips to try.  I have now had time to also try my
proven 35mm technique of trimming a small 45 degree angle of the corner
of the leading edge and it worked like a charm.  For anyone interested
this was a great improvement.  Loaded 3x120 films in a changing bag
(slightly sweaty palms) using a mixture of old and new spools with no
problem in about 10 mins :-)  Just think what I will be able to do with
all the other improvement techniques on top of that.

Thanks for the inputs.

Regards
Malcolm

All

How do you accurately measure small quantities of liquid down to as
little as 1ml please ?

Small measuring beakers are not accurate at this volume, eye drop
pippets are OK but not exactly high resolution and weighing scales
strike me as less than convenient for liquids.

What should I use and where could I buy it please ?  We live near San
Jose, California.

You can buy a 5ml graduated oral syringe from any chemist/drugstore,
used to administer medicine to kids, alternatively you could get a
scientific grade measuring pipette for lots more money.

Hi M&S,
A couple of suggestions here:
1.  Laboratory type pipettes -- any lab supply store would have these
     safety note:  DO NOT use mouth suction to draw fluids into the
     pipettes.
2.  Syringes -- watch out what chemicals you use -- the rubber tips on
     the plungers may react with the rubber.  Insulin type syringes are
     quite small in total capacity.
3.  Accurate scale and knowledge of the specific gravity of the liquid.

HTH

The best method is to use a pipette.  They come in two types that are
calibrated TD (To Deliver).  One is designed to simply drain leaving a bit
of residual liquid in the tip while the other type is designed to be blown
out.  The blow out type is usually designated as a serological pipette.
They come in various volumes from 1 mL on up.   They are available in glass
or plastic and are designated as either disposable (cheapest) or reusable.
Can be purchased from laboratory supply houses (usually in  fairly large
packages.  They may have a broken carton where you could buy a couple of
units.  The other possibility would be a local medical lab or clinic which
has its own lab.  Try to get a few from them.  The plastic disposable type
would be fine for most photographic chemicals (except glacial acetic acid
which will attack polystyrene).  HC-110 will be difficult to measure due to
its high viscosity.

It is a recommended safety procedure NOT TO PIPETTE BY MOUTH!  Use a rubber
bulb to suck the liquid into the pipette.  Do not want to get a mouth full
of Pyro stock solution or acetic acid!!!!!!! <(:-0)

     Howard F. Efner

I use Pipettes and syringes both to transfer the liquid into a glass beaker 
that holds
25ml.  My developed film is a lot more consistent now.  I also added about 
6 inches of plastic tubing to the syringes so I can access the bottom of 
the bottle of Part A PMK Pyro.  The other thing is that I would recommend 
is a digital thermometer.  I looked at the ones in the chem lab house when 
I got the pipette and syringes and decided that $100.00 or so dollars was 
more than I could pay.  I found one at a local hardware store.  I paid 
$15.00.  After checking all the analog thermometers I have, only one 
matched the digital.  I have a Kodak glass thermometer and that was the one 
I was not using.  Things improved soon after that.
         Oh, Malcom there is a Lab supply house near the Burbank 
airport.  I can supply the name and phone number if you wish.  They have a 
web site and order system.  You can buy one's and two's there no problem at 
all and ask for the catalog when you call.

  If you have any pets, ask your veterinarian for some small syringes of
the type used to give animals meds. I don't believe a needle can be affixed
to these, so there shouldn't be that concern.
  I have some old-style all-glass syringes and some long needles; those
work wonderfully but the needles can be a little hazardous. Then again,
nothing will clear lurkers out of a darkroom faster than letting go
maniacal laughter while waving around a syringe with a six-inch needle
attached. <g>

Malcolm,  as the others have suggested, pipettes are a very 
good way to go.  If you are doing a lot of small units of 
the same type, you may also consider a buret.  You would 
need a stand to hold it, but they will also accurately 
measure very small amounts of liquids.  I have some pipettes 
that measure down to 1/100 of a ml. (useful for contrast 
agents in platinum printing).  TriEss Sciences are down in 
burbank, VWR can be found on the web although they have 
higher prices.  Bryant Labs in Oakland or Berkeley is a good 
source for many chemicals and some lab items.  I believe 
that they'll have what you need and you can go hang out at 
Yoshi's for a while and hear some good jazz.


As for not using your mouth for drawing the solution up - it 
is not a good idea, but..... it is your health.  live long 
and prosper :)

Other lab item suppliers, Photographers' Formulary, Edmonds 
Scientific, Fisher Scientific,... When I was in Taos, NM we 
had Los Alamos close by.  There was a used scientific 
warehouse, Ed Grothus (sp?) He may ship.  I'm sure with all 
the high tech stuff going on in Livermore and Stanford, 
there must be a used dealer out there.

Good Luck

Guy, As an experienced platinum printer, I would agree with 
Barry.  I have only done a little testing of DiXactol it 
does not have the right stain for platinum.  It does make 
beautiful negatives for silver printing.

Have fun with platinum

The Formulary also sells them in several sizes, I believe 
1,10,25 ml sizes.

Bob F,
         Here is one of them.    I cannot seem to find the catalog for 
Tri-Ess at the moment but I will find it to day.  This one is in the LA 
Basin too.  www.chemlab.com  This place has all the same stuff.  Maybe Eric 
has the Tri-Ess catalog.

If you are not easily offended by the weird and silly you might try what I 
tried just a moment ago.  I typed in www.triess.com  just to see if maybe 
that was the site URL and it is a support group in Tucson,Az for cross 
dressers.  Go figure!

A tuberculin or insulin syringe should be able to
measure out exactly 0.05 ml with ease. The whole
syringe holds 1 ml.

Go find a junkie & borrow his hypodermic syringe.

Seriously, go to a pharmacy & get a syringe. They work well and aren't
illegal.

Plan on a Utah photo trip in August 2002. Brigham City Museum Gallery will
host a photographic show, The Great American West: The B&W Landscape.
It features the images of Dick Arentz, Paula Chamlee Tillman Crane, Chip
Hooper, Craig Law, Ray McSavaney, Barry Parsons, John Sexton, Dan Smith and
Michael A. Smith.
This a show you don't want to miss and a perfect time to visit Utah on your
vacation. Brigham City is in Northern Utah, about an hour North of Salt Lake
City, home of the Bear River
Migratory Bird Refuge and on the way to Yellowstone National Park.
If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me for information as
I am the curator of the show.

Well today (finally) is the day tundraware.com moves to DSL.  I have arranged
the DNS stuff so that you should see a minimal amount of disruption of
pure-silver, but it is likely that the list will be intermittently available
at least over the next day or so (and possibly more).  Sorry for the
inconvenience, but we should be back soon.  Keep trying in case you 
do get a failure.

tundraware.com has been successfully converted to a new DSL feed.  pure-silver
is thus active again.  However... it takes a while for the internet name servers
(DNS/bind) to figure out that the ip address for the pure-silver mailing list
manager has changed.  Depending on your ISP, it can take several days for this
fact to register with their servers.  In general, it should be much less than
this...

>From your point of view, *nothing* has changed, and the list should operate
as always.

Thanks for your patience as always...

Can anyone suggest a film / developer combination which generates lots of grain in the neg.
Preferably whilst retaining film speed. I hear that Rodinal may be good for this but I'm not sure.

How much grain?  Tmax 3200 and Rodinal would do it, or Rodinal with
anything, HP5 in Rodinal at 1:100 is interesting and less extreme than
TMAX 3200.

Rob,

I second the vote for Tmax 3200 in Rodonol. I shoot it at ISO 800.  The more you enlarge it, the
grainier it gets.

Kodak Recording Film in almost any developer would be the best choice.
Rodinal is a fairly grainy developer and would be a good choice.  Avoid
D-76/ID-11 and XTOL since they have a mild solvent effect that somewhat
masks grain (at the expense of sharpness).

If you don't want to use Recording Film, you could try a traditional 400 or
faster emulsion and simply crop.

One approach I've used in the past is to use heated Dektol as a film developer.
You'll have to experiment w/ time & temp.  Start at about 85 F.

Keep in mind that the subsequent stop and fix should be near the same temp
as the developer or you can get reticulation of the emulsion - itself
a rather interesting effect.  If you want both, heat the Dektol and make
your stop bath a lot colder...

Try Fuji Neopan 1600 rated at 1600.  The grain seems more well-defined than TMax
3200.

First, I'd like thank everyone who responded to post regarding C-41 BW film.
The information and opinions were very helpful.  Now I'd like to pose another
question, this time on split filter printing.  I recently read Joe Englander's
1995 article on the subject, but I found that the procedure he used,
particularly using a JOBO testprinter, rather vague.  I think I have the steps
down so you develop half the exposure for the low contrast then rotate the
testprinter and develop for the rest of the exposureusing different filter
settings, but I'm not sure how to read the results.  Does anyone have any
experience with this technique?

Thank You

David Logeman

Yes Rodinal and a fast film is a good option. Expose the film so you get
good shadow detail
and develop the film in Rodinal for a time to give a low contrast negative
with easily printable
highlights. Then print on a hard grade of paper to make up for the low
negative contrast. In this
way you can get a print with good shadow and highlight detail but with
emphasised grain due to
the hard paper. By matching the film development time to different paper
grades you can adjust
the amount of grain in the printed image whilst maintaining good tone
separation in shadows and
highlights.
You just have to be a bit more careful with keeping the negative scratch and
dust free because
any imperfections will be emphasised by the hard paper.

I've never quite understood the reason behind using more than one filter -
either of the Ilford MG type or of the Yellow or Magenta CC type - when
printing on VC paper.  There is no advantage over using the single,
appropriate, filter to achieve the desired contrast balance.  I've been
doing this for 35 years, understand the logic of the other side's argument
but, in the final analysis, appears to be another myth in need of
de-bunking.  As I alsways tell my students - keep it as simple as possible
to achieve the desired result.  Split filter printing appears unecessarily
complicated in this regard.

Hi David,

The JOBO testprinter is a great tool to quickly and consistently do
exposure/contrast tests when printing.

What you are referring to is the single sheet method.

You start by exposing with the test printer in one orientation for the low
contrast which gives you a series of timing strips with different exposures
running across the page.
Then by changing to the setting (or filter) to the high contrast and then rotating
the testprinter at a right angle to the initial strips, making the exposure and
developing, you can now see on a single sheet all of the values for high contrast
exposures running in one direction and low contrast exposures in the other and how
they work together.

I still sometimes find it too confusing and instead prefer to do the two paper
method.

On one sheet use the testprinter and the low contrast setting to choose a base
exposure for the highlights.

Then on a second sheet of paper do this low contrast base exposure. Then change
the setting/filter for the high contrast and with the testprinter make the test
exposure on the same piece of paper.

With these two sheets of paper you will now have enough information to choose your
exposures and also how many stops of burning and dodging will be needed.

Another good JOBO testprinter trick for single filter printing is to cut a 4x5
corner section out of an 8x10 piece of mat board which you can then use as a mask
to get 4 exposures each with a different contrast setting on a single piece of
paper.

Good luck!

Guy

Many thanks to all who replied to my request for US contacts in connection 
with travelling scholarship. i'll be in touch shortly.

I've been commissioned to take a series of lighthouse images over the next 
twelve months. Has anyone got any suggestions - UK, USA, Europe.

Thanks,

David:

I do split filter printing all the time but have never used the Jobo.   I
have found that a smaller piece of paper that will cover the highlight and
the shadow area works best for me.

I won't go into detail but if you would like more information please email
me.

Thanks
Bob

Curt:

Split filter printing works marvelously with negatives that have extreme
tonal ranges.  It is an extremely simple procedure that reduces the amount
of dodging and burning in on some negatives.    I have used the traditional
single filter system for many years and began split filter printing almost a
year ago.  I use it for about 75% of my negatives with noticeable
improvements.  I have taught the system to 6 other members of a photo group
with equal amount of experience and they all love it.  I wish I had learned
it 25 years ago.

Split filter printing is a very simple way to achieve a very high quality
print.   Dodging and burning in takes a tremendous amount of skill and
practice.  Please don't "close the door" on SFP.  It doesn't work all the
time but you would be doing your students a big favor by teaching them both
methods.  Give it some thought.

Thanks,
Bob

I go one step further and say split filter printing is the ONLY use for
mulit-grade or variable contrast paper.

Economy is no excuse of not using graded papers.

Exactly, as I interpet the various positive postings,  this
is its only advantage. If this becomes
SOP, then it is time to reconsider exposure/development
techniques.

Exactly-
Learning to master a skill (instead of fudging a way around
it) is how to learn to become a Master.

That's the first I've heard of that.  It's too bad, but I must confess I've
never actually bought a roll of it, so I'll live... ;)

Neopan 1600 ( I rate it at 800 ) in Rodinal 1+50 gives nice crisp big
grain.  In a recent shot in Glencoe the grain was big enough to mask the
cars in the distance - you'd never know there was even a road!

If less agitation during development makes for a smoother negative with some 
developers, what effect does more agitation give? Does this give a grainier 
effect? Any specific film/dev combinations? I seem to remember Bailey 
mentioning this, maybe with Tri X pushed, but searches so far have not turned 
up the reference.

Ian, as far as lighthouses in the US, there are many to be found on the East
Coast - Maine, Mass., etc.  Also, there are a ring of similar structures to
be found around the Great Lakes on both the US and Canadian side of the
lakes.  The Pacific Northwest is another area.

Split printing is a tool, like any other. I think it is one that 
every printer who prints on VC paper should have in their toolbox, 
regardless of whether he uses it 1% of the time or 95% of the time.

One big advantage is that you get continuous control of contrast[1], 
which is important when you consider that VC papers tend to respond 
erratically to standard filters. E.G if you look at the charts in the 
back of Anchell's "Variable Contrast Printing Manual"[2], you see 
that Polymax Fine-Art G, with Kodak filters, gives the following 
actual contrast grades
   FILTER   CONTRAST
     -1        00
      0         1
      1         1
      2         2
      3         2
     NF         2
      4         4
      5         6
This is an extreme example, admittedly, but it is a problem with any VC paper.

This is not the only reason to use split printing, there are others 
that have been mentioned by other postings here.

Note that unlike <rlb@triad.rr.com>, I don't see split printing as a 
substitute for burning and dodging, but it does give you much more 
control when doing so: I typically dodge during the high-contrast 
exposure and burn during the low-contrast exposure, with brings out 
fine detail in both the highlights and shadows.

That's almost right. To paraphrase Einstein, I'd say "keep it as 
simple as possible to achieve the desired result, BUT NO SIMPLER". 
Dismissing a potentially useful technique simply because it is 
insufficiently simple is silly. The important thing is getting the 
image you want. If you can get it without split printing, or without 
flashing, or without some other specialized technique, great. On the 
other hand, I'm not going to forgo getting the image I want simply 
because I'm unwilling to learn a new technique.

>Split filter printing appears unecessarily
>complicated in this regard.

Again, it's a tool. Once you know how to use it, then you can decide 
whether it works for you or not. Any serious printer should always be 
experimenting with new tools, and adding the ones they find useful to 
their toolbox. Remember, Adams in his later years was fond of saying, 
"I'm still a student."

  Agitation makes no difference whatsoever as long as the films are
developed to the same CI and the agitation method used provides sufficient
evenness.

Why?

The same can be said of the control with a colorhead.  It is continuous.
That's wht I use for VC paper most of the time...either yellow OR magenta,
as needed.

The point is being missed here: you can achieve any print you want - and
even more easily - with single filter printing that you can with two
filter printing.  State another way, there is nothing you can achieve with
two filter printing that you can get with single filter printing with half
the time and labor...nothing.  We've all done this at one time or another
in our printing careers until we learn the simple axiom.  and, I know
there are some famous printers out there who do use two filter printing
but most don't for the reasons cited.  So, it's not a "tool" but rather a
complicated approach to a simple problem...or even a not so simple one
that could more easil be approached with a simple solution.  

Why would one be making such bad negatives in the first place that one
perceived the needs for some special "tool?"

Not so..  Keep to the basics.  Learning is lifelong.  Most printers learn
that split filter printing is sensitometrically and practically a
complicated method for achieving what is achievable with one filter.
Somebody de-bunked this myth during the past year in one of the fine-art
photography mags, though I forget who it was.  It apears that only tyros
keep switching tools and get off track too frequently.

Let's see. If I stand develope on film and cocktail shake

Generally your statement is correct. Specifically, there are

Firstly thanks to all those who have responded to my question. Rodinal seems to be the choice for grainy negs. I will give it a go.

The main purpose of agitation as I understand it is to replenish the developer in the film emulsion which has been used up. Given the same temp and time, increased agitaion will generally generate a negative with greater contrast resulting in the highlights becoming  blocked out. Of course you might reduce development time to compensate for the increased agitation but you will likely alter the shape of the characteristic curve of the film. Since a poor agitation procedure is the most likely cause of streaking and uneven development I would favour giving only the minimum necessary to achieve the required negative density range combined with even development and lack of streaking. Too violent agitation may cause frothing of the developer leading to increased possibility of bubbles becoming lodged on the neg.

Assuming you have or are doing some testing of your development times you should arrive at a development time, temperature, developer dilution and agitation procedure which gives you the negatives you require. If you change the agitation procedure you will also change the negative density range and curve shape.

<SNIP>
Rollo Pyro (aka ABC+ pyro) is designed to oxidize less, than PMK, in the
JOBO expert drums where there is a lot more agitation and exposure to
oxidation.  The slower oxidation will reduce aerial fog formation that can
be seen with PMK.  Other ways around the problem are to nitrogen blanket the
inside of the drum or to use two batches of PMK.  Run 50% of the time with
the first batch, dump, and then add  the second fresh batch.  I do not know
if you can do it with the expert drums, but the oxidation problem can be
overcome in the JOBO sheet film reel drums by running close to liquid full.

Al,

Except for the cost involved, you can purchase a small water chiller for your 
darkroom. Run the chiller through a water mixing valve and attach the outlet 
to the Jobo. The Jobo will then have the cold water it needs to regulate the 
temperature you've set on the control panel.

If you are processing film, you can try using PMK Pyro at 80 degrees instead.

Curt,

Would mind not CC:ing to a mail list? I ask this because doing so invalids
my pure silver folder rules and your e-mails end up in the wrong place.

Thanks,

P.S. BTW, if you reply to all the mail will go to the list. Your intended

which is your intent when you reply to the recipient and CC to the list.

It's Rollo Pyro and it's also going to be a toss up depending if you want to
use any of the aerial oxidization preventive measures that Hutchens includes
in his book { for the PMK }. I ran pretty extensive test with both and
really could not tell any differences as long as I took the precaution to
use two batches of developer instead of one [ split the time in half and ran
two batches}.
 The Rollo Pyro according to Bostic S. is exactly the same formula as PMK
but they add ascorbates as a anti oxidizing agent. I actually had such
similar results that without strict densitometer reading I could tell no
difference at all. Even the times were very similar { not as the
advertisements would lead you to believe.}
The Rollo Pyro instructions advise you to use an afterbath { Kodalk - sodium
metaborate } instead of the used developer being used. Again  I could tell
no real difference but like the Kodalk afterbath as it cuts down greatly on
the handling of PMK and allows you to dump it instead of re use. { just
personal safety thoughts of mine }
 The PMK might last longer as it contains no ascorbates and I'm told that
they may be unstable over time where the PMK seems to have a very long shelf
life.
Either are good developers and will give almost the exact same results.

    One of the easiest ways is to fill the 1000 ml chem. bottles with about
750 ml of water and leave the top off and freeze the water - just put on cap
and drop in a bottle or two and the heater will always be working to keep it
warm. Works great and you can actually use any bottle that will fit into the
chem. bottle slots.

Hi Richard,

According to Hutchings, PMK pyro oxidises too rapidly when rotary processed
in Jobo.

I have never done it in rotary machines, but if you do a "Google" search I
believe the Rollo Pyro has EDTA added..

If you can't find the formula I have it hidden away somewheres on my HD.

Ken



 

I am switching from tray developement to a Jobo for my 8x10 neg processing
.  I have been using Formulary's (USA) PMK in the trays and I am happy with
the results.  I see that Bostick & Sullivan offer what they call "Rollo
Pollo" which is intended for Jobo use.  I believe that it is an ABC Pyro
formula.   > Question: Should I switch to Rollo Pollo when I start my Jobo
tests ?  What makes the formulary better for Jobo.  My gut feeling is to
stick with what I know; PMK.  Anyone who has been down this path, could you
make some suggestions ? > Thanks in advance > richard warren

There may be a terminology problem here. Some people refer to the practice
of burning in with a different filter than was used for the basic exposure
as "split printing."  That may be how the person who posted the original
message and others who have praised "split printing" were using the term.
Burning with a different filter than was used for the basic exposure is a
well accepted tehcnique to use with VC paper. However, that isn't really
"split printing" in the usual sense of the term.

The term "split  printing" more accurately (I think) refers to a technique
whereby two basic exposures are made, one with a high contrast filter and
the other with a low contrast filter. That practice is the one that has been
debunked quite a lot, most notably by Phil Davis in an article published in
Photo Techniques magazine (under its former name) in late 1994.

Dear Al ;
        How about adding an external chiller.  I am pretty sure that
Jobo makes one for their processors or you could always rig one up using
some copper tubing and an old refrigerator.  If you take a big coil of
Copper and put in an old frig,  you can drill holes in the sides of the
frig cause the mechanics are in the rear.  You could make a closed loop
system by running the Cooper tubing through the troft on the JOBO or you
could make it open system by pumping the water from he trough in the
JOBO through the tubing in the refrigerator.  then you just need to add
a thermostatic controlled pump to the system to keep the water at 68
degrees.

Hope this helps
John

Nothing that is apart from local control of contrast which can be very
valuable. Also, if you're using "multigrade" filters you can control
overall contrast to finer than the half-grade steps of the filters.

>that split filter printing is sensitometrically and practically a

Only for a simple straight exposure.  With split filter printing one can
dodge and burn the highlights and shadows separately, which can be a very
useful tool in any printer's armoury.

The various methods of printing with VC papers have evolved because they
offer an alternative way of doing things.  Each has advantages and
disadvantages.  I don't believe any of them are "wrong" (or equally that
any of them are the only "right" way) and I don't believe we should deny
those who want to learn about them the opportunity of doing so.  

So, put simply, the overall contrast is a function of the ratio of the
exposures through the hard and soft filters. To establish the two exposures
I'd suggest starting with the hard filter if you've got a soft negative,
and the soft filter if the neg is hard. The other filter can then be used
to fill in the highlights or shadows respectively. If you dodge and burn
during the hard exposure, you'll mostly affect the black end of the scale,
and if you dodge and burn during the soft exposure you'll affect the white
end. 

Regards
Richard

I post the formula's of both solutions, so one can see that they are
different. I can tell from (sad) experience that the Rollo Pyro goes off
after about 6 months at room  temperature. It does seems to keep better
at 4 degC in tightly stoppered bottles. Also: do not use the fresh brew
straight away: let it age 1-2 days! Otherwise it works perfect in a
JOBO, without changing midways. The credit for the formula should go to
Herald Leban, Austria, the quote is from the alt-photo list by Carl

The messages below seem to be talking about split printing as though it was
the practice of making a single exposure with one filter followed by burning
with a different filter.   That practice is uniformly accepted as a valuable
tool. I don't think anyone would argue with it. However, that isn't what the
term "split printing" normally means (at least not in my experience).

I have a suggestion for all who want to continue this thread. Let's call the
practice of making one basic exposure with one filter, followed by burning
with a separate filter, "burning with a separate filter." Let's call the
practice of making two basic exposures (i.e. two exposures of the entire
print) with two different filters "split printing." That way we'll all know
what each of us is talking about.

P.S. One of the attached messages mentions dodging and burning with separate
filters. I don't offhand know how you could dodge with a separate filter.

Richard -

It simply isn't so.  There is no local contrast problem or correction that
can't be made with a single filter.  Where a benefit does accrue for the
continuous aspect of contrast control WRT variable contrast split-filter
printing is in the use of MG filters.  While I use these with students,
for personal work i typically use yellow or magenta in my colorheads which
gives a totally continuous range as you mention.  With my 8x10 enlarger, I
use some of both - I use a yellow to put my light source where I want it
relative to my 4x5 lights (Aristo v54 in the 8x10 and Chromega heads on
the 4x5s) - then use MG filters to get the contrast I need for my print.

Fred Picker was a strong proponent of the split-filter printing method.
He was also a proponent of exposing a print in 2 (or 5?) second "bursts"
of light.  He also made all means of criticism of condenser light and
touted cold light in its place.  Most of this stuff is pure nonesense.
The problem many of us face is when we try to teach fundamentals to our
students and they come to us with these notions and we need to get them
back on track with the fundamentals.  It saves paper and hair-pulling in
the long run.  

This split-filter printing cost my partner $300 in
materials and 50 hours labor - and two bulbs in our Chromega head - this
past summer. He tried to make 20x24 prints from really poor negatives that
required ridiculous exposure times (exacerbated by printing through
170cc)with 170cc of each magenta and yellow to do his routine.  He hit the
reciprocity curve somewhere along the way and couldn't get to a good print
to save his life.  I took a stab at it.  Found 45cc of magenta is all that
was needed - made a superb exhibition print in 45 minutes on the first
negative.  Too late, the customer had fired his butt and he was out a
week's labor and a box of very expensive paper.  He'd been doing this
split-filter routine for years - learned in his MFA work.  He talked the
local contrast talk, too.  He doesn't talk it much anymore.

One little aside here: why aren't people doing something to correct these
negatives which they believe necessitates split-filter printing?  Why
aren't they either using PMK or masking to make a better negative that
will yield a superb print without the chenanigans.  PMK can even be used
in a bleach/redevelop of bad negatives.  These solutions go a lot further
towards achieving perfection in the print...and those who know my work
know my demands for perfection in printing.

Regards,
Curt

Subject: Keep Jobo Cool


    I am looking for ideas on how to keep the 5 gallons of water in my Jobo
CPA-2 at 68 F when the surrounding air is up to 10 degrees F warmer. I am
sure there is some simple, elegant and cheap way to do this. I would love to
hear about it.
---
I'm sure you've considered this, but in case you haven't:  why not just
standardize at the warmest ambient temperature that's common in your
darkroom?  You can heat to that temperature in the winter and not heat in
the warmest part of the year.

I'm not sure of any efficient way of keeping your water cooler without the
use of air conditioning.  I'm assuming your tap water would be over 20 C so
that's not going to help you.

In my part of Canada, I have the opposite problem:  the darkroom is never at
20 degrees.  I always have to heat it, even in the summer (it's in a
basement in an air conditioned house).  And the water out of the tap gets up
to about 13 or 14 degrees maximum, even in late summer.

I need to keep it at 68 F because of the characteristics of the combination
I am working with: Agfa APX 100 and HC-110. When I tried to use 80 F, which
I would prefer, I had to go to 1:30 dilution to get the developing time long
enough for low-contrast results. This produced a very undesirable
characteristic curve. It lost a good deal of speed, had a long toe, and
reduced highlight contrast.

At 68 F I could use Dilution B (1:7) with a feasible developing time, and
the characteristic curve was fine, short toe, good speed, no highlight
flattening. Since 68 F is the official temperature, for which most films and
developers are designed, it occurs to me that there may be other cases of
this kind, so I need to have the capability.

Take a look at some Peltier modules.  See
http://www.thermoelectric.com/2000/index.html?x=pr&p=/2000/pr
for a description of the technology.  I've see the units used in coolers
that you can plug into a vehicle's 12v system to keep things cool.  Might
be able to adapth the cooling module from one of those.  They are all
solid-state with no moving parts, etc.

I'm coming to the conclusion that you (as a group) do not include color head 
Yellow and Magenta filtration when applied seperatly to one b/w image "Split 
Filter Printing".  Is that right?

No, that's not true.  You can use the split-filter method by dialing up
each the yellow and magenta to the top (170cc in the case of Chromegas)
and making separate tests for both the same as you would if you were doing
it with MG filters.  The concept and processes are identical (and equally
unneccessary :-).

As unnecessary as it is....  why use the maximum filters (170cc with 
Chromegas)?  Wouldn't mid-range filtration (63ccY & 56ccM)  applied 
seperatly, produce an image unlike the pair of 170cc's?  Would this image not 
be unique, not as one produced solely with any M filter alone?

Hi Bruce - No, that's not correct, at least in my use of the term split
printing. The light source doesn't matter - it could be filters, it could be
a color head, it could be a variable contrast head. Regardless of the
particular source, "split printing" (at least as I always thought that term
was used) refers to the practice of making two separate  exposures of the
entire print, usually one at a relatively high contrast ( magenta with a
color head) and one at a relatively low contrast (yellow with a color head).

   Thanks Cor,
I had talked to Bostick-Sullivan several times and they just said that Rollo
Pyro and PMK were the same with Vit. c added.
 I checked again and your posted formulas are correct.
 The only problem is that it appears that the total volume and dilution are
slightly different and I'm checking to see how close they actually are. If I
have my formulas right the part A for PMK is for 500 ml and the Part A for
Rollo Pyro is for 1000 ml.{ as posted}
 I believe the EDTA is optional so if I have it right the real difference
would be in a stronger Rollo Pyro formula at the same amount.
PMK  1000ml {A}
            20g. Metol
           100g. Pyro

  The difference that I see is that the Rollo Pyro has 50g. more Pyro and
the addition of Pot. Bromide.
I wonder if just adding the Ascorbic Acid at the time of processing will
allow the PMK to be used in  the Jobo with only one developer cycle instead
of changing developers at the mid-way point? I can easily add the Pot
Bromide as I have a bottle ready at all times but have been afraid of the
Ascorbic Acid not keeping well and giving mixed results. { this from Xtol
problems that I believe are due to poor keeping properties of the ascorbic
acid in that formula}.
 Is there a form of Ascorbic Acid that has good keeping properties or a way
to store it that will keep it constant? Is this an unfounded fear on my
part?
 Any thoughts?

Trust me...I don't  :-)  But, aficianados of the practice apparently do.
The part I still don't understand about all of it is why..since one can't 
bend the laws of physics.  Perhaps it can be carried to the extreme: you
could add cyan to the mix in varying degrees, too.  Why anyone thinks the
separate application of the two filters is any different than the combined
application (for a longer exposure than either of them separately) is
beyond me.  You could actually add the cyan to introduce a ND factor and
keep your time constant.  It my take some number crunching to figure the
whole mess out, but what the heck - we're complicating the process for the
sake of complication anyway.

No.  But we're talking to the air here anyway since there is no negative
in particular under discussion.  But you have hit a critical point: let's
say a "best print" is achieved by exposing MG IV paper to 60ccY for 10
seconds and 85ccM for 15 seconds. What I'm saying is there is some value
of magenta (or yellow, if we are talking about a hard negative in a
different test) by itself that will produce an absolutely identical print
- in every way.  This is provable and has been proven.

This whole discussion is not unlike the nonsense Fred Picker got going
years ago with cold light printing.  He insisted (and had lots of
disciples preaching) that you couldn't achieve the same print from a
condensor source as with a cold light source.  Pure crap.  It's a function
of negative contrast or paper contrast.  but you can duplicate the
(tonal) results with either.  Ideally the photographer should produce a
negative optimized to the light source.  I use an Aristo cold light on my
8x10 enlarger and love the dust suppression.  OTOH I get equal qualitative
results from my Omega 4x5 machines with colorheads and from my Agfa
(professional level) 6x9cm with condensors.

Just to throw another nugget into this pot.

Since reading the messages f-stop printing, then Harry Fearn's book on B&W
printing I have been trying the following;

Meopta Mag 4 enlarger and a RH Design Analyser.

Get the suggested filter/time reading.

Stop down 2 stops and give the zero filter

Adjust to minus half stop and expose with the Analyser suggested filter

Then minus one and half stops to finish off with a five filter.

Different negatives need variations on this theme, but I am really enjoying
the darkroom these days - makes a change from swearing at Photoshop!

Sorry for the delay - I am under extreme pressure getting copies of my book

Having tried numerous film/developer combinations and settled on
Dixactol with Delta 100 (35mm) and HP5 (120) as the combinations of
choice, there are a few fine tune questions that would be helpful to
understand:

Q. What is meant by a 'water stop-bath' ?  Good old fashioned H2O with
nothing added ?

A. Right - plain water with several changes

Q. How many inversions is intended every 30 secs when developing ?  Just
one ?
A. Yes, but see below

Q. Other than being able to mix different film types in a single
development process, why would anyone want to use the two bath method ?
A. The single bath method gives slightly greater stain and slightly greater
sharpness - and I do mean slightly. It also gives closer control, for those
who want to use zone system disciplines for instance. The two bath method
gives even greater compensation, and is useful for roll film users when
there may well be varying subject brightness ranges on the same roll..
Highlights will be easier to burn in for instance, and shadow detail is
nursed up. When the developer in the highlights has been exhausted, that in
the shadows has still got energy left to keep working until there too it
finally runs out of steam. HOWEVER, since the developer was first put on the
market, I have been working away experimenting with 'stand' development.
DiXactol contains glycin which was the developing agent of choice for
'stand' development. This approach isn't usually an option with tanning and
staining developers. PMK users will be all too well aware of the need for
regular agitation.
However, I found with single bath DiXactol that if I agitated frequently
early on, I could then let the tank stand for long periods without agitation
without streaking occurring. When I did this, the adjacency effects
increased even more - the negatives are so sharp that they should have a
hazard warning notice about danger of cutting hands when handling! Also, the
compensation equals that given by the two bath method. The technique I have
settled on is continuous agitation for the first minute, then once every two
minutes (two inversions in about an 8 second period) thereafter. The lesser
agitation needs an extension of the overall development time of about 20%,
but that varies from film to film a little. I have actually extended
agitation periods to much longer than this quite successfully. I did
actually try some Pan F with no agitation after the first minute. There was
slight unevenness along the top edge, but surprisingly little. I found that
just one inversion half way through the time after the first minute's
continuous agitation got rid of this unevenness, but development times were
getting greatly extended - almost double. I'm nervous about suggesting such
long periods of 'stand' for others to use, but there is scope for fruitful
experimentation for DiXactol users with this approach.
The interesting thing with 'stand' development is that while broader areas
of highlight are well restrained, very small areas are affected by the
adjacency effects so that they actually seem to gain density relatively.
This means that there is a gleam from these tiny sections in the print to
give a bright appearance while broader areas of highlight  print easily
further down the tonal scale with no blocking up.
However, my strong advice is obviously to experiment carefully with this
approach with your own equipment, water supply and materials before
committing critical negatives to the technique.

  OK, I understand.
  The best way I've heard of is to fill one or more of the Jobo bottles
placed in the processor with ice and a little water so that the waterbath
temperature is below 68F and then the heater will bring it up to and
maintain 68F as long as there's enough ice in the bottle(s). I suppose you
could freeze bottles of water but they may split.
  With a lot of processing runs that would probably get to be a pain; some
sort of chiller may be a better way to go. I don't know anything about that.

  I think it's simply a human factor. Although I rarely use split-filter
printing every now and then I've found that it helps me hit on the right
contrast and exposure when I've gotten stuck or offtrack using a single
amount of filtration.

I have two simple DiXactol questions:

1. What type of equipment/tank is recommended when
developing 4x5 sheet film with DiXactol. It seems the
need to agitate and invert a tank prevents the use of
a tube or a Jobo type of system. What have you folks
used with success?

2. How well does it work with Tmax 100? Tmax 400?

Thanks

Hi Curt,

If you mean burning in with a single filter that's different to the filter
used for the main exposure then I agree entirely.  But that's not really
"single filter" printing since you're using at least two of them :-)    My
point really is that the two methods are alternatives, each is equally
viable, and either can be used according to taste.  It's wrong to denounce
either of them as incapable of producing the results because both can be
demonstrably proven to work.

Naturally, students will be curious as to alternatives - that's the nature
of the beast. The fundamental that they need to understand is that the
white end is set by exposure, and the black end by contrast. There are a
number of methods of achieving that end. Chris and I have done some
investiagtions into split-grade printing and been able to exactly reproduce
the paper curves obtained with single grade filters so we *know* there's
nothing different about the end result.   It's just that sometimes it's
convenient from a practical point of view to split the exposure into hard
and soft components.
>

I would respectfully suggest that it wasn't the basic method that was
wrong, but its implementation.  We sell the Heiland SplitGrade enlarger
control system which reads the density and contrast of a negative, then
computes a ratio of hard and soft exposures to produce a print perfectly
matched to the negative. It uses a motorised filter wheel with two filters,
strong Y and strong M, and does all the work for you. It can fine tune
contrast to 0.1 grade.  It works!
http://www.rhdesigns.co.uk/splitgrade.htm  I'd be the first to admit that
like any automatic exposure device it's not 100%, but it gets pretty close
unless your subject is the proverbial black cat in a coalmine  :-)

It's certainly true that many of these techniques are used as rescue
attempts, yes.  If it ain't on the negative the only way to get it onto the
print is with a paintbrush ;-)

... it is, I omit it when making the SodiumMetaBorate, else I get a a
precipitate. When making B full strength (in pure destilled water) I
always get big nice crystals eventually, so I mix up half strebgth and
use 1:4 ratio for A:B..

..soem years ago I discussed Heralds formula with Mike G., according to
him the amount of Ascorrbic acid is to low to work as a good
anti-oxidant, nevertheless the formula seems to work ago..

I once again post a message from the alt-photo list on ABC+. by Herald
Leban:

(note that this time Herald lowered the Metol conc. (from 20 g to 15
g/l) I asked him why, and he said that it didn't made any difference)

                 I have been using pyro PMK split dev. for all my film
in a JOBO but am
                 interested in the new formulation.

                 Regards,

                 Jonathon Russell<

                 Hello Jonathon and others !

                 At first I have to clear that I dont know if my
modified PMK version (I
                 call it AB C+ - Pyro) is similar to Rollo Pyro from
B&S.
                 But Im working with ABC+ Pyro since 1996 after I had
bad results in PMK on
                 my HP5+ negs. I modified the developer because 
                 the negatives showed terrible base fog and weake
impressions. The
                 relatively long developing times for N+ and N++ and the
                 resulting strong staining of PMK let me " create" my
own recepture.

                 At first I simply cut the developing times by
concentrating the stock
                 solution A with metol and pyrogallol, second by
doubling the amount of part
                 A and B in the working solution.

                 As an organic antioxidant and sub-developing reagent I
added ascorbic acid
                 (vitamin C) and for  clearing  the base fog I added a 
                 small amount of Potassiumbromid ( sorry Mr. Hutchings
but thats really
                 important).

                 I use this formula since 1996 at all my 8x10" negs for
platinum/palladium

Thanks Richard for the thorough, point-by-point response.  I agree with
everything you say here and I'm, of course, gratified to see someone else
indicating that identical results can be obtained with either a single or
split-filter method.  And I also agree that one can fine tune a little
better with the two MG filters.  Since I mostly use continuously-stepped
dichroic heads, this isn't an issue.  Where I would personally consider
using this method is with my 8x10 enlarger.  I have a V54-tubed cold light
with the boosted output 12x12 tube set.  I have so much light (typically
f/22 will print a 16x20 in 8-12 seconds!) that by using separate exposures
of the MG filters poses no exposure problems and the attendant continuous
control afforded might help in some refinement where needed.  

In the case I discussed where my partner had problems exascerbated by
split-filter printing, he was doing 60-90 second
exposures with each filter at 170cc - hitting the reciprocity curve  - and
burning up $15 bulbs like they were 4th of July firecrackers.  But
something inside him wouldn't allow him to switch to the elegantly simple
solution to print with one filter of a middling density.  He - as with
many others - indicated it wasn't possible to get both good highlights and
good shadows from one filter...until I showed him.

Regards,
Curt

In this situation, I wouldn't place my trust in ascorbate as
a remedy for rapid pyro oxidation in solutions which have a
low sulfite concentration. As a developer and reactant with
oxygen, ascorbate isn't nearly as active as pyro, so large
amounts relative to pyro would be required. That of course,
would be counterproductive since the ascorbate would reduce
silver and metol, decreasing the amount of stain produced by
pyro.

Harald Leban worked around the aerial oxidation problem
primarily by increasing the concentration of developing
agents so the development times for Pt/Pd negatives were
short compared to PMK. In his working solution, the
concentration of pyro is 3 times that of PMK; metol is 4
times the PMK level, and sulfite is double the PMK
concentrations. He used EDTA as recommended for PMK
oxidation problems, used KBr to decrease fogging (though a
small amount was used - 0.35 g/l in the working developer is
optimal) and tossed in ascorbate at a relatively low
concentration compared to pyro,

Solution A:      PMK         Leban

Metol            10 g        20 g
Bisulfite        20 g        20 g
Pyro            100 g       150 g
Ascorbate         -          10 g
EDTA              -         2.5 g
KBr               -         1.5 g
Water to make     1 L         1 L

His "B" solution is the same as PMK.

The ABC dilutions are different:

PMK: 1 + 2 + 100    Leban: 2 + 4 + 100


Working solution composition (g/l):
                 PMK           Leban
Metol            0.097 g       0.37 g
Bisulfite        0.194 g       0.37 g
Pyro             0.97  g       2.83 g
Ascorbate         -            0.19 g
EDTA              -            0.05 g
KBr               -            0.03 g
Metaborate       5.825 g      11.32 g

A couple of things should be apparent. The metol and pyro
concentrations have increased 4X and 3X, and bisulfite 2X,
with only a 2X increase in metaborate which is required for
neutralization. Using a dilution of 2 + 6 + 100 or 2 + 8 +
100 may result in greater activity and staining. If times
are too short, I'd add water. If fog is a problem, KBr in
"A" can be increased 5X to 10X to get it up to the levels
required for optimal suppression. If staining vs silver
development is less than PMK, consider cutting the bisulfite
level in Leban's "A" to 10 g/l, leaving out the ascorbate,
and storing small quanitities in glass bottles to avoid
oxidation.

Anyway, those are my thoughts about the "rollo" problem,
which doesn't affect me, since I'd never use pyro in a
tube processor.

I,ve been using DiXactol for some time now and have changed from dish
development to using the Combitank at barrys suggestion.
The Combitank allows inversion development and although it has its qirks ( I
will advise these direct if you go for one if you e-mail me) it works well.
I use Tmax400 at 320ASA as my main film and Tmax100 when I want longer
exposures-both as 5 x 4 format--what else is there!!

regards

JR

Can anyone suggest a film / developer combination which generates lots of

Preferably whilst retaining film speed. I hear that Rodinal may be good for
this but I'm not sure.

Rob
By now you will probably have lots of advice on this one. May I add my
belated contribution.
What you don't need is the high contrast neg with the unprintable highlights
you get with the usual advice to take a fast film like TMZ and push process
it in coarse developer - sometimes print developer is advised. This means
you then have to use a soft paper which lowers grain effect and gives it a
more mushy look, while highlights are still blocked.
Aim for a very flat negative by using an ultra fast film - Neopan 1600 gives
the sharpest grain - then expose it generously at around EI 650. Pull
process it in a non-solvent developer. Rodinal is OK and is readily
available (try 6 minutes @ 1:50 dilution), but mixing your own FX1 is even
better (start experiments at 14 minutes). You can use print developers at
triple dilution too, but avoid warm tone developers which will rush up and
block highlights before shadows reach good density. Ilford PQ Universal is a
good choice @ 1:29.
Then print on an ultra hard paper such as Multigrade filtered for grade 5.
This should then give you fully graduated images, including highlight
graduation, with critically sharp BIG grain. You will need to adjust neg
development times to get just the right negative density range to print with
correct tonal range on the hard paper.
All this is pretty common knowledge - though it is amazing how often the
advice to push process a fast film for prominent grain is still regularly
repeated in consumer photo mags. in the UK.
However, the really important step is rarely mentioned. That is to print
with a point source enlarger. Actually, these are very rare and very fussy
to print with. So use the dodge outlined in my latest book (quick commercial
plug there!) to adapt normal condenser lighting. This means you mask down
the original light in a standard condenser set-up by using a disc inserted
in the lamphouse with the smallest hole in the centre that will act without
vignetting showing. The best way is to cut a hole in the mask the same shape
as the negative format. You may need to step up the power of the bulb to
compensate light loss. Alternatively, you can just substitute a smaller
bulb. I would still use an opal bulb, but you can also usually mock up a
transformer and car headlight or sidelight bulb, say.
Using a grain magnifier on an enlarger set up like this is fun. You get to
choose which LAYER of the emulsion you focus on! The grain will look like
sandpaper.

First, I'd like thank everyone who responded to post regarding C-41 BW film.
The information and opinions were very helpful.  Now I'd like to pose
another
question, this time on split filter printing.  I recently read Joe
Englander's
1995 article on the subject, but I found that the procedure he used,
particularly using a JOBO testprinter, rather vague.  I think I have the
steps
down so you develop half the exposure for the low contrast then rotate the
testprinter and develop for the rest of the exposureusing different filter
settings, but I'm not sure how to read the results.  Does anyone have any
experience with this technique?

David,
You are walking into a lion's dens with this one. Along with f stop
printing, this is a topic seems to attract supporters (or opposers!) with an
evangelic streak. Generally speaking using a single basic grade exposure
with burning in at varying other grades is a quicker and more effective, I
believe, than split grading as a standard approach. Note: you do NOT get any
extra tones of any kind with split grading than with single filter basic
exposure no matter what zealots claim. And claim or imply it they regularly
do.
However, there are some occasions where split grading can be a specific
help - this is where you need to dodge a specific area of the negative
during either the soft or the hard exposure only. Such prints are not
common, but when they do occur split grading is a big help. Note that you
can get just the same effect by holding back the negative area in a single
filter exposure technique, then burning it in with a different grade filter,
but dodging during the split grade approach is generally easier to control.
The Joe England Jobo test printer approach simply gives a matrix of a
complete range of contrast grades and exposure on one sheet of paper. It
seems a good idea, but I find that the areas in each section of the matrix
are usually too small to give meaningful information. Separate test strips
work better for me.

Bob
Sorry, but it DOESN'T reduce the amount of dodging and burning. The dodging
and burning is EXACTLY the same as with single filter basic exposure. If you
have an extreme density range negative, you are going to be working at the
softest paper grade anyway.
It is true to say that there may be some negatives where CONTROL of dodging
is easier to control where you can dodge different negative areas during
differing filter exposures. Sorry if this sounds like nit-picking, but it's
all part of this mystique and folklore that has been building up around
split grade printing.

I'm not sure where you guys are located but in the UK it can be obtained
from Nova who have their own website. A search should find it as I cannot
remember the address.
In the States according to the leaflet with my Combitank it is supplied/made
by HP Marketing Corp,16 Chapin Road,Pine Brook,N.J. 07058 Tel: (201)

Thanks Barry,
You will be pleased to hear that Edge of Darkness was on my Christmas List but I will have to wait to find out whether Santa  has obliged!  A point source enlarger head will have to wait (several years, they are very expensive for my enlarger!).

While the grain conversation is happening, I'll slip in a little side 
question. My mother is looking for a film that resembles the old HP4 film as 
much as possible. Remember the 70's..? Lots of grain and truly BLACK and 
WHITE photography (nothing in between!). I've bought her a roll of 35mm 
t-max 3200, as this seems to be the closest to what she needs, but have the 
feeling it won't satisfy her retro/graphic requirements... Suggestions 
please, from a frustrated daughter...! Despite ideas like developing in 
paper dev, printing on filter 5 (through a point source enlarger of course) 
and some ruthless cropping, she still wants her old HP4!! Or close enough to 
it...

Thanks (from both of us!)

I am not a proponent of split filter printing as my previous contributions
indicate, and I make a big point in my various writings and workshops of my
catch phrase "you can't make a fine print from a coarse negative". So you
can see that I am in absolute agreement with you on the negative issue.
HOWEVER, if you do commercial printing for other photographers, as I do for
a living, then you get used to the most dreadful negatives coming through
the door from which a good print has to be made somehow (and AREN'T the
erring photographers resistant to even the most tactful and diplomatic
coaching and correction of negative exposure and development technique).
In these circumstances, there are occasions where the ability to dodge in
different areas during the different filter exposures is a help - if only
because it gives a little more time for intricate work. However, burning in
during each of the split filter exposures has no advantage at all. You can
always burn in with differing filters after a basic single filter exposure.
When tackled on these issue the evangelical split filter printers start
back-peddling and saying things like split filter printing is just 'one more
tool in the tool box', but the fact is that on the workshop circuit I
encounter hundreds of keen photographers who have listened to all this stuff
expounded by preceding printing gurus, and they honestly believe that there
are magical properties to the technique - that certain grey tones are
revealed in the paper emulsion that single filter printing somehow leaves
hidden.
And a personal pet hate - they also seem to think that skies must be burned
in on the soft filter exposure. Ugh! - flat, grey muddy clouds!

Richard -

It simply isn't so.  There is no local contrast problem or correction that
can't be made with a single filter.  Where a benefit does accrue for the
continuous aspect of contrast control WRT variable contrast split-filter
printing is in the use of MG filters.  While I use these with students,
for personal work i typically use yellow or magenta in my colorheads which
gives a totally continuous range as you mention.  With my 8x10 enlarger, I
use some of both - I use a yellow to put my light source where I want it
relative to my 4x5 lights (Aristo v54 in the 8x10 and Chromega heads on
the 4x5s) - then use MG filters to get the contrast I need for my print.

Fred Picker was a strong proponent of the split-filter printing method.
He was also a proponent of exposing a print in 2 (or 5?) second "bursts"
of light.  He also made all means of criticism of condenser light and
touted cold light in its place.  Most of this stuff is pure nonesense.
The problem many of us face is when we try to teach fundamentals to our
students and they come to us with these notions and we need to get them
back on track with the fundamentals.  It saves paper and hair-pulling in
the long run.

One little aside here: why aren't people doing something to correct these
negatives which they believe necessitates split-filter printing?  Why
aren't they either using PMK or masking to make a better negative that
will yield a superb print without the chenanigans.  PMK can even be used
in a bleach/redevelop of bad negatives.  These solutions go a lot further
towards achieving perfection in the print...and those who know my work
know my demands for perfection in printing.

Curt

... it is, I omit it when making the SodiumMetaBorate, else I get a a
precipitate. When making B full strength (in pure destilled water) I
always get big nice crystals eventually, so I mix up half strebgth and
use 1:4 ratio for A:B..

I am glad somebody else has the problem with B bath mixing in PMK. I have
always used distilled water, and have never been able to get the total
amount of Kodalk dissolved as per the formula. I have even tried filtering
the distilled water to see if there were actually any solids present (there
weren't of course) and I boiled and cooled it to drive off oxygen too.
I just gave up and use double the amount of water as you do.
Has anybody else succeeded in dissolving the sodium metaborate as shown in
the 'official' formula?
Incidentally, it is interesting to note that a commercial company selling
what claims to be PMK in the UK works at 1:2:50. They obviously solve the
problem another way that saves on the expensive constituent - pyro.

It works really nicely with TMY, and is especially good with TMX where it
adds the edge sharpness that isn't as apparent with T-grain films as
conventional emulsions, and restrains those armour plated highlights.
I don't recommend the developer with rotary processors. They are more prone
to aerial oxidisation, but the main reason is the loss of those valuable
adjacency effects. . You can process easily in a tray, but my recommendation
every time is to use the Combi tank which allows inversion agitation and the
use of the partial 'stand' technique with the single bath option. You will
find this info on my website www.barrythornton.com.
Incidentally, the adjacency effects are not just a matter of edge
sharpness - very small areas of highlight detail develop to a greater
density than broader expanses of highlight. This can be a very valuable
effect in adding gleam to those minute highlights in a print where paper
base white is acceptable.

Naturally, students will be curious as to alternatives - that's the nature
of the beast. The fundamental that they need to understand is that the
white end is set by exposure, and the black end by contrast. There are a
number of methods of achieving that end. Chris and I have done some
investigations into split-grade printing and been able to exactly reproduce
the paper curves obtained with single grade filters so we *know* there's
nothing different about the end result.   It's just that sometimes it's
convenient from a practical point of view to split the exposure into hard
and soft components.
>

The trouble is that many of the workshop participants I address believe that
split filter printing provides them with tones that single filter printing
won't. I have actually stood at the back of several classes with a UK
seminar lecturer and heard him actually say this several times on different
occasions.


>He'd been doing this
>split-filter routine for years - learned in his MFA work.  He talked the

I would respectfully suggest that it wasn't the basic method that was
wrong, but its implementation.  We sell the Heiland Split Grade enlarger
control system which reads the density and contrast of a negative, then
computes a ratio of hard and soft exposures to produce a print perfectly
matched to the negative. It uses a motorised filter wheel with two filters,
strong Y and strong M, and does all the work for you. It can fine tune
contrast to 0.1 grade.  It works!
http://www.rhdesigns.co.uk/splitgrade.htm  I'd be the first to admit that
like any automatic exposure device it's not 100%, but it gets pretty close
unless your subject is the proverbial black cat in a coalmine  :-)
>

The trouble with all enlarger metering devices, split or single filter
exposure, is that they assess over all density ranges. When we actually make
a print, we often prefer the appearance of one on a 'wrong' grade when
compared to the negative's density range, which we then 'correct' by
selective dodging and burning - usually using a slightly harder grade of
paper.
It 's a great generalisation with plenty of exceptions, but I believe I am
finding superior print quality by producing a slightly flat negative with
full exposure and printing on a slightly harder grade of paper. The local
contrast is higher, but the thin highlights allow relatively easy burning
in. I do have to be adept at dodging shadows though.
The general trend with split graders seems to be the opposite i.e. a gutsy
negative printed on what would, with single filter printing, be a softer
grade. Again this is a great generalisation, but it might explain why devout
split graders swear by the process so much - their negatives are more
difficult to print by the single filter exposure technique.
As a more general comment i.e. not just on the split filter printing debate,
I wonder what you guys feel out there about the use of 'grade' 2 (I know
that is difficult to describe in these VC days) as a 'normal' - the print
grade defining the negative density we should aim at. I am more and more
wondering whether 'grade' 3 isn't the one we should aim at? Maybe that
should vary by neg format?


>One little aside here: why aren't people doing something to correct these
>negatives which they believe necessitates split-filter printing?

They're the same type of people who buy a new pair of speakers to "improve"
their hi-fi instead of addressing the signal source!

Lovely analogy Richard. Is it all right if I pinch that to use in my
workshops? I'll give an attribution. I suppose the same applies to people
who constantly go out and buy 'better' lenses, but expose and process
dreadful negatives.

>  Why
>aren't they either using PMK or masking to make a better negative that

It's certainly true that many of these techniques are used as rescue
attempts, yes.  If it ain't on the negative the only way to get it onto the
print is with a paintbrush ;-)


Or an ultra soft pencil on the negative, which is an excellent way to cheat!

Just to throw another nugget into this pot.

Since reading the messages f-stop printing, then Harry Fearn's book on B&W
printing I have been trying the following;

Meopta Mag 4 enlarger and a RH Design Analyser.

Get the suggested filter/time reading.

Stop down 2 stops and give the zero filter

Adjust to minus half stop and expose with the Analyser suggested filter

Then minus one and half stops to finish off with a five filter.

Different negatives need variations on this theme, but I am really enjoying
the darkroom these days - makes a change from swearing at Photoshop!


Geoff
Why do you do this Geoff instead of taking a straight reading and exposing
at the single filter indicated? Wouldn't that be simpler and quicker? What
advantage do you gain by all this?

Trust me...I don't  :-)  But, aficianados of the practice apparently do.
The part I still don't understand about all of it is why..since one can't
bend the laws of physics.  Perhaps it can be carried to the extreme: you
could add cyan to the mix in varying degrees, too.  Why anyone thinks the
separate application of the two filters is any different than the combined
application (for a longer exposure than either of them separately) is
beyond me.  You could actually add the cyan to introduce a ND factor and
keep your time constant.  It my take some number crunching to figure the
whole mess out, but what the heck - we're complicating the process for the
sake of complication anyway.

No.  But we're talking to the air here anyway since there is no negative
in particular under discussion.  But you have hit a critical point: let's
say a "best print" is achieved by exposing MG IV paper to 60ccY for 10
seconds and 85ccM for 15 seconds. What I'm saying is there is some value
of magenta (or yellow, if we are talking about a hard negative in a
different test) by itself that will produce an absolutely identical print
- in every way.  This is provable and has been proven.

This whole discussion is not unlike the nonsense Fred Picker got going
years ago with cold light printing.  He insisted (and had lots of
disciples preaching) that you couldn't achieve the same print from a
condensor source as with a cold light source.  Pure crap.  It's a function
of negative contrast or paper contrast.  but you can duplicate the
(tonal) results with either.  Ideally the photographer should produce a
negative optimized to the light source.  I use an Aristo cold light on my
8x10 enlarger and love the dust suppression.  OTOH I get equal qualitative
results from my Omega 4x5 machines with colorheads and from my Agfa
(professional level) 6x9cm with condensors.

Right on Curt!

Its made by MPH in Sweden, but here in the Uk you can get it from many
sources. One good one is Nova, the makers of the vertical print processing
tanks. They are on www.novadarkroom.com
Barry Thornton



Who makes the Combitank?

Hi Rob
I'll have a word with Santa. The important point is that you can get an
effect that is half way between double condenser /opal bulb and point source
(which is too fussy anyway most of the time), by cutting a mask and putting
it into the lamphouse. If you are careful about heat risk, you can cut this
out of cardboard - perhaps even out of the packaging of Edge of Darkness?

Regards
Barry

Thanks Barry,
You will be pleased to hear that Edge of Darkness was on my Christmas List
but I will have to wait to find out whether Santa  has obliged!  A point
source enlarger head will have to wait (several years, they are very
expensive for my enlarger!).

I have not yet seen Barry's idea of point source enlarging; I too am waiting
for Santa Claus to bring the book! He is obviously having problems with his
reindeer! However, I printed this way by adapting my Gnome Alfa II universal
enlarger back in the seventies.  An easy way to try this out is to drill a
1/4" hole in the bottom of a suitable size tin can, cut three tags in the
sidewall of the can and fit over the enlarging bulb using the bent tags to
clip over the bulb.
A point that Barry omitted in his posting that I found necessary, is to
increase the height of the lamp house by fitting a 2 1/2" sheet metal spacing
ring, to allow sufficient adjustment of the lamp to get even illumination on
the base board. Having said this, it could be argued that what I have
described is not a true point source, but it is near enough for practical
purposes.

For really good grain, develop the film (preferably 400ASA) in a Monobath
developer. I don't know if proprietary monobath developers are available
these days, but I used the FX6a formula taken from the British Journal of
Photography Annual 1964. This gives excellent, crisp grain that is further
enhanced by a point source enlarger. Later editions of the BJP Annual quote
the FX-16 (grain effects on high speed films) formula. I have not tried it,
but it would be worth a try.  Another way of getting very effective grain
effects is to print a normally processed  negative sandwiched with a grain
screen.

I'm taking this off list because this discussion has gone on way too 
long, and seems to have more to do with an unfortunate experience 
that Curt had with an inept associate than anything else. [1]

>
>When tackled on these issue the evangelical split filter printers start
>back-peddling and saying things like split filter printing is just 'one more
>tool in the tool box',

I take some exception here, since I'm the one who made the "toolbox" 
comment. First of all, I'm in no sense a split filter "evangelist", 
and I would never argue that it should be taught as a primary 
technique. However, for those of use without access to Color- or 
VC-heads, it does provide a level of control that we would not 
otherwise have.

>
>And a personal pet hate - they also seem to think that skies must be burned
>in on the soft filter exposure. Ugh! - flat, grey muddy clouds!

No argument there.

-t

[1] though I have to admit that the guy claimed that split printing 
was a substitute for burning and dodging -- and was thus a good thing 
because B & D was hard to learn -- certainly stirred things up.

Dan,
         Surely you have no junkies in the land of Morman!  On that note, 
the reason I am writing is that I have been informed that sometime in Jan, 
I will have to come to SLC for about a week to do an installation.  Is 
there any chance that we could meet face to face and maybe have dinner or 
drinks?  It would be on me of course.  I don't know the dates yet as the 
machines have not been shipped yet.  What do you think?

True with one exception - ours!  The Analyser and ZoneMaster uniquely allow
you to preview the effects of printing at the "wrong" grade.

"Grade" is arbitrary really - one manufacturer's grade 2 is another grade 3
(eg Agfa vs Ilford). ISO(R) contrast range is the only useful measure of
paper contrast because it defines the effective negative density range that
the paper can reproduce. An ISO(R) figure of around 100 is "normal". Unless
you're specifically aiming to print on a fixed grade paper there really
isn't any need to worry *too* much about negative density so long as it's
somewhere near the middle of the range so that you can adjust the paper
contrast either way when printing.  Negs that require a "grade 5" or a
"grade 0" to print are the problem ones - you're up against an end stop.

You're welcome to use it on one condition - you stop telling your students
that f-stop printing is a waste of time ;-)

So many people believe that if they throw money at their photography it's
bound to improve it.  Not necessarily.  Obviously if you have poor
equipment you'll never get fine results, but as Bert Hardy proved with his
famous box camera photo - the most important thing in photography is what's
behind the viewfinder!

Cue a lengthy discussion on the relative grain structure of different
pencil leads .... :-)

Hello there! 

I am afraid Im just one of them lurkers not contributing in any way
to the interests of the list, but still curious in some topics discussed:
For instance, why was the EL Nikkor 2,8/50 even mentioned in the survey
of enlarger lenses? I have one on hopefully permanent loan and it out-
performed everything discussed so far,excluding a 50 mm Focotar I
borrowed just for comparison (the bastard woulnt sell it for any
price). I made the tests making 10 & 20+ enlargements on film instead
of paper and examiined the prints with a 10-100+ microscope, so Im
pretty conviinced about definition with no critical info about contrast
etc. Uh, I shold confess I did not get a Meogon for comparison, but the
Anaret I foolishly purchased relying in 'tests published here in the
backwaters of civilization was slihtly, but clearly inferior. My own
Focotar/5 cm(!) was the worst of the pack. I suspect that the 5 cm
instead of 50 mm indicates an earlier, inferior construction. Any
comments? Anybody willing to sell a more recent Focotar?

Barry,
The real problem is that I have a colour diffusion head on my enlarger so until I get a condenser head I will not be able to obtain the emphasised / sharpness of grain you are referring too.  In the mean time I will put in a late (and wishful thinking) addition to my Christmas list!   

Where can I find more info on FX1 ?

Er,sorry checking again the list I notice Nikkors were mentioned and
also that everything is ok. at f8. Sorry, aint true in my case,not
in terms of definition, anyway. I made my quite exhaustive tests using
three similar apertures for each lens. I agree f 2.8 is merely usable
for quick focusing ( assuming there is no focus shift ). Sorry about
all the probable blunders; I am the lousiest of typists and probably
lousy with my English. To get one up on me some of you might try coupla
words in Finnish instead of those chic quotes in French I dont comprehend.

All,
         This list has become a spam venue for the English.  I wish if they 
want to advertise their darkroom products and chemistry they would take out 
paid for ads.  Enough is enough.

More than pissed off than usual,
Lee Carmichael

The "film developing cookbook" that this is associated

Normally I hate to send "me too's', but in this case I strongly agree
with Richard (and obviously not with Lee). I personally feel that Barry
and Richard (Ross) (almost) only talk about their products when
specificly asked for. I do not mind, and I find the generous amount of
info/feedback they both give far outnumbers the occasional mentioning of
their products (and yes: I am a very happy user of a Fstop timer, no
shares at Richards company though..)

Best & peace,

Cor (dutch)

I think the person who maintains this list certainly has the ultimiate say
on this. But until he speaks, and FWIW, I agree. I very much appreciate the
information provided by several of the people who promote their books and
products on this list. However providing helpful  information isn't a
license to also promote your commercial products IMHO. Please guys, if you
want to participate in the list, great, but in the spirit of lists of this
type put the commercials somewhere else.

Actually, I quite agree.  Normally I try to only mention specific products
in response to a specific discussion but in a recent posting about
splitgrade printing I got carried away and it does look like a blatant
advert for which I apologise.  Ironically, I can't sell that particular
product in the US anyway as the manufacturer has his own US distributor!

I'll keep a better check on my enthusiasm in future :-)

Regards
Richard

Like Curt (see below) I find f stop printing so intuitive (although I was
very resistant to it when Gene Nocon first introduced me to it back in the
days of the first f stop timer) that I would hate to go back to an
'ordinary' timer now.
My Bowens version is starting to play up and so I plan to switch over to one
of Richard's which I am very familiar with - the point I'm coming to is that
raised by Curt about multiple enlargers. Surely (Richard??) it must be
possible to have a simple switching system to control several enlargers from
one timer rather than have as Curt suggests four (in his case) timers? I
have long ago set up a system in my darkroom to do this with white light for
flashing paper with or without exposure through the negative in any enlarger
all controlled by one timer. I have also trialled the Heiland split grade
head which meant I needed to set up a cross connecting system to be able to
hop between timers and enlargers. It was a pretty clumsy jumble as electrics
are not so inuitive to me (!) but it worked. I can't see any reason why a
sleek switching system could not easily be made to fit the bill here?
Perhaps there is a need for such a product as a button-on 'extra'?

Yes, Juhani, the Nikkor I tested was indeed the EL 2.8/50, the one I now
use, but the first specimen I tried was rejected and almost put me off
trying the second!  Interestingly your findings do confirm the worst
performing lens in my test, where all was not sweetness and Leitz!  It is
generally true that the optimum aperture for an enlarging lens is two stops
down. Going further introduces diffraction into the equation. When saying
that f8 was a leveller in my test, I was certainly not claiming that all
were at their optimum at that stop; as you have found with your Nikkor EL.
I have no experience with the latest Focotars, which I am sure are excellent
:-)

Clifford.

Lee, be careful with your 'English', the people you refer to are British :-)
If what they introduce is Spam, then I prefer it to roast beef!  The
contribution these folk make to the list is invaluable and would be sorely
missed.  As a confirmed f-stop printer I do not own any of the products, the
mention of which seem to irritate you, but nevertheless look forward to
Richard's contribution to all the many subjects he has commented on.

Actually, if you take a look at our charter, I specifically *allow*
commercial messages, so long as they are short and sweet and not
overly repeated...  Richard, you were thus not 'out of bounds'.

It is important to leave room for responsible commercial traffic.
This is a small community with a similarly small community of
vendors - we need to support them to keep this B&W alive and healthy.

If the commercial traffic becomes excessive, I'll step in and let the
offender know (nicely)...

Yes, it would be a fairly simple matter wiring-wise - just a 4-way
extension socket with each socket individually switched for example, or a
big rotary switch which simply selects any one enlarger.  If there's
sufficient interest I could look into it.  Depending on how your darkroom's
arranged though I would have thought a bigger problem is being able to
reach one timer from any of four enlargers!

Richard

why?  usually in the discourse of conversation and debate, opinions 
are not always shared by all.  if you find this list informative and

Well done John. Yes the Queen is British, But I know there are at least
three Welshman on the list, two Scots, and there must be one or two English
out there!  and I was concerned that those not born in England may be
offended and leave the list.:-)

Thnaks CLifford. There's a great deal to learn on this list and little of it
relies on where you are or what nationality you have. I think I can bring us
back to the subject in hand rather neatly. When I realised  Barry Thornton
reads/writes on this list I wrote to him to ask a question about his
DiXactol and landscape photography. He answered, I tried his developer and I
ahve to say the results were very encouraging. Rather than Barry and Richard
simply puffing their products, I reckon to have learned a great deal from
the expertise of those two and other working photographers/printers talking
about themselves and their work and yes, even the products they sell. There
are other posters here with similar expertise you can tap in to. We all know
who they are and I for one really enjoy their posts.Wouldn't it be grat if
Agfa and Ilford and Kodak could openly put up one of their staff experts for
a bit of brain picking?
All the best
jm.

Thanks Richard,
Just my luck that the one formula I was interested in was the one which was wrong!
I have now done a search on FX1and found a very useful site on all things chemical for B&W.

As do I.  But I also never saw this as spam. I hate internet ads in my face
as much as the next guy, but this didn't appear commercial to me, just
responsive to the questions. As a relative neophyte, I came here for a
source of info that's precious hard to find. I support Ilford (English)
because they made a commitment back when it mattered and I therefore expect
them to be one of the last to bail out. I subscribe to an English magazine
(shameless plug: Camera and Darkroom) because there are no photography
magazines published in my country any more (US). I'm grateful for these
English contributors because they help me understand what I'm trying to do.
If England is going to become the home of B&W by default, I can stand a
little discussion of the products they are vending.

Rob,

An alternative thought on emphasising enlarged grain... have you considered
making "enlarged" negatives on line/lith film? OK, you lose intermediate
grey tones, but the graphic effects of purely "granular" black-and-white
images could be what you are looking for. An excellent book (out-of-print
some years ago but can still be found in s/h bookstores, e-Bay, etc) is
"Photo Graphics - Line and Contrast Methods" by Par Lundqvist, 1972, Focal
Press, ISBN 240 50771.1 and which cost 2.50 originally.

BTW: Par Lundqvist authored a companion volume "Colour Graphics" ISBN 0 240
51046 1

Ever heard of B&W Magazine?  Published out of Santa Barbara, it is a 
good magazine, although it does deal a lot more with collecting than 
photo techniques.  However the quality is very good and there is even 
a large section for photographers to advertise (shudder) ther work.

hey everyone,

well its that time of year again and time for me to unsubscribe for a 
while (WOW!!! I've done this 3 times this year...must be a record for 
vacations or something).
The looooooong thread on split filter printing seems both interesting 
and overheated, and I plan to read them all (haven't had time yet) 
when i return and  finally set the record straight with my all 
knowing knowledge, so be ready...you have been warned!   ;-)

Hope you all have a safe and happy holidays, santa brings you want 
you want, and the list is still together when i get back.


Peace

Alexis Neel

As a more general comment i.e. not just on the split filter printing debate,
I wonder what you guys feel out there about the use of 'grade' 2 (I know
that is difficult to describe in these VC days) as a 'normal' - the print
grade defining the negative density we should aim at. I am more and more
wondering whether 'grade' 3 isn't the one we should aim at? Maybe that
should vary by neg format?

Barry

When I was working commercialy back in the 1960's I printed almost 
exclusively on Kodak bromide or bromesko and made my negatives to print on 
grade 2. After quite a long lay off during the 1970's and 80's, I began 
seriously again  around 1989/90. When printing now on VC paper I find that 
the negatives I am making require grade 3 or 3.5 . With graded paper the same 
negatives print on grade 2 Jessops paper and grade 2 Ilfobrom gallery, but 
prints on Oriental seagul grade 2 and Forte museum grade 2 seem to be a 
little soft, probably by about 1/2 grade in VC terms.

When I first used DIXactol last year some of my first negatives on HP5 in two 
solution were very soft. but I have recently been pleasantly surprised at how 
well they look when printed Agfa MC Classic at grade 5.

Yes, Alexis, they sent their information and it appeared as you say to be off
the subject of craft, more of appreciation.  Thanks.

Anyone in England suggest a source for 10x8 mounting tissue? Silverprint
don't have any and don't know when they're getting any, which has left me
baffled. And for those who think this isn't a high faluting enough question
for this list - sorry.

Thanks for the tip, Tim, I'll pick up a copy with an eye toward subscribing.
I visited their website (and bookmarked; will take some time to absorb the
galleries).  I like their attituide, quality seems to matter.  They also have
a digital magazine, recognizing that digital is different and deserves its own
publication to avoid, in their words, being unfair to those who don't share
the interest in the medium.  Would that the former photography magazines in
this country had that kind of integrity.

As a relative novice, by comparison with some on this list, I would like to add my opinion to this thread. Please enlighten me if I am wrong.
When I was learning how to print on VC paper I had a problem understanding why we were told not to use the paper manufacturers recommended dichroic filter settings for the type of enlarger we were printing on.  In the pursuit of understanding and being a bit of a techie I bought a set of Ilford Multigrade filters, a densitometer and a transmission step wedge. Then, using Ilford Delta 100 and Ilford MG IV FB I did a series of Zone system tests. 

1. Using EI 100 developed in ID11 stock  8.5 mins 20deg C  exactly as per Ilfords recomendation I produced 11 negatives (Zone 0 thru X).  I then printed those 11 negs using Ilfords recommended dichroic filter settings for Grade 2 on my enlarger (the same print time for each of them). 
These prints showed me exactly what I wanted, i.e. Zone zero was Max Black(almost) and Zone X was paper base white with all the intermediate Zones printing as expected.   
Why had I been told that I could expect my personal film speed to be only around EI 50 when I could use EI 100 and produce what we were told we were aiming for? 

2.  I then did personal fim speed tests using Perceptol and arrived at EI 40,  1+3 @ 24deg C  8.5 mins. Again I produced my 11 negs but this time I was using Ilford Multigrade filters (Grade 2) for the print tests. This produced almost exactly the same results as the first set of tests when printed.

The main difference was that the neg density range of test 1 was 1.5 LogD and for test 2 the LogD was 1.1.
Of course I was using different filtration. So using different filtration I needed a different density range.
I confirmed this by printing my transmission step wedge firstly with the dichroic filter(G2) settings and then with the Ilford MG Filter (G2) using the same time.

So why go for a slower personal film speed?
I then did some print tests on ilford graded paper and yes the LogD 1.1 negs printed well on a Grade 2 paper while the LogD 1.5 negs did not.

So why have I gone through all this explanation. The answer is that I wonder why nobody ever says that if you are going to print only on VC paper, then use the film and paper manufacturers recommended development and filter settings as your starting point and not AA's indication that a much lower film speed is correct.  Things have moved on since then. Also why are we not told that the benefit of a softer (LogD 1.1) neg is that it will print on Graded papers much better. Also why are we not told that by using Ilford MG G2 filter for our calibration of film development we will arrive at neg density which will print well on both VC and Graded papers providing you use Ilford MG filters for the VC printing.

I have read books which tell you that the manufacturers recommended dichroic filter settings are not what is required and then they provide an alternative set of settings. But not one them explains why or how they arrived at those alternative settings.
It occurs to me that using a colour analyser it should be possible to calibrate a colour dichroic head to match Ilford MG filters. I have not seen this recommended anywhere but then I have not read that widely on the subject.

Finally in response to Barry's thoughts on developing the neg to suit a Grade 2 or 3 paper. This is meaningless unless qualified by either  the graded paper make or VC paper make and the enlarger filtration settings or filters being used.  Also can we be sure that because your enlager says it uses for example CC dichroic measurements that it is accurate. One mans Grade 2 may be another mans Grade 3.

I apologise for using solely Ilford as my examples but thats what I use. I am sure these arguments are equally valid for other filter sets and papers.

In reference to the quoted paragraph below:

I am interested in how you produced these 11 negatives, exactly one zone 
apart from each other?  Are we to assume they were exposed exactly one 
f-stop apart for each negative? If so, I doubt they were one zone apart as 
there is no film that I am aware ( and certainly no Ilford film) that has a 
perfectly linear characteristic curve when exposed and developed "normally".

I was referring to the exposure being one zone (or stop ) apart and not the neg density for each exposure being one zone apart.

John, it's listed in the "UK section" of the Calumet web site
www.calumetphoto.com  They have Seal tissues. A pack of 100 sheet 10x8
archival dry mount tissue, low temp is 23.95 and  a pack of 25 sheet 10x8
low temp for RC colour/B&W is 6.95. You enter the UK priced section
of the web site by clicking on the "Shop now" panel and then the UK flag.
You can buy on line if you register first or freephone 08000 96 43 96.
They are based in Milton Keynes with branches around the UK.

Rob, was this a free range greeting?  Or as they say in Okie: "Have a good

  A long time ago, back when negs were tiny and grain was huge <g> I
learned to develop a little less and print on grade 3 (graded paper) as
"normal." Of course developing a little less meant that a little more
exposure was needed too.
  The result was slightly finer grain, slighter higher sharpness, and lots
of shadow density which made it easier to produce a brilliant print. With
35mm film any reduction in grain and increase in sharpness was pretty
important.
  With modern films there's less need for such things but I find that
aiming toward printing with 25M to 40M still gives somewhat better quality.
  Unfortunately with VC paper the grades are moving targets; the specified
grade 2 of Ilford MG Warmtone fiber is about a grade, or roughly 20M-30M,
lower in contrast than grade 2 of the ordinary MG fiber.

My experience with getting the "proper" negative to make a beautiful 
expressive print has been that it's easy to make  a 35mm negative the 
prints "correctly" on grade 3 paper and it is easy to do the same for a 
large format 4x5 negative that prints "correctly" grade 2 paper because 
of the lower base plus fog of the large format negative-it is essentially 
"clearer".
As for manufacturer's recommendations about exposure and development- yes 
their recommendations produce reasonably nice negatives, but  slightly 
more exposure and slightly less development is where that "beautifully 
expressive" idea comes in to play.

To be perfectly honest, I've been using a couple of these timers in my
darkroom for years.  I even tray develop HP5+ about 2 feet from one of
them with no apparent fogging.  Is this really an issue?  I've never
actually tested for fogging myself.

Paper is graded for a contrast range and speed.

Inside each box of paper comes a specifications sheet; and you can find
these specs in the contento of most of the products' brochures.

The ISO that applies to paper can be seen as a comparative value, so one
paper you are familiar with is then forseen as faster or slower than the new
one you may wish to try.

The R number is the contrast range (r=range, get it?) Grade one is from 100
to 120, G 2 from 110 to 95, G 3 from 90 to 65 G4 from 65 to 45 G5, if you
can find any is usually from 40 to 38 or 25.

This denotes the gama curve or range of grey in the scale; warmtone paper is
made with more silver chloride, a return of the 'soft' or more grey tones
that we associate with the 'cold toned' or darker papers on the market,
today.

The older and today's portrait papers that are mostly all silver chloride
paper are very long range, wonderful in detail papers.

Printing on Grade two places your first try right in the middle and allows
you to go up or down from there.

More?

Those things seemed to be too bright, I've never trusted them, I mean if I
can see by the light of the timer .... instead I use a Gralab 900.With it I
can turn the display off The best processing timer I ever used was my
Heathkit digital darkroom timer, unfortunately it died last summer and I
don't know where to get spare chips.

Is anyone familiar with that old timer and know where I may get replacment
electronics?

Thanks,

Don Bryant

Hello List,
If someone could email me a phone number or email for Patrick Alt, the man 
who refurbish/redo/fix etc... large format cameras, I would really 
appreciate.
I know... pure-silver is about black and white, but I swear I use my 
cameras only for black and white photography :-)
Thank you.

Actually Curt, I never noticed a problem either. As a matter of fact
mine set less than 2 feet from the trays and never noticed a problem. 
But to be perfectly honest my GRA is so old that there's hardly any glow
left in the paint, been thinking of painting them with white paint.

Older timers will lose some of their brightness.  If one 
uses a newer 300, it could produce enough light to fog some 
extended developing film.  The Rubylith is available in 
sheets , pads, and rolls. A less active uv light might also 
help.  avoid florescent lamps in the darkroom.  Perhaps just 
raising it up on a shelf would be enough to prevent fogging.

First, I don't understand what complaint you have with the understanding you
derived with the LogD 1.1 negs printing with different results using same
filtration than the LogD 1.5, because that would be natural.

But, your comment regarding what AA wrote and what you discovered, your
opinion about materials changing is correct and correct by the assumption
made after your own tests.

Congratulations.

Now, why is this so?  Among other things, the current, modern materials have
been changed to acknowledge AA and others' experiments; and the current film
is 'self masking'  a development you have to look up because it's easy to
find and I'm not going to type all that info in, here.

However, when you get the opportunity to see a real print by Harry Callahan,
Gene Smith, even Ansel Adams or Tina Moditi ... IN THE REAL, then you will
understandwhat you get with N+ exposure (eN+) and dN+ and your LogD at 1.65
with B+F of 37 or so.

That's when you'll be in the real world, making prints from both electric
lights and sunlight with yellow filters.

Graded papers much better. Also why are we not told that by using Ilford MG

Sorry if I have caused offence - it was certainly not intended, and was
certainly not aimed at you. In fact, it was aimed at a member of the
pure-silver forum who has not yet contributed to this recent discussion, but
who is the person in the UK who continually claims magical results from
split grading, but becomes evasive when tackled on the issue head on. He
normally talks to basic amateur photographers who accept his word as gospel.
I was trying to 'needle' him into a response.
I obviously misjudged my approach and caused offence to you, for which I
apologise unreservedly.

I'm taking this off list because this discussion has gone on way too

I take some exception here, since I'm the one who made the "toolbox"
comment. First of all, I'm in no sense a split filter "evangelist",
and I would never argue that it should be taught as a primary
technique. However, for those of use without access to Color- or
VC-heads, it does provide a level of control that we would not
otherwise have.

No argument there.

[1] though I have to admit that the guy claimed that split printing
was a substitute for burning and dodging -- and was thus a good thing
because B & D was hard to learn -- certainly stirred things up.

I have not yet seen Barry's idea of point source enlarging; I too am waiting
for Santa Claus to bring the book! He is obviously having problems with his
reindeer! However, I printed this way by adapting my Gnome Alfa II universal
enlarger back in the seventies.  An easy way to try this out is to drill a
1/4" hole in the bottom of a suitable size tin can, cut three tags in the
sidewall of the can and fit over the enlarging bulb using the bent tags to
clip over the bulb.
A point that Barry omitted in his posting that I found necessary, is to
increase the height of the lamp house by fitting a 2 1/2" sheet metal spacing
ring, to allow sufficient adjustment of the lamp to get even illumination on
the base board. Having said this, it could be argued that what I have
described is not a true point source, but it is near enough for practical
purposes.

For really good grain, develop the film (preferably 400ASA) in a Monobath
developer. I don't know if proprietary monobath developers are available
these days, but I used the FX6a formula taken from the British Journal of
Photography Annual 1964. This gives excellent, crisp grain that is further
enhanced by a point source enlarger. Later editions of the BJP Annual quote
the FX-16 (grain effects on high speed films) formula. I have not tried it,
but it would be worth a try.  Another way of getting very effective grain
effects is to print a normally processed  negative sandwiched with a grain
screen.

Clifford


Interesting approach - the tin can. Spacing out the head varies. Quite a few
heads don't need it. Some heads won't adapt at all. My Leitz Focomat 1c with
only one aspheric condenser simply will not work with a masked bulb no
matter how I space the head - I guess that is what you would expect with the
precise design and manufacture of Leitz.
Tetenal make a monobath developer for anybody who is interested in trying
this method.

True with one exception - ours!  The Analyser and ZoneMaster uniquely allow
you to preview the effects of printing at the "wrong" grade.

Agreed - you know I am a ZoneMaster user

"Grade" is arbitrary really - one manufacturer's grade 2 is another grade 3
(eg Agfa vs Ilford). ISO(R) contrast range is the only useful measure of
paper contrast because it defines the effective negative density range that
the paper can reproduce. An ISO(R) figure of around 100 is "normal". Unless
you're specifically aiming to print on a fixed grade paper there really
isn't any need to worry *too* much about negative density so long as it's
somewhere near the middle of the range so that you can adjust the paper
contrast either way when printing.  Negs that require a "grade 5" or a
"grade 0" to print are the problem ones - you're up against an end stop.
>
Yes, I am aware of the difficulty of talking in terms of grades. However,
what I am driving at is this, and I admit it is a vague ill defined
generalisation - a negative exposed and developed to print well on a 'grade'
3 produces a print which I feel does not look the same as one of the same
scene exposed and developed to print well on 'grade' 1. I believe the softer
neg/harder 'grade' looks better even when the over all contrast range is
right for both prints.
I don't know whether I am explaining myself clearly, and I am certainly not
making an assertion here. It is just a feeling, and I wonder what other
people feel.

OK, I see the problem.
I cover FX1 in my earlier book, 'Elements', and you can find it in the
appendices of the British Journal of Photography annuals. Steve Anchell and
Bill Troop also give chapter and verse on it in 'The Film Developing
Cookbook'.

Hi Clifford! Thanks for more info about the details of your test. I am
particularly relieved to hear about another disillustrious Focotar, 
since I got it second hand  assumedly matched  with the mint condition
Focomat included in the package and finally sold it with some irrational
gnawing regret. Having been a Leica afcionado for over forty years, my
hurt feelings were, however already soothed a little by the price I got
(about 60% of the amount I originally paid for the lens and the truly
superb enlarger together).
Althouh the topic must seem to be beaten (amost?) to death to & by all of
you other guys there, I am still curious: was the Focotar you tested
marked f 4,5/ 50 mm or f 4,5/ 5cm?
The latest Focotars are 40 mm and won*t fit the Focomat Ic.

Anyone in England suggest a source for 10x8 mounting tissue? Silverprint

Yes, it would be a fairly simple matter wiring-wise - just a 4-way
extension socket with each socket individually switched for example, or a
big rotary switch which simply selects any one enlarger.  If there's
sufficient interest I could look into it.  Depending on how your darkroom's
arranged though I would have thought a bigger problem is being able to
reach one timer from any of four enlargers!



I have four enlarger timers (Stag, Hauck, RH Designs and an old unnamed
one). All have a different 'out' plug to the enlarger. Life would be far
simpler if they were uniform, and I could just plug the one of choice into
the enlarger of choice at any time.
Is there any kind of standard now Richard?

Rob,

That's exactly the point - one stop does not always equal one zone.  For 
your experiment to be valid (and I think it is), it would be correct to 
speak of exposure in terms of stops, not zones. Print or neg densities 
could be spoken of in terms of zones.

For  a terrific explanation, see Phil Davis's book "Beyond the Zone 
System". For those who have not read it (and I don't imply you, simply some 
advise for newcommers) - it's the best read when it comes to sensitometry.

Thanks John and any others who suggested sources. I bought some from Calumet
on line in the UK, but by the time I added the shipping it was 33.96, or
$54.33 in Murkin money, i.e. more than 50c a sheet!

John,
You clearly know your Ilford MG. Could I ask you or anyone else here to
explain a point to me I can't find in the literature. It's this. Presumably
the paper as it's delivered represents normal grade. But the filters you get
go from 00 to 5. So presumably either 21/2 or 3 filter should represent no
change to the paper out of the box? I write should though I know by
experiment that they do make a difference. What's happening here? Is it the
case that VC papers are meant to be used invariably with a filter? I'm sure
my embarrassing denseness in this area comes from learning photography at
art school before VC in the mid 70s. I'm antediluvian and I'm not even 50!

The ones we use, called "IEC" or "CEE22" connectors are more or less the
standard now as they are the only suitable ones to have worldwide approval
from the various safety agencies. One useful aspect of the increasing
globalisation of the marketplace is that these anomalies are, albeit
slowly, disappearing.  Stag, Durst and Hauck used to use (I think) the
European standard "Schuko"-type mains outlet which of course is different
to the 13A standard we have in the UK.  It's different again of course in
the USA where not only is it a different shape, it's a different voltage as
well.  Makes life a bit of a headache sometimes!

IEC connectors are three pin, rectangular, and can also be found on such as
PCs and electric kettles.  They're horrid things to wire up too - like most
"standards" they seem to have adopted the lowest common denominator ....

I've just had a look at the Farnell catalogue and the only mains
distribution block they do with *individually* switched sockets provides 4x
13A sockets.  It costs about 40 pounds +VAT and carriage.  

Tim - the simplest way frankly would be to fit the correct connector to
each of your enlargers and just plug the one you want to use into the timer.

Regards
Richard

I am not familiar with the British photo shops other than their legendary
selection we miss here in the USA. But, why not buy a long roll of the mount
tissue. It costs less this way & you cut to size when you use it. As to
expense of the pre-cut tissue, it is expensive here as well.

Plan on a Utah photo trip in August 2002. Brigham City Museum Gallery will
host a photographic show, The Great American West: The B&W Landscape.
It features the images of Dick Arentz, Paula Chamlee Tillman Crane, Chip
Hooper, Craig Law, Ray McSavaney, Barry Parsons, John Sexton, Dan Smith and
Michael A. Smith.
This a show you don't want to miss and a perfect time to visit Utah on your
vacation. Brigham City is in Northern Utah, about an hour North of Salt Lake
City, home of the Bear River
Migratory Bird Refuge and on the way to Yellowstone National Park.
If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me for information as
I am the curator of the show.

Hello every body,

    Few months ago I posted a question about split grading printing and I
got a lot of controversial answers. I have seen that it is still the case. I
would like just to add that no matter the way how you get a good print the
most important is the result and I am almost sure that every body after some
years of practice has his own way to get the good print he wants. Personally
I use one filter or multiple filters of split grading all depends of the
negative. I would like also to add that I print with a Durst L 1200 with
condensers and tungsten lamps with the filter under the lens. It is the
simplest technique but it works. It is easy to handle you can adjust the
printing time by moving to another lamp very ship (2) from 75w to 250w. No
sophisticated system. There is almost no time for the lamp to get to its
full power like with VC or colour heads and you can use very short times
(0.5s)if you need it.

    Merry Christmas to every body.

        Daniel

With 2 enlargers I was happy plugging and unplugging until I added a ceiling
light for  flashing.  I wired the timer output to 3 standard wall switches in a
standard household utility box from the local hardware (this is your normal wall
light swirch, available single, double, triple).  Left for the left enlarger,
right for the right, middle for flash.  Thence to three wall receptacles to plug
enlargers and light into permanently.  Flashing is a breeze now.  Set timer,
select middle switch, flash; set timer, select right switch, print.  I marked big
arrows left, up, right, to avoid confusion in the heat of battle.

  Well actually I don't know the paper as well as I should; otherwise it
wouldn't give me such a fight sometimes. <g>
  Here's my speculation...that's what it is, and it might be wrong. The
filter set used with its matching paper provides a range of evenly-spaced
contrast grades, while the contrast given with no filter falls a little
above or below that given by the "normal contrast" filter. Or iow, if "2"
is normal, the no-filter contrast may be "1.75" rather than the next lower
step, "1.5."
  I don't use the filters; I use a dichro head and adjust filtration based
simply on wanting higher or lower contrast than whatever I started with, so
that about the filter set is just idle speculation.
  Plotting paper curves would provide the answer.

Yes that is how my flashing system works
When I had to add in the Heiland unit to the f stop timer + the white light
control and different enlargers I had to accommodate moulded plugs from
America, Germany and the UK via a variety of adaptors to cope with all
permutations - that's why it got clumsy!

Thanks for your question. We have just got back from a weekend on our
privatised railways!

 Up until about a year ago I was one of those 'up-rating nerds'. 

HP5 at 1600ASA in Rodinal gave a gritty image of the nearby dark satanic
mills I was trying to capture before they disappeared. 
Those negs are hard work! I am finding starting the exposure 'run' with
Filter 0 helps. (Threshold exposure?).

Then came along a book called Elements (heard of it?), and that changed
everything. HP5 at 200ASA still in Rodinal are great. The Analyser is spot
on just about every time, but sometimes I like to give of Filter 5 (Meopta
Meograde) to finish off.
As a non-technician I can perceive a difference between the single and split
filtered prints, especially when all four are on the same sheet using a Nova
easel.

Hope Amazon books gee up Santa before next weekend!

Geoff

Geoff Mitchell commented: 

Just to throw another nugget into this pot. 

Since reading the messages f-stop printing, then Harry Fearn's book on B&W 
printing I have been trying the following; 

Meopta Mag 4 enlarger and a RH Design Analyser. 

Get the suggested filter/time reading. 

Stop down 2 stops and give the zero filter 

Adjust to minus half stop and expose with the Analyser suggested filter 

Then minus one and half stops to finish off with a five filter. 

Different negatives need variations on this theme, but I am really enjoying 
the darkroom these days - makes a change from swearing at Photoshop! 


Geoff 
Why do you do this Geoff instead of taking a straight reading and exposing 
at the single filter indicated? Wouldn't that be simpler and quicker? What 
advantage do you gain by all this?

Objet : Re Split grading printing

Hello every body,

    Few months ago I posted a question about split grading printing and I
got a lot of controversial answers. I have seen that it is still the case. I
would like just to add that no matter the way how you get a good print the
most important is the result and I am almost sure that every body after some
years of practice has his own way to get the good print he wants. Personally
I use one filter or multiple filters of split grading all depends of the
negative. I would like also to add that I print with a Durst L 1200 with
condensers and tungsten lamps with the filter under the lens. It is the
simplest technique but it works. It is easy to handle you can adjust the
printing time by moving to another lamp very ship (2) from 75w to 250w. No
sophisticated system. There is almost no time for the lamp to get to its
full power like with VC or colour heads and you can use very short times
(0.5s)if you need it.

    Merry Christmas to every body.

        Daniel

The pure-silver pages (and all the rest of www.tundraware.com) have been
updated.  This is primarily a facelift, but you can also now go directly
to the darkroom and bear pictures.

Have a look...

Tim,
I am not the the author of this greeting but have merely passed it on in the spirit it was received.
Since we are entering one of the annual silly seasons I may as well relay another Politically Correct little gem which I heard on the radio the other night.

The local authorities in a town in the US (I forget which one) have banned all public buildings in their jurisdiction from displaying Christmas Trees incase it offends persons of other religions! 

No more  off topic mails I promise.

Steve and others,

How much improvement in negative quality is gained by developing for a 1.1 LogD  negative instead of a 1.5 LogD negative.
Please assume the subject and purpose of this hypothetical negative is for producing a fine landscape print with a full tonal range.
Also assume a slowish Tgrain film such as Delta 100. Would the difference be insignificant, significant or very significant.
I merely ask this so that I can get an idea of which route to go down with film testing for 4x5 negs.

Oh that's happened in England too, in the midlands. It reminds me of the
time someone got upset when I used the term niggardly, presuming that this
ancient Scandanavian rooted word could have any connection with the American
insult. Some people are just too sensitive for their pants.

I know we're getting way off topic here but need I remind you that not all
of us celebrate Christmas.  In fact some of us really don't like having it
shoved down our throat every where we turn, especially by our public
institutions whom are supposed to be neutral in these matters.

I don't think that makes any of us 'PC'

That being said, I loved the PC Holiday Greetings.

ok... I'm off my soapbox.

   I don't know if Ruyblith was a Kodak product but it is still available
at stores which sell graphic arts supplies. There is a similar amber
colored gel called Amberlith. Either is an effective safelight filter. I
believe the intended purpose is as a masking material.

Barry,

As the person you have been trying to needle for some months now I think that it is time that I responded to your misleading and incorrect allegations. I do think that you should have had the courage to name names instead of hiding behind the vague description "seminar lecturer" as used in your posting of 15th December. I have deliberately avoided making a reply to your "needling" as I feel that this excellent forum is about photography and not personalities. Your continued veiled attacks have left me with no alternative but to defend myself and my reputation as a printer and teacher. 

I have never claimed magical results from split grade printing, that is your incorrect description of one of many ways of approaching the making of a fine print. During the past few months you have asked me to post my method, I did this some months ago and can only assume that you either missed it or did not understand it.  I am not in the habit of evading questions or issues. Ask anyone who has approached me on any issue.

In the 15th December posting you referred to "standing at the back of several classes with the seminar lecturer", presumably myself. I can recall only one seminar of mine where you stood at the back. That would be Focus at the NEC in Birmingham 2 or perhaps 3 years ago when you introduced yourself at the end of a 1.5 hour long demonstration during an Ilford Masterclass. I recall your parting words were " you have shown me how to make prints from  old negatives that I have never managed to print before". I was only demonstrating very basic slpit grade printing that day. Strange statement from a printer who does not believe in the method. 

I do not and never have claimed that split grade printing is the only way of making prints, merely that it does offer certain benefits when a particular type of negative is produced. In my workshops I do teach all methods of print making using graded as well as VC papers and all methods of print development. Not the approach of a "zealot" as you have described split graders in recent postings. 

You talk of me teaching "basic amateur photographers"  who treat my word as gospel. I find this quite insulting not only to myself but more importantly to the many amateur photographers who are at present hoping to get a copy of your latest book in their Christmas Stocking. Your words seem to me to imply that amateur photographers are somewhat inferior beings, how wrong you are. For the record and for those who do not know me, in addition to teaching amateur photographers I do teach degree Courses in Universities and Art Colleges on both sides of the Atlantic. 

Barry, perhaps I can suggest that you leave personalities out of postings in future there is no gain for anyone in such entries least of all the subscribers to a very informative and stimulating news group. Your methods work for you and mine for me let us agree to disagree and get on with this wonderful obsessive thing called photography. 

To all other subscribers to this list please accept my apologies for subjecting you to this posting. I hope that you understand my reasons and that I had to answer what was being said about me.

Les McLean

Sorry if I have caused offence - it was certainly not intended, and was
certainly not aimed at you. In fact, it was aimed at a member of the
pure-silver forum who has not yet contributed to this recent discussion, but
who is the person in the UK who continually claims magical results from
split grading, but becomes evasive when tackled on the issue head on. He
normally talks to basic amateur photographers who accept his word as gospel.
I was trying to 'needle' him into a response.
I obviously misjudged my approach and caused offence to you, for which I
apologise unreservedly.

I'm taking this off list because this discussion has gone on way too
long, and seems to have more to do with an unfortunate experience
that Curt had with an inept associate than anything else. [1]

I take some exception here, since I'm the one who made the "toolbox"
comment. First of all, I'm in no sense a split filter "evangelist",
and I would never argue that it should be taught as a primary
technique. However, for those of use without access to Color- or
VC-heads, it does provide a level of control that we would not
otherwise have.

No argument there.

-t

[1] though I have to admit that the guy claimed that split printing
was a substitute for burning and dodging -- and was thus a good thing
because B & D was hard to learn -- certainly stirred things up.

  I am just catching up with e-mail after being away for about two weeks. 
 The ISO grades are supposed to be universal. Up to about ten years ago
(maybe longer) each manufacturer did have different specs for the negative
log density range which its grades corresponded to. Agfa grade numbers were
about one number higher for a given contrast than nearly everyone else.
This is no longer true.
  All sorts of things affect the effective contrast of paper, one of the
major ones is the surface. The scattering of light from the surface of any
but glossy paper reduces the maximum black, and hense the overall
brightness range of the paper. This is equivalent to changing the curve
shape. It results in lowered shadow contrast of matt surface papers
compared to glossy. 
  The contrast grade of the paper is the difference in log exposure between
an exposure which just results in a visible darkening and the exposure for
some point in the shadow with a minimum contrast. Its not the exposure for
true Dmax since that is _never_ reached in normal use.
  The overall density of the negative is of no consequence, it is the
contrast index which is important.
  The idea of the Zone System is to produce negatives with more or less
constant density range from subjects with differing luminance ranges, in
other words, adjusting the contrast of the negative so that it will print
on a "normal" grade paper. 
  Probably there is no reason to avoid paper with grades within about one
grade of normal. Papers with more than that difference sometimes have
changes in curve shape which affect the tonal rendition even though
negatives which should print exactly the same are used. 
  There is an advantage to avoiding negatives with very high densities. For
one thing, they can be hard to print requiring long printing times. For
another, in general grain increases with density, so a negative with
minimum density will generally look less grainy than a similar but more
dense one. Also, the light scattered in the emulsion tends to make dense
negatives less sharp than thinner ones. So, if you can adjust the contrast
of the negative so that the scene is reproduced on normal, or nearly
normal, grade paper there is some advantage. 
  Also note that high contrast paper exagerates any uneveness of light in
the printer, and also exagerates any blemishes on the negative. 
  Very high contrast paper can be a life saver for severely underexposed
negatives but should be avoided when not necessary.

Wow, Tim, nice darkroom.

I love the little racks you have for the lensboards and film holders.

I do find the 5-hour advantage enjoyed by the Brits less than fully

Howmuch is gained?  Not enough to make it worth the endless testing.  It
would be easier to bracket:  Make four exposures, mark them N, N+ etc. then
develop N normally, take it from there.  AA did that and ended by throwing
away lots of exposed, undeveloped film because he got what he wanted the
first time.  BUT, he had the back ups and did use one or the other enough
times to prove it was aluable until he had the film and developer pegged.

Yeah, besides photography and computers, I'm fond of making sawdust and,
occasionally, even furniture ;)  I made the boxes out of oak and cut the
grooves for the lenses/carriers on a router table.  Stained and finished
in a PolyAcrylic which is very durable, waterproof, and not too shiny.

I have been 'lurking' on and off for a while but this is my first
contribution.
I attended a workshop run by the man Barry Thornton is tring to 'needle' and
it was clearly demonstrated that for many negatives, particulary those with
good to high contrast, split grade printing, properly applied, can give very
good results.
I know that the starting point should always be a properly exposed and
properly processed negative. But with 35mm film which usually contains
negatives exposed under more than one lighting condition and range of
contrast, this is not always possible. So, to extract the best from some
negatives, why not use a technique that works.

Incidentally, I,m still waiting for my copy of Barry's new book.

Best wishes to all for Christmas and the New Year

The difference in colour and smell of the different
films has made me curious. Could anyone supply some
information on the history of the chemistry applied to
film emulsions and where different film emulsions fit
in to that history?

Thanks.

There was a postal dispute at the South Wales & Bristol
sorting offices. Two weeks ago TV national news stated it
would take 10 days to clear the backlog. That ties in with my
experience. I received Barry's book about 11 days after he
posted it. The stamp had not been cancelled and there was no
date/postmark so I don't think the parcel had been through
the normal channels. Usually I'd expect Parcel Force to deliver
in 2-3 days. Hopefully this backlog has now been cleared.

I loved the nice tile floor.  Must be nicer on the feet than the cold

Just curious: (1) when you speak of "split grading printing"  exactly what
are you referring to? I believe that part of the reason for the
controversies that existover this technique is because different people use
the term "split printing" to mean different things. So could you describe
how you actually work when you do "split grading printing?" (2) you said
that sometimes you use one filter or "multiple filters of split grading"
depending on the negative. What are the negative characteristics that cause
you to decide to use "multiple filters of split grading" and what exactly is
it that you do? Again, this is just to satisfy my own curiosity. I certainly
agree that different people use different methods and whatever works is
fine. My only problem comes when people make outrageous or unfounded claims
for a particular technique and then try to convince others, particularly
students or other beginners,  to use the technique. Thanks. Brian

Since I asked someone else this question, I guess I should ask you also.
What do you mean by "split filter printing?" In other words, could you
describe how you do it?  Thank. Brian

Oh, man, if *any* of you are standing on concrete, you *have* to buy
yourself a length of this stuff:

Forget this paper vs. that paper, or XTOL vs. Pyro vs. D23... a comfortable
floor mat will make more of a difference in your darkroom experience than
anything else you can possibly buy.

I have been watching the split printing debate with some amusement -
the intensity of the argument (as always) seems to be inversely proportional
to the amount of science and fact being brought to bear.

Be that as it may, you all may be interested to know that shortly after
Les McLean challenged (very politely, I might add) Barry Thornton's
commentary, behavior, and the like, Barry unsubscribed from this group.
I wonder why?

I think that most folks involved in the back-and-forth discussion of the
topic are in full agreement.  Split-filter or split-grade printing means
only one thing: using a magenta or #5 MG filter for part of the exposure
of a print and a yellow or #00 MG filter for the other part.  The theory
is - so say its supporters - that some sort of magic happens by "setting"
the blacks with magenta and the high values with the yellow.  This method
does allow one to achieve a very fine print.  Sensitometrically, there's
no difference between that method and finding a certain one filter of
either color.  The same print can be achieved...and with a lot less
trouble, shorter exposure times and far fewer (expensive) enlarger lamps.

I think what so many of us respond to is that while we all agree you can
achieve as good a print by this method, why make life more complicated
than necessary?  What SCARES us is that proponents of split-filter
printing seem to think they are achieving something in their prints that
the rest of us are missing with single filter printing.  That's just not
so.  And for those of us trying to make money printing - mercenary as that
might sound - the wasted time and money makes the whole idea preposterous.

Just my 2c,

Curt

Friends -

I certainly hope Barry comes back to the fold.  I would guess his leaving
is for reasons other than a lack of science, however.  He is a thoughtful
and experienced practitioner from whom we all benefit and to whom we owe a
great deal of gratitude.

Now that the debate has settled down a bit, I thought I'd offer my 
POV on why I split print.

It is pretty well established that one can achieve identical sensiometric
results from split printing versus using a single filter appropriately
chosen.  So, for the record, I do not think split printing is magic
or the results unattainable using other methods.  However, split printing
offers some advantages that are a matter of convenience and darkroom practice
that I much prefer:

1) Repeatability:  If you are using a color head marked in CC of filtration,
it is easy to get back to that setting at a later date.  However, I use a
VC cold light head with continuous controls for hard and soft light.  While
the adjustments are marked, they are rather coarse, and it is easier to
get repeatable results simply by using hard light full on or soft light full
on.

2) Easier control of local contrast:  One of the wonders of VC paper is that
you can vary contrast ranges locally across the real estate of the print.
If you use single filtration, you have to control *two* variables for each
area in which you are modifying the local contrast - the exact filter setting
(ratio of magenta to yellow light) and exposure time.  With split
filtering you always use max magenta/yellow - there is only *one* variable
to control: the ratio of magenta time/yellow time used during the
exposure for each area being enhanced.  Simpler and more repeatable IMHO.

3) Fixed filter sets:  Not everyone has or can afford a VC head for
their enlarger.  Many people still happily use a fixed filter set from
Ilford or Kodak.  These filters limit the printer to a discrete number
of contrast steps.  By split printing (using only, say, the #0 and #6
filters), a printer w/o a VC head can command the same local contrast
control available with the much more pricey VC heads.

4) Quicker:  Even though you have to make two exposures for each print
area under consideration, in my experience, split printing properly
practiced actually gets to a final print *quicker* than single filter
VC printing.  Here's why.  When I first make a test print, I make
a set of magenta exposure strips along one axis of the paper and
then go back and do the same with yellow on the other axis.  In one
test print, I can almost always determine the ratio of magenta to
yellow and the exposure time from the resulting "crosshatch".  With
single filter approaches, I found myself spending lots of time trying 
to find the right first settings because I was worried about filtration 
ratios *and* time.

Finally, some here have suggested that split filtering is bad because
it eats more enlarger bulbs (!)  Hmmm, I have thousands upon thousands
of dollars invested cameras, darkroom hardware, not to mention travel
costs to go where the snapshots are.  Even if I used a head that
had bulbs, the cost to replace them more often seems to me to be
trivial in the larger scheme of things.

At the end of the day, when someone argues technique, my inevitable
response is "Show me your prints."  Prints are all that matter -
technique merely is a means to them.  If your printing approach
results in lovely prints, blessings be upon you, don't change a thing.
As a side note, I often find that people who have a deep religious
zeal for or against a particular technique, frequently produce some
of the most boring, tedious, and trivial images on the face of the
planet.

In other words, my view is that you should do whatever it takes, however
it works for you, to make the most beautiful pictures you can - *that*
is the point, not how many CCs of filtration you use...

The real problem is that most of us who use a single filter for printing
don't really care if others use split-filter printing.  If it works, go
for it.  Over the years, however, it is the split-filter contingent who
tells the rest of us that we don't know what we're doing or what we're
missing or about the magic split-filter printing does for
"micro-contrasts."  Personally, I use a bunch of different contrast
control methods fluidly because I have four enlargers and three
different light sources.  Since I produce relatively consistent
negatives, I can pretty much start up where I left off, so-to-speak,
with any of the machines. 

Most of the split-filter printers I've known personally are "technique
freaks" and, I would agree with Tim, produce some of the most banal work
I've ever seen.  What isn't subjective is that when you print through
170cc of two colors of filters - ceteris paribus - printing times are
longer, throughput is slower and light bulbs burn out faster.  Again, to
those who don't care, go for it.

I guess, on the balance, what separates the split printers from the single
filter crowd is that the single filter crowd acknowledges that a perfect
print can be achieved by split filter methods while the split filter crowd
(usually) denies that the single-filter printer can do likewise.  I wonder
why?

Well, I'm a 'split printer' and acknowledge all these techniques as
valid.  I would disagree that folks in my camp are particularly worse
than others, BTW.  I've seen religion in all quarters over the years.

Happy printing...

Folks... and Les and Barry <s>,

I ain't going to get into the role of referee in this lively debate (I might
receive more than two thick ears... although I'm confident of nothing below
the belt) but I can add something as an involved observer. I'm involved in a
roundabout way because (perhaps uniquely) I have prints from both
protagonists hanging on my walls. Both photographer's images are quite
different landscapes... both obviously, judging from their creator's
reasoned approaches, made using their best technical methods... and do you
know, folks... they are damned fine prints! They're as good as any of the
number of John Sexton's and Ted Orland's (both assistants to Ansel Adams in
the 70/80s) I also have in my collection.

I also like to think that I can make a print worth buying for a collection
(done it/sold my first examples at Christies-London in the early 80s/haven't
bothered with the T-shirt yet!)... but horrors upon horrors... I now use a
computerised Durst Laborator Multigraph to choose the paper grade (to the
nearest 1/10th of a grade) and exposure time (to the nearest 1/100th of a
second). Am I a cheat or what? Nah!

Someone remarked to me (off-list) that this whole re-debate was becoming "as
boring as watching paint dry"... but therein lies an analogy. To paint your
front door (the bit that can make first impressions on
friends/neighbours/salesmen) you can use straight-out-of-the-can non-drip
paint (as in fixed grade)... or you can use an undercoat and a topcoat (as
in split-grade)... and maybe a varnish to add that final touch of quality
(as in after-toning)... or even a spray-can! Both non-drip and
undercoat/top-coat painting can look great... if done properly with the
right preparations and brushes... and as in the darkroom, THEY'RE JUST
TOOLS. (OK, forget the spray-can, they're for autos!)

    Many others have already answered what split grading printing means and
I do not want to start again a " big fight". You can look at the Chris
Woodhouse article in Camera and Darkroom Issue 42 1999. The technique is
very well described.

Well said Tim.

In recent weeks we have thrashed the horse of technique to within an inch
of his life and perhaps in our obsession with "how" we have tended to
overlook "why".  To revert to my hi-fi analogy for a moment, we've been
discussing gold-plated connectors instead of listening to the music.

For me, photography is a near-perfect marriage of art and craft, of
technology and expression.  The techniques and technology are the craft,
but what many of us are striving for surely is art and expression?  The
production of something which *communicates* to the viewer? The more
knowledge and understanding we have of technique then the easier comes the
expression.  That was my point in previous postings - that no-one should
suggest that any particular technique is the best, or the *only*, but share
knoweldge and experience with others so that they can make up their own
minds should they wish to explore alternatives.  That is what is so
marvellous about forums such as this, they enable discussions between
people of widely different opinion, knowledge and experience, and offer the
opportunity for all of us to learn and grow.  Unfortunately at present this
is offset by the frustrating limitations of a text-based forum - we cannot
*see* each other's prints in the flesh as it were, and there is no
substitute for seeing and appreciating the real, final, fine print.

Everyone's needs are different - someone who makes prints for a living will
have different values to one who simply wishes to make an artistic
statement, and each can choose the techniques most relevant to them
provided they have the knowledge to make a decision.  It seems to me that
this type of discussion list verges on the ideal forum for such knowledge
to be shared.

If the negative is the score and the print is the performance, then the
wide variety of alternatives of photographic technique are the instruments
of that performance.  If the score's written for strings, no one would
suggest it should only be played on brass.

Regards
Richard

Actually the reason for the question is that people have not always used the
term to mean the same thing. Some people use the term "split printing" to
mean the practice of burning in an area of the print with a different filter
than was used for the basic print, a practice which I think is uniformly
accepted as being appropriate but which isn't, in my experience at least,
what is meant by the term split printing. However, occasionally when someone
says that split printing is great, upon inquiry it is learned that they are
talking about the practice of burning an area or areas of the print with a
different filter than was used for the basic exposure. That was why I asked
the question.

I wasn't trying to start of big fight, I just asked a question. I know what
the term means, but not everyone uses it the same way, which was why I was
curious as to how you were using it. I don't subscribe to the magazine so I
can't refer to the article you cited.

  I've gotten matting similar to the "anti-fatigue" matting at Home Depot.
It comes in 36" x 36" squares for about $25 each. This is the stuff with
holes in it. It rests on many small fingers so that liquids run under it. 
  The stuff I got was black, and had a very strong new rubber odor, which
takes several weeks to dissipate. It may not be the same as the Rubbermaid
material. It is very comfortable to stand on. If you get the smelly kind I
recommend hanging it up outdoors for a couple of weeks before installing it
indoors.

I don't recall seeing a reply to this question, asked a day or so ago by 
another subscriber:

How can I TEMPORARILY unsubscribe, since I will be out of town for an 
extended holiday?  Since the list is "full," I don't want to be turned down 
upon attempting to re-subscribe upon my return.

Sorry if I missed the original reply; I know it can be annoying to repeat 
oneself.  Thanks!

In darkroom bliss,

Adrienne

Unsubscribe as usual - and resubscribe when you wish.  The list is not
"full" by any means and never will be until I run out of bandwidth (a long
way away if ever).  I merely personally check every subscription request 
to minimize exposure to spam... Any (reasonable) person subscribing
will be permitted on the list...

I don't think you can.  Looks like tundraware is running majordomo mailing
list and you probably need to unsubsribe and resubscribe.  I think
listserv type lists lets you temporarily put yourself on "no-mail" mode or
something like that.  I think the syntax for listserv is something like
"set nomail [listname]" but this is getting OT.

Curt,

Until 6 years ago I used only graded papers, mainly Agfa Record Rapid, Portriga and Brovira. In the UK we had no access to the range of VC papers that you had in the States. When Agfa made MCC I was asked to test it for them and liked what I saw and so started to use VC papers for the first time. My assumption was that the accountants would eventually win the day and stop the marketing of graded papers because they would not make enough profit. Consequently we would have been forced to get to grips with VC papers, like it or not. I speak as a trained accountant who got out of that way of life. Thankfully that does not seem to have happened and so we have got the best of both worlds. 

Even though I am a split grader I do make about 40% of my prints on graded papers for I believe they offer different qualities from VC. Different surface, toning in a different way, paper base may be different in colour, final untoned print colour is very likely to be different. These are just a few of the differences  which have to be considered in the making of a fine print. On the emotive subject of split grade printing I think Tim has just about summed it up. There are benefits to be had in both schools and I do believe that we should all keep a very open mind.

I sure hope that's not the end take on all of the discussion.
Split-filter or split-printing is how some folks make all of their regular
prints.  Single-filter printers use one filter to achieve the same
results.  BOTH groups use (these with) other methods or tools to solve
"problems."

It is possible that none of the preceding dialogue on the subject was
clear and, to the extent I was just as unclear in identifying both
approaches as each group's standard approach to making prints from
negatives within the bell curve of normal range, I apologize.  Neither
method is right and neither method is wrong.  And neither method is able
to give a result that the other can't.  On this last point we
single-filter printers are quick to point out.  I've never, however, heard
a split-filter printer concede that their method doesn't yield something
"extra" in a print.  Those extras are usually identified as control over
local contrast or micro-contrast.  If we single-filter guys weren't
getting sufficient control and were able to achieve this extra print
quality by simply switching to split-filter printing then I can assure you
we'd move over to the other camp in a minute and without blinking.  After
all, those of us looking to go to the next higher level of print quality
will go to whatever reasonable extreme necessary to do so.

You know, in a similar vein, there was a group of printers who, for years,
refused to accept that a good print could be made on VC papers EVER.  Only
graded papers had the potential to yield a great print.  Personally, the
last graded paper I used was in about 1967 when my dad worked for Agfa and
would bring home Brovira #5 so I could print some of my mistakes.  Other
than that, I always used Varigam, Varilour or Polycontrast papers...and
they produced beautiful results.  Tody's papers are much better yet.

I'm sure that Silverprint, an English photo supplier stocks Azo paper. If it is the same as the paper you refer to it must still be available in the states. If you wish I could call Silverprint  to enquire about it and where they obtain supplies.

Les -

I would guess there is still much to be offered with graded papers,
particularly, as you indicated, with regard to image color, surface
texture, etc.  If I were printing full time, I would get to know the
individual nature of the different graded papers - as should any full time
printer.  That not being the case, I'm delighted to exploit all of the
nuances of one or two VC papers.  My favorites are Ilford MGIV and Agfa
MCC.  So many times I see folks playing with so many different materials
that they never get to know any one of them particularly well.  One paper
I really miss is Azo DW.  I was looking at some prints the other day that 
I made back in the '50s with Azo.  The texture, color and feel of the
paper is superb.

Regards,
Curt

Diane,

My absolute favourite graded paper is Kodak Ektalure but they have decided to stop manufacture as of Feb/March of this year. I have several hundred sheets of 16 x 20 in the freezer which I use only for very special prints. Of the graded papers available in the UK I use Oriental Seagull and a little Kodak Fine art. Both of these papers give a good neutral/cold tone which I prefer for my documentary work. Forte do a good paper called Bromofort but I have to say that my experience with Forte papers is that they can be inconsistent from batch to batch. I don't just mean slightly inconsistent, the changes can be considerable therefore I have chosen not to use them for the past 2 or 3 years. It's a pity that they are as they are for Forte papers are beautiful when the batch is OK. Perhaps I should give them another try, they may have changed since I last used them.

You ask for a graded paper similar to Galerie. I have to confess that I used very little of it for when it was popular I preferred Agfa Record Rapid. I recall that it was slightly warm and would suggest that you try one of the Forte warm tone papers. I would also suggest that you try Kentona, a paper made in the UK by Kentmere. I have always thought that it is probably the best of the Kentmere range but they have never pushed it in the market place. If you are based in the states it will be sold by Luminos but under a different name. Get back to me if you cannot locate it, I have contacts in both Lumoinos and Kentmere.

I agree very much with what you wrote here, and am curious to know which your favorite graded papers are these days, and in particular, which paper would you consider closest to the old Galerie?

...Tim, I try to picture this: so you produce some kind of "chess-board"
consisting of squares, each with a different yellow/magenta ratio, and
than you pick one of these squares as the right exposure. But is that
not a bit limiting in the sense that the "right" square can be on a less
important area ie and thus you derive a less than optimal exposure.. Or
do you make the testprint of the same size as the final print? And how
many exposures (f-stops..;-)..) do you make for your teststrip?

Recently I shifted from Xtol to Rodinal for processing AGfapan APX400
(120). 1+50, 11 min., 20degC. This after advice of this forum (I was not
happy with the sharpness of APX400 in Xtol). Indeed the sharpness en the
accutance improved as well as a the grain (ofcourse, but quite pleasing
actually).

I do see quite some more B+F with this combo though.More than with Xtol.
I did not measure it though, but it is considerable.

Is this increase of B+F normal for Rodinal? I used 3 months old Rodinal,
which I have aliquoted in smaller bottles. I did notice (after
processing) a precipitate of crystals on the bottom of the bottle, which
I find a bit worrysome. Maybe KBR?  Seems not very likely to me..
The negatives came out nice though (except for the B+F, this B+F showed
up from the start)


Any feedback on this appreciated,

Cor

Funny you should ask this question. This is where the whole shouting match
started. Using a Jobo testprinter lets you do this quite easily....

1) For this approach to work quickly you have to have pretty consistent
   negatives.  Mosty, I do.

2) My test prints are at full size - I found out I save paper in the long run.

3) Even so, you do have to do a bit of guesstimating - as you point out,
   the magenta/yellow ratio will probably be different across the print,
   certainly if you want to manipulate local contrast.  This is merely a
   technique that gets you "in the ballpark" rapidly.  Fine printing is
   still an art, after all ;

4) Given the consistency I am typically able to get out of my negs,
   the range of times is pretty similar - 10 strips, f/8, enlarger at
   (whatever height projects a 16x20 image) inches, 5 seconds per strip.
   Obviously, you have to do this calibration for your own darkroom.

This whole thing has given me a "split headache". A knife ,
in an master builder hand, can be used as a screwdriver.
Split printing is a tool for specific uses- it is not ( as
pointed out by several postings) a panacea to all problems.
After all, anybody remember "Flash Printing" from the 60's?

I sure hope that's not the end take on all of the discussion.
Split-filter or split-printing is how some folks make all of their regular
prints.  Single-filter printers use one filter to achieve the same
results.  BOTH groups use (these with) other methods or tools to solve
"problems."

It is possible that none of the preceding dialogue on the subject was
clear and, to the extent I was just as unclear in identifying both
approaches as each group's standard approach to making prints from
negatives within the bell curve of normal range, I apologize.  Neither
method is right and neither method is wrong.  And neither method is able
to give a result that the other can't.  On this last point we
single-filter printers are quick to point out.  I've never, however, heard
a split-filter printer concede that their method doesn't yield something
"extra" in a print.  Those extras are usually identified as control over
local contrast or micro-contrast.  If we single-filter guys weren't
getting sufficient control and were able to achieve this extra print
quality by simply switching to split-filter printing then I can assure you
we'd move over to the other camp in a minute and without blinking.  After
all, those of us looking to go to the next higher level of print quality
will go to whatever reasonable extreme necessary to do so.

You know, in a similar vein, there was a group of printers who, for years,
refused to accept that a good print could be made on VC papers EVER.  Only
graded papers had the potential to yield a great print.  Personally, the
last graded paper I used was in about 1967 when my dad worked for Agfa and
would bring home Brovira #5 so I could print some of my mistakes.  Other
than that, I always used Varigam, Varilour or Polycontrast papers...and
they produced beautiful results.  Tody's papers are much better yet.

This was actually true in the '70s, as the '60s VC papers were no longer 
available.The only VC papers available in the '70s were horrible;as were 
the filters.
I used only graded papers from the 70's until just a few years ago when I 
started printing with VC paper for some of my clients. The modern VC 
papers are much improved.
For my highest quality personal work I still prefer graded paper.

Gee at least we're starting to beat a different horse! ; )

The precipitate is p-aminophenol, and actually, it might be
a good sign. If one prepares Rodinal from p-aminophenol
hydrochloride, the steps involve the addition of potassium
metabisulfite to the p-AP HCl solution, and titration with
40% NaOH or KOH. As the pH rises, the free base may come out
of solution, and goes back in with base. The titration
should be stopped when there is a very small amount of
precipitate of the free base. If the endpoint is passed, the
solution may be too alkaline and won't be as stable. Usually
when that happens, bisulfite crystals can be added to reduce
the pH until a small amount of precipitate forms.

About ten years ago, Agfa changed its packaging in the US,
and there were problems with stability - the concentrate was
inactive after a few months of storage. I found that there
was no precipitate, and that a large amount of bisulfite was
required to back titrate the commercial product. After a
small precipitate was formed, I repackaged the developer in
glass bottles with plastic caps, and it was stable for many
years until it was all used (I don't use it often).

Many high energy developers which don't have restainers
added will give higher B+F levels. I don't know if that's
the case with APX 400 & Rodinal, since I haven't used that
combination for a long time. If you feel that it may have a
deleterious effect in prints, consider shooting a roll of
120, and chopping it up into 6" sections for clip tests. You
can use around 0.35 g/l KBr in the water used for dilution,
which should suppress fog but might cost 1/3 to 1/2 stop
speed loss. Also, the film toe might disappear (straight
line). Alternatively, a small amount of benzotriazole might
help.

I'd do A:B comparisions with/without restrainer from the
same roll using duplicate frames, and enlarge to see if
there was an improvemnt or not. I don't know wether the
prints will be better, worse or unchanged. The grain may be
finer, which is often the case with KBr (slower speed - more
exposure - more exposed crystals - more even grain pattern).

Take care, Mike

When Agfa made MCC I was asked to test it for them and liked what I saw and so started to use VC papers for the first time. My assumption was that the accountants would eventually win the day and stop the marketing of graded papers because they would not make enough profit. Consequently we would have been forced to get to grips with VC papers, like it or not. I speak as a trained accountant who got out of that way of life. Thankfully that does not seem to have happened and so we have got the best of both worlds.

Different surface, toning in a different way, paper base may be different in colour, final untoned print colour is very likely to be different. These are just a few of the differences  which have to be considered in the making of a fine print. On the emotive subject of split grade printing I think Tim has just about summed it up. There are benefits to be had in both schools and I do believe that we should all keep a very open mind.

Les -

I would guess there is still much to be offered with graded papers,
particularly, as you indicated, with regard to image color, surface
texture, etc.  If I were printing full time, I would get to know the
individual nature of the different graded papers - as should any full time
printer.  That not being the case, I'm delighted to exploit all of the
nuances of one or two VC papers.  My favorites are Ilford MGIV and Agfa
MCC.  So many times I see folks playing with so many different materials
that they never get to know any one of them particularly well.  One paper
I really miss is Azo DW.  I was looking at some prints the other day that 
I made back in the '50s with Azo.  The texture, color and feel of the
paper is superb.

Regards,
Curt

It would be really nice if message responders would clip the original mail

Sorry Don. The lack of clipping is one of my hates too. Please excuse a slip
of the snips. As for placing text after the original message, it depends
whether you're using Outlook Express or not whether it's more convenient to

You can get single weight AZO paper from Freestyle, it only comes in 2 sizes 
if memory serves me well, 8X10, and 16X20, in 2 grades, a F2 and a F 3, price 
is about $68.95 for a 100 sheet box of 8X10, I had heard rumblings that Kodak 
is looking into discontinuing this AZO, unless sufficient amounts were 
purchased retail to make it profitable for Kodak... you might wanna check ; 
http://www.michaelandpaula.com , on the web site the Smiths refer to AZO , 
etc..

It's likely that a standard splitter would work, and unlikely you'd damage
anything by trying it, although I can't be certain of the latter.  I don't
know a source for footswitches with that connector type.

Les,

    You should also consider Bergger papers graded or VC. I believe it is
possible to find them in England. I have tried most of them and I used most
of the time Bergger VC CB (warmtone) it is heavy and has wonderful blacks.
The only problem is it is a slow paper about 2.5 slower than Ilford VC for
exemple.

    Daniel

Azo is available from at least three sources, and probably more, in the
United States. The three sources that I've dealt with are Freestyle Sales,
B&H Photo, and Calumet.

Different surface, toning in a different way, paper base may be different in
colour, final untoned print colour is very likely to be different. These are
just a few of the differences  which have to be considered in the making of

Zone VI/Calumet  makes (or at least used to make - I haven't checked lately)
two compensating timers, a developing timer and an exposure timer. I use the
developing timer and I've ordered an extra foot pedal for it from Calumet.

Thank Les and Guy.  I know Azo is still around...but in single weight
only.  There was always a sensuousness to working the real double weight
stock around in a tray of Dektol.

When Agfa made MCC I was asked to test it for them and liked what I saw and so started to use VC papers for the first time. My assumption was that the accountants would eventually win the day and stop the marketing of graded papers because they would not make enough profit. Consequently we would have been forced to get to grips with VC papers, like it or not. I speak as a trained accountant who got out of that way of life. Thankfully that does not seem to have happened and so we have got the best of both worlds.

Different surface, toning in a different way, paper base may be different in colour, final untoned print colour is very likely to be different. These are just a few of the differences  which have to be considered in the making of a fine print. On the emotive subject of split grade printing I think Tim has just about summed it up. There are benefits to be had in both schools and I do believe that we should all keep a very open mind.

If you like that feel, try Bergger or Forte. Both work very well, though
they are not Azo. It is said Bergger is introducing a paper similar to Azo,
though faster. If so, I will definately try it.






Plan on a Utah photo trip in August 2002. Brigham City Museum Gallery will
host a photographic show, The Great American West: The B&W Landscape.
It features the images of Dick Arentz, Paula Chamlee Tillman Crane, Chip
Hooper, Craig Law, Ray McSavaney, Barry Parsons, John Sexton, Dan Smith and
Michael A. Smith.
This a show you don't want to miss and a perfect time to visit Utah on your
vacation. Brigham City is in Northern Utah, about an hour North of Salt Lake
City, home of the Bear River
Migratory Bird Refuge and on the way to Yellowstone National Park.
If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me for information as
I am the curator of the show.
Dan Smith

I don't want to ignite another cold light vs. condenser debate. I just want
to know what cold light source people are using. I was considering the basic
Aristo cold light for my Omega D5 but don't see anyway of using an above the
lens contrast filter. The more costly CL4500 from Aristo has a filter drawer
but tha unit is $700. What cold light source are people using? Is the $1000
variable contrast model the only good choice? I didn't want to spend that
much. Advice on using the $200 model would be helpful. 


Thanks

A cold light vs. condenser debate could be quite interesting, at least
for one like me who have never tried a cold light enlarger; I'm still
using an old German (made by Ferd. Homrich & Sohn) 4x5 condenser
enlarger but new enough to be supplied with a filter drawer. What would
the main arguments for cold light be from a print quality aspect? Can
you achieve something with cold light which you cannot achieve with a
tungsten condenser enlager? Maybe this has been discussed in this group
before; I don't know as I have not followed this group too long.

Dan,

Bergger makes a contact paper called Prestige Fine Art Silver Supreme but at
US$24.95 for 10 sheets I haven't brought my self to try it yet. It is also only
in semi-matte.

Is the the paper you were talking about or is there another coming from Bergger?

Get the $200 one.  Talk to Alan at Aristo.  He's a treasure trove of
information on the subject of spectral characteristics of light sources
and spectral sensitivity of papers.  And, he really does know what he's
talking about.

I was in the same situation some months ago when I was putting together an
8x10 enlarger.  The chunks for that get frighteningly expensive really
quick.  The standard V54-tubed 10x10 was $800 and the vc was $2300.  I got
the hopped up V54 tubed light and it's a beauty.  The other thing I did
was to match the color of my Chromega heads and did this with a sheet of
30cc of yellow.  I use Ilford MG filters under the lens.  There is no
image degredation whatsoever from using these filters under the lens 
(though by saying so I've probably just ignited another flame war from the
split-filter folks :-)  The speed of printing and the suppression of sust
are remarkeable.  My 8x10 will print a "typical" PMK negative to 16x20 in
about 16 seconds at f/32!  That's fast.  So fast, in fact, I put a 1 stop
ND filter above the diffusion glass.

So go for it.  Don't feel the need to overspend, though.

I *think* Bergger is supposed to be coming up with a newer one with the
glossy surface. That is what I was told when asking a few months ago. They
were supposedly having the problem of it being too fast, but it was also
supposed to be a competitor to Azo. If so, I would like to see it.


Plan on a Utah photo trip in August 2002. Brigham City Museum Gallery will
host a photographic show, The Great American West: The B&W Landscape.
It features the images of Dick Arentz, Paula Chamlee Tillman Crane, Chip
Hooper, Craig Law, Ray McSavaney, Barry Parsons, John Sexton, Dan Smith and
Michael A. Smith.
This a show you don't want to miss and a perfect time to visit Utah on your
vacation. Brigham City is in Northern Utah, about an hour North of Salt Lake
City, home of the Bear River
Migratory Bird Refuge and on the way to Yellowstone National Park.
If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me for information as
I am the curator of the show.

Thanks Dan,

It sure would  be nice to have another good contact paper on the market.
Imagine.... double weight, glossy surface, deep neutral blacks, takes
toning/bleaching beautifully, multiple grades or even variable contrast....

Ah but then we'd just argue over how to split filter print it!

I sure hope they bring it out anyway, it might be worth the argument.

Split filter print it that is!

All,

I would like to speed match different grades of VC paper using  a dichro
enlarger. I've read the Paul Buzi article in Photo Techniques and on his web
page but haven't performed the test yet.

Does anyone know if it is reliable?

Also I've been using the dichro settings recommended by the paper
manufacturer which in the case of Ilford paper use both Magenta and Yellow
filtration for most grades for the most extreme grades. Is it feasible to
speed match with mixed filter settings.

I've also thought about measuring the color of VC filters and then trying to
match them with the dichro head. Has anyone tried this? Irealize I may not
have enough dichroic magenta filteration to match the grade 5 filtration of
the grade 5 VC filter but I should be able to match other grades.

Thanks,

Don Bryant

Don,

You missed my last teasing specification -- that it be VC!

Alas the arguing part is all too true.

Wow - fodder for another "discussion!"

I would guess that Buzi is correct and that this method is just fine.  You
do realize that it results in split printing, don't you?  The only
difference is that you make the two exposures simultaneously instead of
separately.  I think this is where you also get to dial in a little of
that lonely cyan...just to throw a little ND into the mix to keep printing
times matched.  The whole scheme reminds me of those people who drive with
one foot on the gas and the other on the brake - you know them...you can
watch their brake lights go on while they go up hills or accelerate from
a stop light. They indeed get to where they're going just like the rest of
us.  But something's just got to make you ask yourself just "why?"

You know, as you are working up to your final print - where you've made a
test and you are just adding a little more yellow or magenta - as dictated
by the negative - on the final go-'round you should be able to tweak the
number of CCs aand the exposure time to hit it right on.  When you start
doing Buzi's method, you are adding so much density to the mix that you
run the risk of ridiculous printing times.  I'm a real proponent of glass
carriers and if you don't use them your negative WILL pop.  Yes, even with
a dichro head.  Mine do it all the time (Chromegas).  So, if you must go
the filter pack route, think about getting a glass carrier if you want
sharpness without the BS of pre-heating/popping the negative on each
exposure and constant rechecking of the focus.  In fact, if you cherish
shrpness, get a glass carrier whatever you do.

  A few years ago I tried to work up speed-matched dichro filtration; I got
it to work, but exposures were _minutes_.....
  So much for that.

Don, \I was conducting the Buzi tests but getting
inconsistent results. It turned out to be due to an
enlarger filtration problem. I've since upgraded to a
Saunders LPLG and will be redoing the tests so I am
interested in any experiences you may have. One
question I have is how do you determine which setings
correspond the set grades? Is there a standard? Can I
print a step tablet and say "yes, this is grade 2" ?

That is the same enlarger as I have (I'm assuming that the LPLG is the 4x5
model).

I'm just using the settings recommended by the paper manufacturers for each
grade. For example Ilford lists 2 filter settings for each grade for a
dichro head. One that uses one color only and one that uses magenta and
yellow (except at the ends of the paper grade scale). I refer to those.

> Is there a standard? Can I

The number of steps that are counted determines the grade. I reccomend Steve
Anchel's book on VC paper. It has this information and more. I'll look it up
this weekend and post it here if you wish.

Don

I've been using a two-bath combination recommended by Creative monochrome - 
Dokulith and Centrabrom S. Results have been very pleasing both with 
fiber-based and RC. However, I've been told that the combination has 
drawbacks in that one of the developers is a 'warm' developer; the other 
'cooler.

Can anyone comment and/or suggest other developer combinations ?

I've very much enjoyed tuning in to the conversations since subscribing in 
November. Happy Christmas to all.

Two baths. First Centrabrom S which is a soft developer providing 'smooth' 
tones when printed on my normal grade 2 with Durst 138 condenser enlarger - 
lovely mid-tones and highlights. Dokulith then deepens the blacks. I'm using 
in conjunction with Barry Thornton's DiAxotol film developer with FP4 (35mm 
and 12O) and HP5 (120 AND 5 by 4.

  I think you will have better results by choosing a few formulas you want
to experiment with and getting the necessary chemicals for them. I would
also get relatively small amounts to begin with. Get larger amounts when
and if you decide to continue mixing your own. 
  For small volumes packaged developers are probably more economical than
mixing from bulk. However, that said mixing your own is fun and instructive.
  Some chemicals are almost universal. 
Sodium Sulfite, anhydrous
Sodium Carbonate, monohydrated (it comes in other forms but the
monohydrated form is the most stable.)
Potassium Bromide
Borax
Boric Acid (crystaline)
Sodium Metaborate (Kodalk)
Sodium Hydroxide is used in a few developers but don't get it unless you
need it.
Metol (a very common developing agent)
Hydroquinone (another very common developing agent)
  Metol and hydroquinone are used in combination to make a very wide range
of developers.
Acetic Acid, Glacial, for stop baths and fixing baths. (very cheap)
Some intesting developing agents are very expensive and hard to find now.
Among them are:
Amidol (makes an excellent paper developer)
Glycin (for warm tone paper developers and some film developers, very
expensive stuff)
  For fixing baths you need either 
Sodium Thiosulfate (standard fixing baths) or
Ammonium thiosulfate (rapid fixing baths. This is less stable as a powder
than the sodium variety)
Most old fixer formulas call for crystaline thiosulfate. The anhydrous form
is more widely used now. A bath calling for crystaline hypo can be made by
using about 64% of the amount given of anhydrous hypo. 
Get two books:
_The Darkroom Cookbook_ 
_The Film Developing Cookbook_ Both by Steve Anchell. Has loads of formulas
of all sorts.
  I have some even more obscure ones but, to be blunt, for reliable results
the plain vinilla Kodak formulas are about the best, with a couple of old
Agfa/Ansco ones thrown in (like Ansco 130). Nearly anything can be done
with metol-hydroquinone.
  Some more recent developers use Phenidone. This was a proprietary agent
devised by Ilford. Kodak came up with a more stable version which they sell
as Dimezone (not the cheap rides at Dizzyland). This is the main agent in
Xtol and even Ilford uses in currently rather than the original Phenidone.
  I posted the formula for Xtol given in the patent recently to the
rec.photo.darkroom group, you should be able to find it via Deja.com  I'll
post it here if its hard to find. 
  This is the patent literature version but the MSDS suggests its close to,
if not exactly, the packaged stuff. Probably much cheaper to buy it than to
make it. 
  You will also need a good balance type scale, although they can be
makeshifted; the required accuracy is not very high. Scales are often
available at police auctions of seized material, they get them from dope
dealers. 
  Have a well-ventillated place to work, put in a supply of nitrile gloves,
and a good apron. Some materials, notably Amidol and Pyrogallic Acid are
prodigeous stainers, you want to keep them off yourself and cloths, the
stains don't come out. 
  There are many other chemicals which are used in some formulas, Silver
Nitrate for some toners and for some intensifiers, for example. Again, pick
a couple of formulas to experiment with and get what you need for them
rather than trying to stock a whole chemical shelf at once. 
 Photo chemicals are available from several sources, most of which have
on-line catalogues. Shop price and beware that some chemicals must be
shipped as hazardous substances, which substantially increases their cost.
Make sure you know the shipping costs before finalizing your order:
http://www.bostick-sullivan.com/
http://www.montana.com/formulary/index.html

http://www.nfinity.com/~mdmuir/artcraft.html
http://www.tri-esssciences.com
/
Some organic chemicals are available from:
http://www.ChemicalLab.com/
  Phone numbers and addresses are available
from the web sites. 
 Tri-S doesn't have an on line catalogue yet buy will send you a list of
photo chemicals which they carry and other literature relating to chemical
safety. 
  Just as I am mailing this I realized that you are in France. The general
advise holds but the above sources may not be useful to you. I don't know
about sources outside of the US. 
  I am sure others on this list can help with this, along with other
suggestions about what to get.

There is another chemical supply, called FotoChem....... I believe you can 
access it via http://www.FotoChem.com...... am not sure it compares to 
Photographers Formulary in pricing, but at least it is another outlet. Please 
note that prices are in US dollars, as stated on their home page.

I've dealt with FotoChem for some years. Their prices on the things I've
bought have been roughly half to a third less than Formulary.  Originally
they only dealt in cash but now they take credit cards. It's a one man
operation and it sometimes takes a while to get the chemicals (two weeks or
so) but I've been pleased with them (or him).

Frank,

You do not say whether the fog level is even. If it occurred as a result of turning on the lights the fogging would be uneven.  The end of the film nearest the open end of the tube would be seriously fogged compared to the opposite end of the film. I do use BTZS tubes and was very sceptical of the method relating to removing the cap to dumping the developer and place the tube into the stop bath. I tried it, with a test exposure such was my scepticism, and to my surprise I had no fogging problems, or any other for that matter. I was also concerned about possible problems with the anti halation backing on the film but to date I have had perfect results, with the process that is, but sadly not with the subjects photographed. 

Your procedure is slightly different from mine, perhaps it may help if I describe mine.

Load film in the dark

Develop film with lights on. (1 60w bulb about 10 feet away from developing tray)

At the end of development with light still on I remove the cap, quickly dump the developer, and place tube in a developing tray full of stop bath. In doing so I scoop the stop bath into the open tube. Repeat with all tubes being used.

When developer has been dumped from the last tube I remove the film from each of  the tubes in the stop bath tray and place in tray of film fixer for the required time. The light is left on during the whole of this procedure. 

To date I have had no problems with fogging.

I hope this is of some help

Les McLean

I must have done something wrong.....my fog level was way out of line.  My
darkroom does not leak light, at least I am OK loading CFH in there. so it
must be OK for loading the Tubes....

Proceedure....
In the dark, load the tubes.
Place developer in the spare caps
In the dark, place tubes with film on top of the caps
Turn on room lights
Turn over the tubes, start timer
Keep spinning tubes till timer times out
In the dark, dump developer, put tubes ( open) in the stop bath)
let them sit for about a minute, spinning constantly,,,, no lights are
on....
Turn on room lights, remove film and place in the fixer..... tray.....
10 minute fix... etc....

Stop is 1 ounce of Glacial Acedic acid in 2 Liters of water ( 1:70 )

So what did I do to get the high level of fog that came from this
proceedure?

Should I have fixed in the dark?

I have always questioned Phil's methods when it comes to turning on the lights
as he does. I say leave then off till after one minute (minimum) of fix. I do
the whole fix time in the dark. Every other reference I have seen says it is
only the fix which removes the still sensitive silver from the film. The risk
is just not worth turning lights on sooner.

Georges,  I would recommend the Cookbooks by Anchell, The 
Darkroom Cookbook, and the Film developing Cookbook.  Sodium 
Sulfite, Sodium Carbonate, and Potassium Bromide will get 
you in to many formulas.  Metol, Phenidone, Hydroquinone 
(sp), Citric Acid would get you home (fulfill) on many. 
There are many others that will complete the formulas for 
film and paper processing.  This is a quick list, many I'm 
sure will add others.

Artcraft is also a one man show and I have never had a 
problem with Mike.  If he knows where to send you to get 
what you need, for those items that he does not carry, he is 
quick to give you a name.

Les McLean wrote the following and my answer is below:

Barry,

As the person you have been trying to needle for some months now I think
that it is time that I responded to your misleading and incorrect
allegations. I do think that you should have had the courage to name names
instead of hiding behind the vague description "seminar lecturer" as used in
your posting of 15th December. I have deliberately avoided making a reply to
your "needling" as I feel that this excellent forum is about photography and
not personalities. Your continued veiled attacks have left me with no
alternative but to defend myself and my reputation as a printer and teacher.

I have never claimed magical results from split grade printing, that is your
incorrect description of one of many ways of approaching the making of a
fine print. During the past few months you have asked me to post my method,
I did this some months ago and can only assume that you either missed it or
did not understand it.  I am not in the habit of evading questions or
issues. Ask anyone who has approached me on any issue.

In the 15th December posting you referred to "standing at the back of
several classes with the seminar lecturer", presumably myself. I can recall
only one seminar of mine where you stood at the back. That would be Focus at
the NEC in Birmingham 2 or perhaps 3 years ago when you introduced yourself
at the end of a 1.5 hour long demonstration during an Ilford Masterclass. I
recall your parting words were " you have shown me how to make prints from
old negatives that I have never managed to print before". I was only
demonstrating very basic split grade printing that day. Strange statement
from a printer who does not believe in the method.

I do not and never have claimed that split grade printing is the only way of
making prints, merely that it does offer certain benefits when a particular
type of negative is produced. In my workshops I do teach all methods of
print making using graded as well as VC papers and all methods of print
development. Not the approach of a "zealot" as you have described split
graders in recent postings.

You talk of me teaching "basic amateur photographers"  who treat my word as
gospel. I find this quite insulting not only to myself but more importantly
to the many amateur photographers who are at present hoping to get a copy of
your latest book in their Christmas Stocking. Your words seem to me to imply
that amateur photographers are somewhat inferior beings, how wrong you are.
For the record and for those who do not know me, in addition to teaching
amateur photographers I do teach degree Courses in Universities and Art
Colleges on both sides of the Atlantic.

Barry, perhaps I can suggest that you leave personalities out of postings in
future there is no gain for anyone in such entries least of all the
subscribers to a very informative and stimulating news group. Your methods
work for you and mine for me let us agree to disagree and get on with this
wonderful obsessive thing called photography.

To all other subscribers to this list please accept my apologies for
subjecting you to this posting. I hope that you understand my reasons and
that I had to answer what was being said about me.

Les McLean


Les
As I had already unsubscribed from pure-silver I did not receive your
message. Another member of the list was kind enough to mention it to me and
forward a copy - hence this delayed response.
For the record, I did NOT make the posting of which you complain to the
forum. It went to an individual off-list, and I was displeased to see it
appear subsequently on the forum. If you should doubt this, please note the
subject line of the forum posting. Along with receipt of a very unpleasant
message from another list member on another subject, this occurrence it
caused me to unsubscribe.
What had happened was that in a further upsurge of the discussion on split
grade printing versus single exposure printing (NOT instigated by me), I had
used an unfortunate phrase to which another member of the list objected. He
emailed me off list. I felt his complaint justified and emailed an apology,
also off list. In it I explained that my purpose in using the phrase I did
had been to elicit a response from someone else. This was the off-list
message that was then published to the list.
The word 'needle' was used in this personal email. The message had been a
very rushed one dashed off in a few seconds before hurrying out to an
imminent appointment. The word was a bad choice, which I regret, and I did
not mean it in the sense that comes across. For that I am sorry. I had meant
the sense of 'elicit' a response. You are a very well known protagonist of
split grade printing here, and your input would have been healthy and
welcome.
While you were right in thinking that you were the person I had in mind, you
are ABSOLUTELY wrong in attributing anything personal to the message. Again,
for the record, there is nothing personal - quite the contrary. You are an
enthusiastic presenter and writer doing much to inspire and encourage
photographers to work in monochrome. I am more than pleased that you are
active in this role.
You and I have different methods of working. So what? It doesn't mean I am
in some way 'attacking' you personally, or that there is unfriendliness, or
that I don't respect you and your right to your views. There is no need to
reiterate your experience and status.
The whole point is that for the vitality and health of our valuable pursuit,
that could so easily die under the advancing flood tide of purely digital
techniques, or become the domain of a few ultra-conservative head-in-sand
die-hards, we NEED continuing questioning - even argument - but not
fractious dispute. The pure-silver forum is a great place for silver
photographers of the world to use, ironically, digital technology to
maintain inspiration and skill across continents in a way hitherto not
possible.
To answer some specifics:
	I have seen you present on three occasions. On only one did I introduce
myself. You wouldn't have known me if I hadn't. On each you have extolled
the virtues of split grade printing and I believe at each you have suggested
that it does produce results not possible with non-split grade printing, in
the same way that you suggest there is a difference between post and pre
flashing. I continue to meet on my own workshops and seminars people who
have attended yours who believe that split grade printing will produce tones
not available by the non-split route and quote you as saying that. They may
have misunderstood you. There is a remarkable consistency in their comments.
	The thrust of your presentations has been to get a good print from a
difficult negative, whereas my own approach is to achieve a fine negative
which will print more easily and to a higher standard I believe. No problem
there - just a different approach. On no occasion have I made the remark you
attributed to me about your showing me how to print difficult negatives. I
did, however, comment on the type of negatives from which you were printing.
You have written about your preference for a high contrast negative on more
than one occasion, and said so in the presentations I saw you make.
	You speak of my 'continued veiled attacks' on you. That is just silly.
Indeed your whole message has shades of "methinks he doth protest too much"
about it. I haven't made any 'attack' on you. All I have done is to suggest
that the split filter printing technique you prefer may not be a superior
method. That's to question your beliefs, not 'attack' you. They are also the
beliefs of a good number of other pure-silver correspondents. We are
discussing the technique, not 'attacking' one another. My guess would be
that I am in a distinct minority on the issue. I did ask you to explain your
support for the system, which you did. Readers can come to their own
conclusion. However...
	In your seminars I clearly heard you say that you felt that a contrasty
negative was 'self masking', and indeed you wrote in a pure-silver email
"the simple fact is that if the negative has enough overall contrast, and
density in the highlights then it becomes a mask and in effect dodges for
you while you are exposing, particularly the hard filtration". I am
genuinely puzzled by and interested in this, and I think other pure-silver
members would be too. I have asked you four times over about 12 months to
expand on it. You did not respond. I consequently let it drop. But this
couldn't possibly be construed as a 'veiled attack' - it was a simple, and
courteous, request for information.
	Your suggestion that I regard 'basic amateur photographers' as 'inferior
beings' is also just silly. It is an old old debating technique to attribute
to the person with whom you debate a view which they did not express, then
knock it down. That is what you have done. There isn't the slightest
suggestion that I regard amateur photographers as inferior. I don't. Full
stop. Basic amateur photographers without long experience and acquisition of
knowledge often do take the word of celebrities such as you as gospel.
Experienced ones will make up their own minds. I value ANY photographer,
those working in monochrome in particular. In fact I value people.

And because of that, can we please put this spat behind us? Please accept
that there is no ill feeling or unfriendliness towards you - quite the
contrary. That makes it even more regretful that this episode should have
blown up. If we get the opportunity - at Focus for instance - let's go and
have a beer together and enjoy our mutual pursuit.

Cheers
Barry Thornton

AFAIK there seems no obvious way you should be getting any fogging with
your procedure as stated. Once the film is in an acid stop bath (and then
been tranferred to the fixer your film) is in an acidified solution. There
is (also) not enough carry-over of the developer to continue development
(unless you are using Amidol) and there should be no further development.

Before seeking a solution (no pun intended) to your development procedure,
may I suggest you load a sheet of film in the film holder, insert it in the
camera, remove the darkslide for (say) 30 seconds, and, without any
"shutter/lens" exposure, replace the slide and repeat your processing
steps. You may have a light leak in the bellows, or as happened to me one
day... the leansboard was not properly "seated"... or, could it be that the
film was fogged before it went into the filmholders.. this has also
happened to me....

Over the years, I have also received the occasional "new" film that has
unacceptable levels of fogging due to improper storage... exposure to
x-rays.... and the one that really stumped me for a while... a "bad"
changing bag.

Let us know how things go

Ken

That sounds depressing, what method did you use to speed match?

Anchel's VC paper book suggests uses an exposure factor based on matching
highlight densities. Perhaps this approach is more practical.

I'm sure I speak for others in hoping that a vigourous debate will end with 
re-newed friendship. Some of my best friends were once keen - and 
constructive - antagonists. I don't have the privilege of knowing Les, but 
I'm sure that he is as dedicated and enthusiastic towards photographers of 
all abilities as I know Barry is from personal experience. We do need such 
high quality people as Les and Barry to help us all progress and enjoy the 
most fantastic interest/hobby/ life style !!!

Happy Christmas

The way that I hear most folks explain split filtered printing, the above
stated method doesn't fall within that definition strictly speaking. That
is, make one exposure at maximum soft filtration and then another exposure
at maximum hard filtration. But ignoring that, yes using simultaneous dual
filtration can be considered to be split filtered printing.

Also I seem to remember that Buzi had a follow up column that refuted the
notion of using cyan filtration to achieve ND in the filter pack since the
paper is blind to cyan colored light. Is this correct?

All,

Last night I tried some of the Gaveart G-262 warm toned paper developer
recently discussed here on the list.

I tried three papers to see how the developer would affect the color of the
print. Ilford warm tone, Ilford MG IV, and Oriental Seagull. All FB VC
papers.

Much to my surprise the Ilford MG IV looked as though it had grey measles.
The print through out the exposed areas was mottled. Has this paper gone
bad. This happened to once several years ago with Kodak Fine Art paper but
I've kept all of my paper refrigerated. Any thoughts?

Don Bryant

Lately my 35mm negs start curling like mad as soon as I take them down after
drying and staying that way instead of flattening out like they used to.

I usually let them hang in the darkroom with the ventilation fan on for a
couple of hours.  After cutting them up and putting them into sleeves I
place them under several old phone books overnight.  Usually they are fine
the next day. 

The last few rolls I've developed have curled up and stayed that way even
after holding them under the phone books for several nights.

My 120 negs never had this problem and are still fine.

Any thoughts?  My process is developer/kodak stopbath/illford fixer/wash for
one min/one min in Heico readywash/wash for another couple of minutes/kodak
photo-flo and hang 'em up.

I'm not sure I understand what you mean when you say the fog level was too
high. However, FWIW, you actually don't even need to put the tubes in the
stop bath in the dark, as long as the room light is fairly dim, so I doubt
that fixing in the light was the problem unless conceivably it was very
bright - say 100 watts or more - and was within a couple feet of the tray.
>From what you've described,  I don't think the fog is caused by your
processing procedure. I've used the same procedure for years (except that I
turn on a dim room light after the film goes in the tubes with the developer
and it stays on the rest of the time, including when the tubes go in the
stop). The light is a 50 watt bulb that is behind me and about six or eight
feet from the pan and trays. Conceivably there is some sort of light leak in
the tubes themselves, which seems unlikely given their construction and it
really seems unlikely that all of them would have the same leak. However,
even that faint possibility could be eliminated by developing in the dark
one time and seeing whether you still get the fog.

To each his own but as I said in response to the original message, I've been
using the tubes for about five years now and I always leave a dim light on
at all times, including the stop stage, once the developer is in the tubes.
I've never had any adverse effects.  I'm pretty sure Phil knows what he's
talking about on this one.

I want to thank everyone for their suggestions to date....Let me clear some
mis-communication....

The edges are fogged.... when I say badly, I am stating something like zone
5 or 6.  Maybe higher.  The film was fogged.
The film happened to come from 2 different manufacturers, so it is not the
film.
The camera has been used before, and does not leak, and even if it did leak,
the edges would not be affected ( too much) and the fogging would not have
been consistent across the neg....
The developer did a good job of developing all the neg, no streaking, no
problems I could tell.  It was D76 used straight... ( Super D76 from a
liquid by NACCO.)  It was a new bottle, so I have no data on its actual
performance.
My darkroom is about 5x8 feet to the walls ( a recycled closet).  I only
wish I could out the light in the room 10 feet away! ( My jealousy showing!)

The only conslusion I can come to is that I did not get the stop acid either
strong enough or mixed well enough to acidify the developer, arresting all
development.....I got fogging because I turned on the lights before the
acidification took place.

There is another possibility that my fix was not strong enough or used up,
but I doubt this because the fogging by light  should have been stopped by
the stop bath... the fix only chemically stabilizes the image.. Maybe a long
term effect, but certainly not a 45 second effect...

The next step is to take some test shots ( and a control test of a sheet of
film directly from the box to the tubes,) and develop again.  I am going to
try the same proceedure I used the "fateful" time, to see if it is a stop
issue.  If that fails, then I must modify my proceedure...maybe carry out
all steps in the dark.  But this should not be needed, and others' actual;
use of the tubes tells me it should not be needed, at least not to the
degree I am seeing fogging.

One cause of paper "measles" is cold paper. If your paper is dated okay,
likely this was the cause. It takes hours to warm up a full box of paper. I
don't recall the exact warm-up times: check with the manufacturer. Taking
the paper out of refrigeration the night before is a good procedure. If you
remember and know that far in advance you'll be printing :).

  That's what I did with lots of trial and error. I didn't see much point
in speed-matching using a midtone.
  And then....different enlarger, different paper, and I found it much more
productive to just wing it. <g>

I don't know of any recanting by Butzi on the cyan filtration but the
whole idea of keeping a constant speed requires the use of the cyan.
Whether the paper is "blind" to the cyan or not, the combination causes a
gray light and simple reduction in output.  Please, someone, correct me
here if I'm wrong.

I just went into my darkroom and tested a simple mid-range filter pack of
Butzi's with my Chromega head and it cost me more than 3 full stops of
light compared to usinf the typical 10 to 20cc of yellow or magenta that I
ever need to use.

Merry Christmas, happy holidays to all.

Oh, PS - Howard Bond did a piece on fine control of contrast with VC
papers in the Sept/Oct 1999 issue of PhotoTechniques, FWIW.  One other
thing to keep in mind - and I'm not trying to instigate anything here:  I
have no aversion to using filters under my lenses.  This seems to be a
hang up for some.  Even under magnification, I have neve been able to see
any image degredation from their use.

  I always think of the South as sunny and hot with magnolias blooming. Its
even cold here in LA, though people here don't know what _real_ cold is,
except for transplants from the mighty middle west, like me. 
  Cyan is minus red, that is, its all colors but red. Since increasing cyan
filtering simply removes more and more red light, and since VC paper is not
sensitive to red, it should have little effect on overall transmission
although it may have the _visual_ effect of darkening the image on the easel.
 VC paper has two emulsion compenents; one sensitive to blue light, the
other sensitive to both blue and green. The gross sensitivity of the two
are not the same. When printing with primarily blue light both compenents
are exposed, so the total density is the composite of both. When green
light is used only the green sensitive component is exposed, lowering the
contrast. 
  Blue and Green filters can be used for printing, however, visual
brightness is better if color difference filters are used. These are yellow
(passes green but not blue) and magenta (passes red and blue but not
green). Using electronic terminology, the printing filters are band-stop
filters rather than band pass filters. 
  Since magenta blocks green and yellow blocks blue combining them will
block both. So, combining them in the right way will result in both a color
selection effect and a transmission reduction effect. Since an ideal cyan
filter does not affect either blue or green (its a red stop filter) it
would have no effect whatever other than chaging the _visual_ intensity of
the projected image (since the eye is sensitive to red as well as blue and
green).

Maybe you're calling fog level what is over development.

I tray develop and do more than I should at a time.  Sometimes I drop sheets
on the floor and take them up after the rest have gone through stop and fix
for one minute; then into the fix in dim light and they reamin developed
without fog.

Thanks Phil Davis for his reassurance that dim light won't fog after
devleopment.

Gosh, Richard, this was such a good year in so many respects wishing for a
better 2001 to me seems like asking for the moon.

I'm incredibly grateful for the one now winding to a close and would be
quite content if next year even comes half as close.

Easily pleased in Maryland,

John Rogers

I just received my order for a DiXactol kit from
Photographers Formulary this week, and anxious to try
it out I processed a roll of film I had lying around.
It was a roll of 120 taken on the roof of the building
at work - midday cloudy cityscape shots, intersting
sky but high contrast. For the sake of economy and
ease I used the single bath technique. I used a
multiple rinse out stop technique instead of using a
chemical stop (is this a mistake?). For fixer I used
Ilford Rapid Fix.

The negatives have a lot of detail in the sky which I
am very impressed by. Unfortunately throughout the
negatives I have small pinholes in the emulsion. I can
tell they are pinholes, rather than from dust prior to
exposure because the clear areas of film still have
stain, while these little defects are absolutely stark
clear. I've processed umpteen rolls of TMY (this film)
in Xtol and I have never seen this before. Is there
some aspect of emulsion fragility I should know about
when using DiXactol? 

Also I am curious to know exactly what sort of
differences I would have seen if I had used the 2 bath
technique. Would there be even more separation in the
sky? More grain? Less grain? More stain? Less stain?
Clearly the economy isn't that good with the 2 bath
technique. I was actually shocked at how little
chemical is actually used in the process (12 cc and 2
cc in 500 cc). I honestly expected to see nothing.
These must be some pretty concentrated developing
chemicals. 

Any advice on how I can get the most out of this
excellent developer would be most appreciated.

Having organised a workshop here in Exeter UK where Barry Thornton taught 6 
of us over a weekend, I'm very much a Thornton fan. He is a passionate man 
who pulls no punches and an excellent teacher in my view.

I use DiAxotol with FP4 and Delta 100 in 35mm and also with HP5 in 120. i 
use the single bath with a very dilute stop (Ilfostop) and an alkaline fix 
(Agefix by Agfa). I've got terrific negatives rating the films at one half 
stop lower than the manufacturers' recommendations.

The non-acid environment is important - just maybe your fix has caused the 
pinholes.I've not tried two-bath myself partly because i've been so content 
with the one bath which has given me incredibly printable - and consistent - 
negatives.

Of course, Barry is the man to talk to and i've found him amazingly patient 
and open in his advice and whole attitude. i stronly recommend you give him 
a call or e-mail.

Best wishes

I'll have to try a non-acid fix. Interestingly I've
never had a problem using the rapid fix even with an
acid stop when using Xtol - these DiXactol negatives
overall seem to be nicer, although I haven't gone to
the darkroom yet.

Do you have any recommendations for an alkaline fix?
Can I "doctor" up the Rapid Fix I have?

-Josh

Snipping here...

    Agefix is NOT an alkaline fixer. Rather it is a conventional ammonium
thiosulfate hardening fixing bath. You can tell acid fixers because they
feel "sticky" when you feel them with your fingers. 
    Ilford stop bath is a Citric acid bath rather than Acetic acid. This
has some advantages in that it has low or no odor. Although Citric acid
iterferes with hardening somewhat by binding aluminum the effect is not
great enough to cause any real problem.
  Alkaline solutions are desirable with Pyro developers to eliminate the
bleaching effect of the acid on the stain. The stain can be re-generated by
treating the negatives in a solution of sodium carbonate, or other alkaly,
or even Dektol print developer, after its fixed and before washing. 
 It is possible for an acetic acid stop bath to cause pin holes due to
carbon dioxide evolved when used with a carbonate containing developer.
This effervesence can sometimes be heard as a slight sizzling or hissing
when prints are put in the stop bath. I don't know what Barry uses as the
accellerator in DiXactol but none of the large company packaged film
developers on the market contains carbonates. They use Borax based
accellerators like Borax or Metaborate, neither of which evolves gas. Print
developers, like Dektol contain carbonate. Ektonol, BTW, is a borax based
print developer with no carbonate. 
  While there is a vogue for using completely alkaline processing there is
really no very good reason for it except for color films where the acid
decolorizes the dyes. Pyro stain, which is, BTW, not a dye, but rather a
pigment, can be regenerated in an alkaline bath, as noted above.
  T-Max films have very hard emulsions. They are similar to color films,
which are designed to be processed at 100F. They may even contain some
plastic in the emulsion, as many color films do. 
  Clear spots need to be carefully examined with a strong magnifier to see
what they are. True pin-holes are mechanical disruptions of the emulsion;
they are actually very rare. Even with carbonate developers and Acetic
acid, pin holes rarely occur. It is more likely that there was some
impurity stuck to the film, perhaps some component of the developer in fine
particles. The developer should be filtered to remove any particulate
matter. Although dust has evidently been eliminated as a possible cause its
a good idea to look at the edge printing on the film to see if the clear
spots show up there also. They would not be affected by dust but would be
affected just as the image by particulate matter or from very fine bubbles. 
  Generally bubbles, or air-bels, are not pin hole sized by larger.
Typically they are clear with darker lines around them from edge effects.
  I hope this is of some help. I think the effect of gas in making pin
holes is very much exagerated.

  There is no way you can turn an acid fixing bath into an alkaline one.
  According to Gordon Huchings, in his book _The Book of Pyro_ acid fixers
are OK, it is the hardener which reduces the stain. Ilford fixers do not
contain hardeners. Kodak Rapid Liquid Fixer with Hardener also can be used
as a non-hardeninig fixer by simply leaving out the hardener, which is in a
separate container.
  Non acid fixers can be made as follows:
A plain fixing bath is simply 240 grams of crystaline thiosulfate in 1
liter of water. If anhydrous thiosulfate is used the amount is 154 grams.
 Plain fixing baths oxidize very rapidly, a better alkaline fixing bath is:
Water				750ml
Sodium Thiosulfate		240 grams
Sodium Sulfite, anhydrous	15 grams
Sodium Metaborate (Kodalk)	10 grams
Water to make			1.0 liter

If anhydrous thiosulfate is used the amount is 154 grams/ liter
If crystaline thiosulfate is used the water should be quite hot, 125F.
Crystaline thiosulfate is very endothermic and will lower the temperature
of the water considerably as it goes into solution.
If anhydrous thiosulfate is used the water should be warm but not hot, not
over 90F, to prevent sulfurization. 
 Again, the use of alkaline fixers is not really necessary since any loss
of stain can be made up by soaking the fixed and rinsed film in either used
Pyro developer or simply in an alkaline bath. 
  Note: Anchell and Troop make some statements about fixing baths in _The
Film Developing Cookbook_ which are simply not true. They state, for
instance, that an acid fixing bath extends washing time by mordanting
thiosulfat to the silver crystals. This is a confounding of something else;
potassium aluminum alum hardener does bind thiosulfate to the emulsion in a
narrow range of pH. Actually, the pH at which the hardening action is
greatest is just out of this range. In any case, the mordanting effect, if
that is what it is, is completely eliminated by treating the emulsion with
either an alkaline bath or a sulfite wash aid. The wash aid is the most
effective.
  Kodak research labs investigated this problem several times, the earliest
(of whihc I am familiar) was published in the early thirties. They found
that the pH of the emulsion made little difference in washing rate although
washing was fastest when the emulsion was at its isoelectric point. Chrome
alum (potassium chromium alum) hardener, which must work at a considerably
lower pH than aluminum sulfate, had virtually no effect on washing rate. or
does the hardness of the gelatin seem to affect washing rate very much.
  In short, for B&W processes there seems to be no good reason to abandon
conventional acid stop baths and acid hardening fixing baths and some good
reasons for keeping them.

Joshua, my comments apply to 120 size TMX.

The only time I have had pinholes with TMX100
and single bath DiXactol was when I used a rubber
bladed wiper to wipe the film down. There must have
been a very small particle of grit on the film or
wiper blade. It didn't scratch but punched very small
holes in the emulsion. The giveaway was a line of holes
as the grit rolled down the film.
Have a look at the emulsion side of the film under a
high power magnifier with very oblique lighting. If
the pinhole is due to mechanical damage then you should
be able to see the torn emulsion or a step around the
pinhole. Also the edge of the hole will be very abrupt.
If it's due to particles in the developer I'd expect to
see some softening of the edge due to developer
diffusion under the edge of the particle.

(Since you say the hole is clear with no stain the
following comment probably doesn't apply. Because the
developer is a tanning one an area of light density
in a darker region will show a step due to differential
hardening of the emulsion even if there is no
mechanical damage.)

Maybe the best clue to the cause is the shape of the
pinhole and how sharp it's edge is.

Although I use a water rinse now, in the past I've
used Ilfostop Citric acid stop without pinholes
forming. I don't know about Acetic acid.
I didn't use it because I wanted to maximise the stain.
Fixer was/is Ilfofix non hardening. I've tried alkaline
fixers but couldn't see any difference in the final stain
after a long wash. I use a sodium metaborate bath
(1/2 teaspoonful per litre) after fixing rather than used
developer. Just make sure the sodium metaborate is fully
dissolved, if it's not you get small brown specks of
stain on the film.

My experience has been that two bath gives more
highlight compensation-compression, slightly mushier
grain and is not quite so sharp looking as the single
bath. It's still very sharp though! It also looks as
if it gives less visible stain for negatives developed
to give the same printing contrast (as single bath)
on graded paper.
I'd suspect due to reduced stain there would be less
difference between the grade of VC and Graded papers
needed to get the same contrast prints. I don't
know this though, I nearly always use single bath now.

I too was amazed at how little of developer Part A
is needed. In the UK it's possible to buy packs
of two bottles of Part B which is very useful if you
use single bath.

That would be useful. It seems I will eventually have
6 full bottles of A lying around if I continue to use
the single bath, which I probably will since it is
easier and I am impressed with the results.

I bought my 2 bottle packs of part B by mail order
directly from Barry Thornton. I don't remember seeing
any in the shops (such as Silverprint) in the UK. 6mths
ago they only had A+B packs on display.

I've used Agfa AGEFIX. Also, it is important to replace the developer for 
about 2 mins after fix (although this is not relevant to pinhole problems). 
I also wash the negs very thoroughly for at least 20 minutes. Barry is 
meticulous about using distilled water with the developer and clean spools 
etc. I've followed his craftmanship very carefully.

Sorry for the delay in responding. I was rather tied up with the festive
season.
My method of using "split filter printing" is as follows
1.  Produce a test strip of the negative using 70Y on my Durst colour head.
I cover the edge of the test strip during the exposure to give a "paper
white" comparison.
2. Process normally and determine which strip I consider the best for
highlight tonality.
3. Expose a 10x8 sheet at 70Y at the selected exposure.
4. Set colour head to 95M and expose a further series of test strips on the
10x8 sheet from (3) above. (Not forgetting to cover the first strip to
leave it as just 70Y).
5. Decide on the 95M exposure which gives the level of shadow detail I
require.
6. Make a print of two exposures, the first at the 70Y exp and the second at
the 95 M exp.
7. Decide on any burning and dodging and under which filter this should be.

I am only an average printer but can usually obtain an acceptable result in
two full prints. The 70Y and 95M filters were determined through tests to
give me the maximum highlight and shadow tones on MGIV. I would also say
that this procedure works best on negatives with full contrast.  Flat
negatives are best printed through a hard filter only in my opinion. I'm
sure there must be many variations on this method but it works for me.

Cheers  Bob

To try and answer your question with a general answer, split filter printing
is an attempt to make a silver gelatin print using multi-grade or variable
contrast paper to expand the range beyond a single grade of contrast range,
paper.

To answer the question about how to do this would be to answer another
question.  There *are* simple answers, though.

Ian,

The best advice that I can think of passing on is to contact Majia McDougal who is one of the best Bromoil workers that I know of in the UK. Majia is also a very good teacher and a workshop with her would give you a very good kick start in making Bromoils. She lives in Malvern which is not too far away from Exeter, her phone number is 01684 893520.  It is a wonderful process which I have enjoyed doing and regret that I cannot devote more time to it.

Ian,

I have used two bath print development for many years and obviously have my favourite combinations. One of them is Beers which you have mentioned. Selectol Soft and Dektol is another although my experience is that Selectol Soft stock solution tends to go off fairly quickly even when stored in a well sealed full bottle. Instead of purchasing it I prefer to make my own from raw chemicals so that I can make just enough for one printing session. My personal favourite combination is OD62 Hard developer and Gevaert G253 Soft. These cannot be purchased but if you make your own I will include the formula at the end of this posting. 

Might I suggest that you also experiment with different dilution, for example I often use a very strong hard bath and a very weak soft bath. As a guide to method, I use the hard bath first and remove the print as soon as the first tone appears and place it in the weak soft bath for the remainder of the development. Even though the print is removed from the hard bath before the deepest blacks have been established the print will still show good rich blacks at the end of the development. When the print is placed in the weak soft bath the development is quite slow and can take more than my normal development time of three minutes. However, you can soon work out the best development time by carrying out a few tests.  I have found that this method allows me total control over the development.

Formulae

OD62 Hard Print Developer

Metol                        2.5grms
Sodium Sulphite       30.0grms
Hydroquinone            6.0grms
Sodium Carbonate    45.0grms
Pot Brom 5% sol'n       5.0ml
Mix in 750ml water and make up to 1 litre
Normal Dilution1 to 1

G253 Soft Print Developer
Metol                        3.0grms
Sodium Sulphite      20.0grms
Sodium Carbonate   23.0grms
Bromide                     1.0grm

Mix as above
Normal Dilution    1 to 1

Try the following dilutions
OD62 stock solution
G253    1part developer to 4 parts water

Have fun
Les Mclean

Don...

Describe what the timer is doing vs what it shoul do.. then...

can you open it up or do you still have the manual?  If you can read the
part numbers, I will give you a lead on where to buy the parts.....

BTW, most of these were digital count down parts... 7590 should appear
somewhere on the part number... Now that was from memory, so.......

Read the directions first, then follow them before experimenting beyond what

I have used this with terrific results. With a graded paper ( such as 
Oriental Seagull G3 ) you can control the image contrast by more than a 
half of a grade (VC users take note)
by using a "soft" developer as the first bath and a "hard" developer as 
the second bath.
I used Selectol soft followed by Zone VI developer.
You divide the total developer time between the two baths- for example I 
normally develop my prints for three minutes. By developing for 1 1/2 
minutes in Selectol soft followed by 1 1/2 minutes in Zone VI I lower my 
contrast by 1/2 grade. Using 1 min in the first and 2 in the second 
increases contrast. While 2 minutes in the first and 1 minute in the 
second reduces contrast.
The prints I have made with this technique are perhaps my finest ever- 
the beauty and easy toning of the graded paper combined with the contrast 
control needed to capture just the right feel.

A question for those of you who live in the snow belt.

What are your thoughts on photographing snow?  Aside from wear a warm
jacket, dress in layers and stay dry of course.

It seems no matter how much I overexpose and underdevelop, and meter meter
meter, I get either a white blob or gray and chalky blob.  And the trees
usually come out as black sticks.  In other words, way too contrasty.

I can adjust VC paper by 1/4 grade (or more and see the difference) with a
dichro head and one developer. The fact that you can do this with two
developers is old news. Are you suggesting that graded OS paper is superior
to VC?

I'm not saying there is not some advantage to your method but this does
bring up the question. What are the advantages of graded paper over VC?
Better highlight or mid-tone seperation? Superior gradation?

<< What are your thoughts on photographing snow? >>

David,

I take very few winter photos - for a variety of reasons - but I usually seem 
to have very good luck.  Just last week, I shot some photos of my 
granddaughter and her daughter making snow-angels.  My granddaughter wanted 
them for her Christmas cards.  I shot them with Tri-X 120 Pro (from a tall 
stepladder !) late in the afternoon.  Nearly all of my snow pictures have 
been late afternoon, preferably with a slightly-clouded sun.  This gives a 
less contrasty shadow situation.  With the snow-angels, the thin tree shadows 
made a pattern of nice, subdued bands across the picture and the people.  By 
the way, I happened to be using the Tri-X because I was also doing some 
available light interior shots, and my old Hassy needs all the speed it can 
get chasing a two year old inside the house with a handheld camera and 
moderately slow lens.  I've looked back at earlier years' winter shots, and 
the cloudiness and indirect sun all seem to be involved in the best photos.  
By the way, I don't do any special metering or filtering for these particular 
photos (other than a polarizer, if any glare-y objects around).  I tend to 
meter for a midpoint based on a large expanse of lightly-shadowed area.  
However, I do rate and develop some of these films strangely.  I believe that 
I rated those most recent shots at about ASA 300 and then developed them in 
Acufine at recommended times plus 30%, or so.  Don't know why I do a lot of 
these things.  Experience, I guess.

OK. OK. It's not purely silver. However, snow scenes render beautifully in
this process. (Sometimes silver doesn't have all the answers - and this is
one subject matter that gelatin silver handles rather poorly, especially
cold-toned papers!)

Alternately (and to better stay "on message") - print the image soft enough
on GS to render detail and then split-tone it!  You might be surprised....

Good luck -

I had a similar problem originally and it put me off split filter printing.
But I eventually and some time ago now, slackened off slightly the friction
devices on the filter wheels and this seems to have cured the problem

Much the same results can be obtained, at least with some graded papers,  by
just using a water bath as the second bath. Saves you the time, trouble and
expense of buying, mixing, and storing a second batch of developers.

Selectol Soft and Dektol is another although my experience is that Selectol
Soft stock solution tends to go off fairly quickly even when stored in a
well sealed full bottle. Instead of purchasing it I prefer to make my own
from raw chemicals so that I can make just enough for one printing session.
My personal favourite combination is OD62 Hard developer and Gevaert G253
Soft. These cannot be purchased but if you make your own I will include the
formula at the end of this posting.

example I often use a very strong hard bath and a very weak soft bath. As a
guide to method, I use the hard bath first and remove the print as soon as
the first tone appears and place it in the weak soft bath for the remainder
of the development. Even though the print is removed from the hard bath
before the deepest blacks have been established the print will still show
good rich blacks at the end of the development. When the print is placed in
the weak soft bath the development is quite slow and can take more than my
normal development time of three minutes. However, you can soon work out the
best development time by carrying out a few tests.  I have found that this
method allows me total control over the development.

Fortunately, I now live in south Texas, and don't get a look at snow.
However, I lived for many years in Ohio and Michigan, and did my best to
take snow pictures, without success. My analysis is that if the sun is not
shining on the snow, leave your camera at home. You will not get anything.
The problem is that with snow under cloud cover, the light is extremely
even. During all the time I lived in the midwest, the sun very rarely shone
on fresh snow, and when it did, I was unable to get away to take pictures.

If you get sun on snow which is worth photographing, I suppose you would
follow Ansel Adams' suggestions on zone placement, if you are a black and
white zone system person. If not, use an incident light meter. If you have
to use a reflected light or through-the-lens meter, overexpose a couple of
stops. A yellow filter will probably help, if you are shooting black and
white.

Try this approach:

1) Set your ASA a stop slower than you usually do.  For example, my normal
   ASA for Agfapan APX100 is 50, in this case, it is 25.

2) Meter the *snow*, then open up *4-5* f stops.

3) Develop your film 30-40% *less* than usual.

This approach assumes a brightly lit day with brilliant whites coming off the
snow.  It is just an approximation, but ought to get you into the ballpark.

Mike ,  Perhaps your teacher needs to do some research. 
While others have mentioned Selectol Soft, i prefer Ansco120 
as my soft and ansco 130 as my hard developer.  As Les 
points out, altering the dilution of the developers you can 
further adjust the quality of the developer.  It has worked 
well for me recently on some seagull G3.

It will also change the color of the paper and affects how 
it tones; cooler, redder, warmer,  depends on paper and time 
in each combination so don't assume how these will work for 
important images.

To tone split development, place one tray with soft ahead of 
your hard developer. You can "play with" dilutions and times 
left in each bath to achieve many different tonal qualities 
with a single paper.   Have fun.

This brings up even more questions and sounds an awful lot like the split 
toning debate.
So here let me start it off- 
I think that graded papers do have superior gradation, and tone much more 
beautifully than any VC paper I have seen and to further stir the pot I 
think the finest prints  I have seen in person, by any photographers have 
been on graded paper.

Lots of people think VC is "just as good". Lots of people think RC is 
"just as good".
Some people think machine prints on color paper are "just as good"
but I digress......; )

You certainly have digrested! You still haven't answered my questions, even
anecdotally. I'm not refuting what you have said but I would like some
clarification and support for your statement. As it stands it is way to
subjective, at least for me to take at face value.

You are right- too subjective

How about the reverse statement-
"VC papers have better tonal gradation and produce superior prints to 
graded papers" 
-hmmmm

Thanks for being so civil- 
I  have seen many fine prints- W. Eugene Smith,Roy DeCarava,Michael 
Kenna, Weston,etc. that were produced on graded paper that seem to have a 
depth and luminosity that seems unsurpassed by any of the modern day VC 
papers- don't even get me started on RC papers.
Obviously many people are pleased with modern VC papers and many fine 
photographers use them. 
Yet when I go to museum or gallery shows and see a show done on graded 
papers,the images seem to have a sense of depth and quality that 
impresses instead of merely being competent.
All very subjective
Have I done side by side blind comparisons?- yes   I liked the graded 
better.double -blind? no 
Do I print with graded or VC?- both -mainly VC for my customers
mainly graded for myself.
Do I tone? yes- selenium and it works sooo  beautifully on graded papers. 
Some VC papers seem to have no response at all to selenium.
digressing away!  : )
What are your thoughts?

Back in art school, I too, used the Beer's formula on graded papers, (Agfa 
Brovira , and Portriga Rapid ) , and depending on your dilution proportions , 
you could get either a half grade higher(more contrast ) or half a grade 
lower (lowered contrast ), and I usually ended up printing on a grade 2 or 3. 
Beers formula gives VERY deep blacks . I used to dilute in concentrations of  
1:1: 1, that being equal parts of Solutions A , and B, to water, 

There is a downside to using Beers formula though, that being it has poor 
keeping qualities , less than 2 weeks .  I put my stock solutions into  
collapsible bottles called  Air Vacs(?), they are accordian pleated  plastic 
bottles that allow you to compress the bottle down to get rid of the air. If 
you use Beers , and wonder if it is exhausted , simply open it, the odor 
alone will tell you, it has the odor of dog's breath..

if you meter for the snow, it will come out gray, as the meters thinks it is 
18% gray, the meter is calibrated that way. To " fool " the meter, take a 
reading, then open up by 3 stops, sometimes 4, and then develop film for 
20-30% less , works every time for me. I also bracket some too.

  The effectiveness of two bath developing depends a lot on the kind of
emulsion involved. Modern chloro-bromide emulsions are pretty much fixed in
contrast regardless of development. Brovira was the last pure bromide
emulsion paper made. Bromide has some small range of contrast variation. 
  However, it should be pointed out that paper, unlike film, is developed
until the highest possible density is reached,i.e. "development to
completion". Film is rarely developed to the point of maximum density, it
is rather developed to a given gamma or contrast, the maximum density of
the negative being far less, in general practice, than the maximum density
of which the film is capable. The fact that paper is developed as far as
possible precludes having much control of contrast via development. The
contrast is pretty much fixed by the distribution of grain sensitivity in
the emulsion, which in turn is determined by the details of the way the
emulsion is made. Any change in effective contrast is probably accompianied
by a change in Dmax. 
  A water bath may allow some change in curve shape by allowing
preferential exhaustion of the developer, as the technique does with film,
but the effect is likely to be minimal. 
  As far as VC paper, the contrast is determined by the combined densities
of effectively two emulsions (although they are mixed together for
coating). Some VC curves seem to indicate the change in contrast is mainly
in the shadows and there is little change in highlight contrast. See the
data sheets for Ilford Multigrade IV for an example. Other paper seems to
have a contrast curve which changes all over as the curves for Agfa
Multicontrast Premium or Kodak Polymax indicate. This may be no more than
an artifact of the way these curves are made. 
  Curves for graded paper show there can be a change in both the slope and
shape of the curves. In general VC papers do not change curve shape with
slope. 
  So, there is some difference in the way the two respond to contrast
change but also the variation in curve which changes the rendition of
tones. Kodak, evidently, has tried to match the tonal quality of of the
various contrasts of its graded papers but there is still variation. My
memory is that there was a lot of variation in Brovira. This curve shape
may account for the difference in quallity of prints which are otherwise
similar in contrast. 
  Personally, I've found that, although I may think graded paper looks
better when I am making prints, that later, looking at mounted prints, its
hard to see any difference. This is even true comparing fiber to RC. Fiber
still has an advantage in permanence despite manufacturer's claims to the
contrary.
  Unfortunately, there are getting to be very few graded papers on the
market, and fewer grades of those still made. Azo, once available in six
contrast grades (at least in glossy surface) is now, I believe, available
in only two.

That seems like a lot of 'overexposure'... what happens to your shadows?

It is not really a lot of "overexposure" - brightly lit snow is easily north
of Zone VIII-IX, 3-4 stops above the Zone V that a normal meter will indicate.
Zones X and above are not unheard of - remember that a properly exposed and
processed piece of modern film can easily hold 12-14 stops of information,
*even though the paper cannot begin to render it all*.  The idea is to get as
much into the negative as possible and then use what you like when printing
later.

The intent of this approach is to shove the zones up even higher than
this during exposure and then, via a lot of underdevelopment, get the high
zones back down into the real world of what we can print.  In so doing, we
force the negative up on the HD curve's straighline portion where tonal separation
is best (i.e., most linear).  While this does move the shadows up, they can
always be printed down in the final print - it is a LOT harder to make a
final print from an underexposed negative, than it is to burn down the shadows
(or increase contrast via a higher grade of paper or increasing magenta time
under a VC light source) from a nice beefy negative.

The more I print the more I agree with Barnbaum's latest series of articles
in Creative Camera Techniques (or whatever its called these days) - most
negatives do not get enough exposure...

Snow is a good example of where PMK Pyro comes into its own.  Will hold the
highlights instead of having them block to white while shadows still have
good detail.

Me too, with purely anecdotal evidence.

I base my approach on a "model" of paper emulsion that consists of two 
elements, high and low contrast.  Each has its own exposure vs. density 
response (represented by two E-logD curves).

With a 00 filter (or -1 setting on an LPL VCCE head) you expose for the 
highlight areas (zone 7):  the shadows (what should be zone 1 or 2) are far 
too light (unless your neg is REALLY contrasty, in which case split 
printing won't work anyway).

The other exposure (before or after) at the 5 setting is small enough so it 
brings the darkest shadows to (or near) maximum density on the paper.  This 
high contrast exposure, with a "normal" negative, will have minimal effect 
on the highlights:  the same #5 exposure alone would produce near-maximum 
shadow density with clear white highlights.

However, since the world ran out of perfection some time ago, there will be 
some interaction between the two exposures in all zones.  I've tried 
several times to construct a series of graphs that would translate two 
different amounts of enlarger exposure (time and aperture) using different 
filters, through negatives of a specific density range, using the high and 
low contrast E-logD curves, into a curve for total E-logD for the 
print.  Haven't succeeded so far;  suggestions welcome.

Until I figure out how to make those calculations with some accuracy, I 
won't have even a theoretical basis for saying if split filter printing 
produces the same print as a single exposure.  And of course "with 
accuracy" means knowing the response curves of real emulsion components 
(anybody have a copy?) which is what will determine the result.

Rusty,

Well I can't make that statement as an absolute statement but I have made
good prints with VC papers. And for certain negatives I don't think in terms
of grades but rather filter packs (I print with a dichro head).

Well it seems that many people always cite the capabilities of graded papers
as they used to be, but this is now. I used to use Ilford Galerie, and
Ilfobrom, Kodabrome, Brovira and Portiga  papers with Selectol, Selectol
Soft, and Dektol. Given my printing ability and certain negatives I could
produce a decent prints but now I think I can interpret negatives with
greater ease with VC. Having said that though many of my Polaroid PN 55
negatives bring very well on my remaining stock of Ilfobrom #2. And yes I do
think that the graded papers toned very well. But so do OS VC , Forte VC,
and AGFA MCC.

RC papers are not in debate here but they are capable of making some decent

Well how do you know that? Other than perhaps they are vintage?

Absolutely, MB IV doesn't change color but it does gain in DMAX. This can be
measured.

I wish I could get split tones like Kenna or Izu perhaps that is one
advantage to graded papers.

Why use an EI of 25 (when 50 is normal) and then open up 3-4 stops? Why not
just leave the EI at 50 and open up 4-5 stops? In other words, what are you
accomplishing by the one stop EI change that couldn't have been accomplished
equally well by opening up an additional stop?

It is a matter of developing repeatable habits - either way works, of course.
I'm used to determining my "personal EI" in the traditional Zone System
method - "What ASA (EI) yields about 0.1 DU above FB+F?"  Invariably
this turns out to be about 1 full stop slower than what is marked on
the box.  I use this as a baseline from which I work.  In other words,
this is a matter of intellectual convenience - the film still works
the same way no matter how you view it in your head.  The point is to
get enough light on the emulsion to make a full range negative.

In "normal" lighting situations, this turns out to be pretty important
because if you expose the film at rated ASA you almost always end up
with lousy shadow detail.  Using the 0.1DU over FB+B baseline gives you
a much more reliable starting point for getting snappy negs, which, after
all, is the whole point.

FWIW, too much has been written about Zone System as if it were magic.  It is
nothing more than a notation system and way of seeing the material that
provides consistency and ease of use...

Don, While I don't see as much color shift with MG IV , it 
certainly does shift in color with both Kodak RST and Maco 
Selenium toner, both at 1:19 and 1:10. It goes reddish and 
purplish.

Rusty,  You might try the David Lewis paper that I wrote on 
for the PhotoVision Magazine.  It was a very nice paper.  I 
also found that the Seagull G2 and 3 are printing nicely 
now.  For customer work I find that VC paper allows a 
quicker adjustment to their negatives.  For my personal 
work, or negatives of consistent quality , graded papers are 
a first choice.

I only use Kodak RST and I have never got it to shift color at the dilutions
you specify. I use distilled water and don't mix the toner with a clearing
agent. With MG warm tone yes it does shift redish in color, in fact it will
split tone quite easily.

Geoff
I'm sure below the lens filters are feasible. Regardless of which type of
filter you use you need to wait 1min or so after touching the enlarger head
to allow any vibrations to die away before making a further exposure. As
with camera lens filters, I think you must keep the below the lens filters
very clean and unscratched.

Happy New Year

I've been curious about PMK Pyro for quite some time but not sure if I
should jump in.  Do you use Pyro for all of your negatives or only for very
contrasty situations?  Is it as difficult to use as I've heard?

I thought it was fairly well accepted that MG IV is a difficult paper to
tone or bleach. OTOH, Kodak Polymax  Fine Art is easy in both respects, so I
switched a couple years ago. However, when I used MG IV I  was always able
to get a color change  (though I considered that undesirable since I don't
care for the purplish look) with an RST dilution of 1-4 for about 4 minutes.

Fred Newman, owner of The View Camera Store (formerly Darkroom Innovations),
published an article in his newsletter a couple years ago showing the
results of his tests for optimum D max with Kodak RST on a variety of
papers. All gained D Max with RST in some dilution and time. Interestingly,
when the papers were toned for longer than the optimum time he found that D
Max started to reduce.  As I recall, in his tests Ilford MG IV toned best
(defining best for this purpose as optimum D Max) at 1-9 for 4 minutes. Of
course this presumably would be dependent in part on the water that he used,
the developer he used, etc. so you'd have to run your own tests.

Hi Tim - Thanks for the response. I  understand why you don't use the
manufacturer's rating. Like you, my tests usually show that cutting it in
half or thereabouts produces the desired Zone I density. My question was
directed more at why you both reduced your normal EI and opened up three or
four stops in the situation being discussed. It seemed to me that it would
be simpler to leave the EI the same and then open up an additional stop.
(i.e. 4 0r 5 stops instead of 3 or 4) rather than changing your EI from 50
to 25 and then opening up 3 or 4 stops.  I always hate to change the EI for
a particular film on my meter or camera once I've done the testing - half
the time I forget that I've made the change and then mess up the next batch
of negatives. So I wondered if there was some advantage to changing the EI
rather than adjusting the aperture. I gather it's more a matter of personal
preference.    Thanks again.

Don, I like the tri tones of those guys, too; but it has little to do with
split printing.

Kenna soes sepia toning and sometimes sellenium tones aftwrwards, the
technique for split toning has to do with the bleaching before redvelopment
in the sepia solution.

Pull the print out of the bleach before the black is gone from the print and
sepia tone to a split brown and black; then sellenium to taste.  I did that
with copper and sellenium, which was good for over exposed prints ... dark
prints that I recovered with the copper toner.

Ah, now I understand the original question better.  In general, when
you underdevelop, you *mostly*, but not completely change the highlights.
In actual fact, especially with a gross amount of underdevelopment, the
effective ASA of the film is actually reduced as well (shadows are affected).
Reducing the ASA when taking the meter reading merely anticipates this
factor.  As you point out, you can also do it in your head by
adding a stop of exposure in anticipation of this effect...

..I was also surprised about their firm statements about alkaline
fixers: what do you think of their claim that hypo clearing after an
alkaline fixer is not necessary?

And while we are on this subject: they also claim that using a
sodiumthiosulphate fixer is unwise for modern (tabular) films, since
they contain (more?) silveriodine, which Na.ThioSulphate won't fix

I was wondering about the following: I am using a JOBO 2509 reel in a
2523 drum for 4*5 inch film. This (older) reel can hold 1 to 4 sheets
(the newer upto 6). If I keep the volume constant (say 400 ml PMK Pyro),
and provide sufficient developer: is there a difference when processing
just 1 sheet or the max of 4 sheets (density wise), when processed under
the same conditions? Would there be a diffence when I would use less
devloper for one sheet (say 200ml?)

I guess theoriticly there shouldn't be a difference. Practically I can
think of different densities due to a different turbulance pattern.

(This is more an academic question, in practice I almost always process
4 sheets at the same time)

Wow !
First of all I'll like to thanks you all for the response you gave.
I'm impressed by the knowledge you share with others !
Next I'll add some piece of information I've found in.... Toulouse,
where I live.
The nearest chemical supplier shows me a chemical catalog from a company
called Acros chemical, specializing in photochemistry !
They have a web site which is http://www.acros.be with a search engine
accepting names, CAS number or chemical formulas ! They provide also the
MSDS !
They sell chemicals in small to medium amount but often in reagent
grade. 
If you're a professional I think you could buy online.
thanks to everibody, and do not drink too much Champagne !
Hope you will have a nice new year holliday !

Hello List,
I'm using PMK for quite some time, and something happened with the 4 last
batches I processed that I can't figure out. FP-4 film 4x5", presoak in
water at same temperature than PMK, processed in PMK, rinse at same
temperature with water, fixer, PMK for 2 minutes, wash. And I have
pin-holes. Not too many, maybe 3 or 4 per 4x5, more than enough to ruin the
photos. Where I'm lost is that I didn't change anything in my way of
processing the film: same method, dilution, agitation, tremperature, same
tank etc... and pin-holes that I never experienced before are there now. I
did try to change the fix from Ilford to Kodak to TF-4 from Photographers'
Formulary, but without success.
The only think I'm thinking of as a possibility would be a bad batch of
FP-4...
Anybody else?

Bob. Thanks for the advice re friction devices, trouble is I don't remember
seeing 'em when I was poking about in the colour head, perhaps I should
dismantle further! Which I don't fancy doing at all! Although it was
suggested a while ago why not use below the lens filters, is that feasible
do you think?

Ilford's quality control has always been less than perfect. Film or paper. 
For at least the past twenty years that I am aware of. Great products but 
occasional problems.

  I think this is a confounding of the effect of alum hardener on fixing
time. The hardener tends to bind thiosulfate to the silver crystals when
the pH is within a fairly narrow range. When the emulsion is treated with
an alkaline bath the bond is at least partially broken and washing time is
much faster. Chrome hardener does not have this effect and washing times of
chrome hardened emulsion is about the same as an unhardened one despite the
much lower pH required by chrome to work. The pH is not the issue but
rather an effect of aluminum sulfate. In fact, the pH required for alum to
work best is just outside of the range of pH at whcih its mordanting effect
is greatest.
  An alkaline fixing bath would wash out at about the same rate as an acid
fixing bath without aluminum sulfate hardener. Even with the hardener an
alkaline bath would neutralize the acid bringing it into a range where the
mordanting effect no longer takes place.
  Sulfite wash aid has another effect, although it also adjusts the pH.
Sulfite evidently acts as an ion exchage medium for thiosulfate and
possible thiosulfate-silver complexes. A properly compounded sulfite wash
aid is more effective even than sea water in accellerating washing. The
effect on pH is only a minor part of this, it is the ion exchange which is
the main feature. Kodak Hypo Clearing Agent is a mixture of sodium sulfite
buffered to about neutral pH with sodium bisulfite and with some EDTA tetra
sodium salt added for a couple of reasons. One is to bind calcium in the
water for better mixing but also to prevent a scumming effect which can
take place if there is much calcium in the water. 
  Because of the ion exchange effect a sulfite wash aid probably
accelerates washing even when a alkaline fixing bath is used. 
  It is well known that ammonium thiosulfate fixing baths are less effected
by dissolved iodide than sodium thiosulfate baths. Since most pictorial
film contains a lot of silver iodide the use of an ammonium thiosulfate
fixer will result in greater capacity of the fixing bath and more reliable
fixing of the film. The effect for paper is minimal since paper emulsions
generally do not contain iodide. However, rapid fixer can have some
advantage in saving time with paper when used at film concentration. Ilford
depends on very rapid fixing to avoid absorption of thiosulfate by the
fibers of fiber paper. The requirement is that the fixing be complete
within one minute. There are papers which will not fix in this time. Ilford
data indicates that absorption is rather rapid after one minute, nearly all
advantage is lost of fixing time is extended to two minutes or longer. 
  Where longer fixing times are required the use of wash aid and longer
washing times will result in equally thiosulfate free base. 
  The use of the Ilford method does not eliminate the need for toning to
protect the image. 
  The capacity of a single fixing bath is very limited, probably no more
than 10 8x10 prints per GALLON! Fixing is a process which goes through
several stages. At each stage the thiosulfte-silver complexes become more
soluble in water. When fixer starts becoming exhausted the process never
gets to the point where the complex is fully soluble, so the stuff never
washes out no matter how long the wash time is. For the Ilford method,
where a single bath is practically necessary, the fixing bath should really
be used as a one-shot, a new bath being made up for each print.
  For general use, where more time can be allowed for fixing time, a two
bath system should be used. The first bath does most of the work, the
second bath stays relatively fresh so it can complete the reactions of any
complexes to the completely soluble stage.
  Complete fixing is very important since complexes remaining in the
emulsion will rapidly deompose to compounds which can not be converted by
later fixing and which will eventually attack the image. 
 Note that it is possible to wash too much. The old wisdom was that NO
thiosulfate at all should be left in an emulsion if the images were to be
permanent. In fact a large amount of thiosulfate will attack the image,
sulfiding it and causing migration of the sulfide causing stains. This sort
of staining can not really be undone since the sulfide will have migrated
away from its original position. 
  However, around 1961 T.H.James of Kodak Research Labs discovered that a
small residue of thiosulfate actually _protected_ the image silver from
attack by peroxides. Kodak kept quiet about this since the amount of
thiosulfate needed was very small and they were much more afraid of under
washing, which would definitely destroy the image, than over washing. 
  When the same effect was discovered at Fuji and published, Kodak had to
publish their own research too. It was at that time that Kodak stopped
recommending the use of hypo eliminator (not wash aid) and began to
recommend much more conventional washing procedures for both film and paper
for permanence. Not that is a sulfite wash aid is used the washing times
become very short. These times should be followed since, in this case, more
is not better. 
  The thiosulfate residue is not as effective as the use of a toner. For
really permanent images both film and paper should be toned in a
polysulfide toner like Kodak Brown Toner, or the special toner recommended
by the Image Permanence Institute. Such toning yields a very high degree of
resistance to peroxides and further sulfiding.

This is the capacity of film strength fixer?

Chuck,
I thought about it, but over several batches? Also, they pretty much look 
alike. Grit or dust would give me a variety of shapes and sizes. Someone 
suggested poor Ilford quality control... I'll run a test with Kodak, if I 
still have some laying around.

Probably from something other than the PMK.  The chemistry is NOT THERE to
make pin holes.  Pin holes were common with carbonate based chemistry where
the stop or fix could generate carbon dioxide and blow little craters in the
emulsion.   I have used FP4 with PMK and either Ilford fix or Kodak rapid
fix w/o hardner without problems.  Mechanical damage is another possibility
since the emulsion is extremly delicate after processing in PMK.  Look at
the negatives with a loupe and what do you see in the damaged area?

 <SNIP>

First, there will be a difference in agitation with one or four sheets of
film in the reel.  Some of the density difference could be due to that since
PMK is really pickey about agitation.  I have found that the JOBO sheet film
reels do better with PMK if you run the tank close to liquid full.  Less
aerial oxidation.  That translates into 1.5 to 2 L of developer in the
double reel tank (12 sheets).  

According to Hutchens, PMK capacity is 16 4x5 sheets/L of working solution.
I usually do not go past a 50% of capacity limit.  The developer is dirt
cheap so why skimp.

PMK has a learning curve.  The best source of information is to start with
Gordon Hutchings'  THE BOOK OF PYRO.  I will use PMK on negatives where
there is a large range of values.  Good for contraction but I have not had
any luck with N+ development w/PMK.  Tim wanna chime in here with your
experience?  Also PMK can produce negatives that print well in silver and
also have enough contrast for alt. process printing due to the yellow stain.
It is not a magic cure all but it is another tool to have on the shelf.

Well, just that: holes. I checked the only think I didn't check, and that's 
the PMK solutions. The B has some kind of undiluted white micro-grains, and 
it may be the reason, if they land on the emulsion. Even with the 
agitation? I'll do a test tmw after filtering both A and B, and we'll see.

Here's where I get all confused and maybe I'm missing something obvious here
but wouldn't the yellow stain INCREASE contrast?  And how would that help
very contrasty negatives?  Or am I missing something really obvious here?

According to Ilford, the capacity of Ilford Universal fix is 3200 square
inches of fiber base paper using a wash aid, which works out to 40 sheets of
8x10. With some kinds of RC paper, it goes up to 6400 square inches or 80
sheets.  The capacity is limited to 800 square inches (i.e. 10 sheets of
8x10) only if a wash aid isn't used.

The thing that happens, with pyrogallol developers, is that as the pyro
develops the image, it oxidizes (giving the selective yellow stain) and it
hardens the gelatine at the same time.  Therefore, in the highlights, the
gelatin is hardned and it slows the development process - fresh chemistry
cannot diffuse into the emulsion as fast.   That is why pyro is called a
"tanning" developer.  If you look at a wet film developed in PMK, there is a
relief pattens that is visible on the surface. More swelling in the shadows
than there is in the highlights.  The slowing of development in the
highlights is important for PMK to give the retention of highlight detail
and give the compensating effects.

The yellow stain also serves as a  contrast reducing  mask for printing on
VC papers.  I have some negatives that print easily in one of the alt.
process methods that require a high contrast negative, and will print in
silver on a #2 graded paper and needs 2.5 to 3ish filtration for a VC paper.
The yellow stain does increase contrast, for a process that needs UV light,
since it is opaque at those wavelengths.  Graded enlarging, and VC papers
have sensitivity that extends into the wavelengths of light that are
transmitted through the stain.  Azo, on the other hand, being a blue
sensitive contact paper is more sensitive to the pyro stain.

Does this help?  Or have I further confused matters?

I've had no trouble bleaching MGIV although it doesn't bleach as quickly as

OK, I have to ask...

How come a washing agent has an effect on the print fixing capacity...
especially since any wash-aid is not used until after any print print
is/should be properly fixed, before it goes into the wash-aid.

If you come up a bit short on the snow stuff, have plenty I can send.
Willing to throw in some sleet just for grins.  As they said, when we moved
to NE Oklaoma,  "what snow we get is usually gone by noon and is never on
the ground for more than three days." HA!  Had this stuff for 3 weeks+  and
it is going to hang around till?  Neat images this AM - - heavy frost on
everything!

Cheers gang.

It is probably close to that, or less, for archival processing.
The problem is removing insoluble monoargentothiosulfate from the
emulsion, which requires a great excess of non-complexed thiosulfate.
The archival one-bath capacity of paper fixer is 5 prints per
gallon, so doubling concentrations _might_ raise the value to ten.

There's no reason to believe that rapid fixers have a greater capacity.
The capacity recommendations from EKC have indicated
the same capacities for rapid and hardening fixers. The alkaline "plain"
fixers' capacities are less than that 
of the common commercial fixers. 

Below, I've pasted in table on one and two bath fixer capacities 
from one of my occasional posts to rec.photo.darkroom.


Note on capacities and two bath fixing:

Grant Haist, the former director of research at Kodak, cites the
following maximal permissible values for one-bath film and paper fixers
for commercial and archival processing:  

One-bath fixation:     Commercial         Archival

Film:

Max. Ag conc.:         1.5 g/l            0.2 g/l
Max rolls/gal:         25 rolls/gal       2 rolls/gal
Non-image Ag in film:  0.01 mg/in^2       0

Paper:

Max. Ag conc.:         0.3 g/l            0.05 g/l
Max. sheets/gal:       30 8x10            5 8x10
Non-image Ag in paper: 0.005 mg/in^2      0

Essentially, as fixer total silver (free and complexed) and halide 
concentrations rise, the fixer's ability to remove all of the silver from
the paper diminishes markedly, as indicated by the very limited capacity
of one-bath to remove silver to archival levels.

The solution to the limited capacity is to use a fresh second fixer bath
to maintain a very low total silver level, with a water rinse between the
first and second baths to minimize fixer/silver carry-over. Some older
texts even suggest a fresh third bath.


Two bath fixation:      Commercial      Archival

Film:

Bath 1:
Max. Ag conc.:          6 g/l           3.5 g/l
Max. rolls/gal:         60-70           40

Bath 2:
Max. Ag conc.:          0 .5-1.5 g/l    0.02 g/l
                        after 60-70     after 40
                        
Non-image Ag in film:   0.01 mg/in^2     0


Paper:

Bath 1:Max. Ag conc.:    2 g/l            0.8 g/l
Max. sheets/gal:         200 8x10         70 8x10

Bath 2:
Max. Ag conc.:           0.3 g/l          0.05 g/l
                         after 200        after 70
                         
Non-image Ag in paper:   0.005 mg/in^2    0

The first fixer gets rid of most of the silver, and the second maintains
a very low silver concentration and relatively high free thiosulfate
concentration to remove the remainder of the insoluble complexes and
non-image silver present in the emulsion after the first fixation.

The first bath is used for the maximum number of sheets or rolls
indicated, and then discarded after silver recovery. 

The second bath is substituted for the first, and a fresh second bath is
prepared. 

After 5 cycles (substitutions), or one week if continuously exposed to
air in tanks, both baths are replaced. Compare the capacity for
commercial or archival standards using two baths to that for one. Two
bath fixation is far more economical than using one bath, and avoids the
temptation to over-use fixer which results in under-fixation and
difficult removal of insoluble complexes which destroy prints and film.

I've never shot any snow scenes, but I've done a lot of surfing shots, and the
whitewater is just as bright as snow.  I had to do a lot of burning-in of the
highlights until I switched to Pyro.  The difference was very apparent from the
first roll.  The highlights just hold detail beautifully.

 I think I may have been mistaken and the capacity is 10 sheets of 8x10 per
LITER. Ilford blows hot and cold about this claiming the capacity is
greater when their archival sequence is used and is greater for RC paper.
I've seen no published data. The data booklet claims these numbers were
determined by accelerated aging tests. 
  Ilford also claims that fixer capacity is increased by using a wash aid.
It _may_ be that wash aid makes some silver-thiosulfate complexes soluble
which are not otherwise, but again, there is no citation of any data. If
you can fix longer than Ilford's recommended 30 seconds ot one minute a two
bath fixer is preferable since it pretty much assures that the fixing
reactions are completed. 
  There is also a curious paper called _Mysteries of the Vortex_ by Martin
Reed, "Photo Techniques" July-August 1996. This is a discussion of washing
processes and of archival washers. The author seems to have swallowed all
of Ilford's claims whole. He quotes Ilford on the effect of thiosulfate
residue as saying that it has a preserving effect only on prints which are
displayed but that for dark stored prints the most complete thiosulfate
removal possible is desirable. I think IPI's experience with dark stored
microfilm blows this out of the water. While displayed prints certainly get
more exposure to atmospheric polutants, particularly peroxides, they are
present in dark storage conditions also. Ultra-violet light accelerates the
effects of oxidants on the image but oxidation can take place in the
absense of light. Much microfilm, even treated with Selenium toner, has
been found to have redox spots and other signs of oxidation. Residual
thiosulfate is not a cure for this, it doesn't produce enough sulfiding, or
produce it in a sufficently controlled fashion, but toning with polysulfide
does both. 
  I don't clain Ilford is wrong only that their conclusions are somewhat
different from other researchers in image permanence.
  I have been intending for quite some time to write a summary of
processing for permanence according to IPI recommendations with the aid of
Dr. Nishmura, but the facts of life, and a friend's cancer surgery have put
a kink in it. There is a perfectly enormous amount of conflicting
information about this subject making it hard to know what to believe. I
find the work of Kodak and the IPI most trustful because all their data and
means of gathering it are available.

  I didn't see Mike's answer before posting my own. Mike has posted a lot
of stuff on the chemistry of fixing to the rec.photo.darkroom group
recently enough for it to be in the Deja.com archive. I strongly recommend
searching it out and reading it. Search for Gudzinowicz, that seems to work. 
  I also suggest doing an author search for Nishimura for the material
posted by Dr. Nishamura of the IPI. Between these two you will get a pretty
good idea of what is involved with making images last. Gudzonowicz is one
of those few folk who can explain really difficult subjects in a way which
makes them understandible without misleading over simplifications. 
(YOu may blush now sir).

I'm a 35mm Tmax X loyalist and would like to investigate the use of PMK that 
I've heard so much about, not necessarly in connection with Tmax film.  Maybe 
Tmax is not the right film for PMK?

I also like to use the Jobo for developing 3, 4, or 5 rolls at a time. 

I realize it would be better for me to get a grasp of PMK with small tank 
developing and then adjust time and temp to the Jobo.  This is a lot of trial 
and error to go thru.  Here in NY we're expecting a heavy snow fall by 
Saturday night and a lot of film will be shot by Monday.  I process B/W Tmax 
for a couple of people and they have warned me that they will have a number 
of rolls by Monday.

Could somebody(s) suggest a starting point, dilution and any helpful 
suggestions of where to begin with the Jobo and PMK?

Bruce, try PMK at a 1:2:100 dilution (10 mL A, 20 mL B, 1L water) for 12 min
at 70F as a starting point.  The negatives will look thin and a brownish
yellow.  Print one first before giving up.  Run the tanks at least 1/2 full
of liquid to avoid aerial oxidation fog.  Probably not as bad with Tmax as
with Tri-X.

Processing sequence:
a.  water soak for 2-3 minutes. drain
b.  PMK freshly mixed for 12 minutes. (save the spent developer)
c.   stop with water
d.   fix 3-4 min in NON-HARDENING fixer
e.   water wash 1 or 2 changes of water
f.   re-stain the film by treating with the spent PMK for 2 minutes
g.  wash and dry as usual

It should be noted that PMK is not a fine grain developer.  Grain can be
pronounced on films such as Tri-X.  TMX will not be as bad.  The stain also
helps to mask the grain.

Good Luck

     Howard F. Efner

Bainbridge Artcare boards have an active microchamber trapping system which
has been tested and is supposed to protect artwork against airborne
pollutants and outgassing from the works themselves. Both Bainbridge and
independent testing both show this works much better than using 100% rag
board without this technology in preserving the image.

If this product does work well, why not interleave some of it or package our
images for storage with the Bainbridge Alpharag Artcare board? Since it
comes in one ply 100% rag it can be used as a barrier paper or interleaved
with prints in storage or used in shipping.

It seems it would be a simple solution to extra protection for valuable
images.

Anyone know of any reasons it wouldn't be a good solution to some of the
storage problems we have with prints? Possibly even a protecting method when
one uses/mats/mounts RC papers, as a way to try & protect them from the
sulfiding & bronzing that occurs from time to time?

Plan on a Utah photo trip in August 2002. Brigham City Museum Gallery will
host a photographic show, The Great American West: The B&W Landscape.
It features the images of Dick Arentz, Paula Chamlee Tillman Crane, Chip
Hooper, Craig Law, Ray McSavaney, Barry Parsons, John Sexton, Dan Smith and
Michael A. Smith.
This a show you don't want to miss and a perfect time to visit Utah on your
vacation. Brigham City is in Northern Utah, about an hour North of Salt Lake
City, home of the Bear River
Migratory Bird Refuge and on the way to Yellowstone National Park.
If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me for information as
I am the curator of the show.

Hello every body,

    I have a question about Ilford paper developers : does some one knows
the difference between PK universal and Multigrade paper developers. In the
past I used PK universal and then moved to Multigrade. Recently I tried
again PK and founded that the blacks are less deep and the time for the
blacks to appear in the developer is longer as is the time to get full
development. This was with Bergger VC CB (Wt) paper but in a less extend
with Ilford VC WT. Do other people have observed similar results?
Many thanks

I asked Ilford the same thing and they gave me an answer that made sense at
the time but which I confess I've now forgotten. You might want to ask them.
My information came by e mail from ILFORDTS@aol.com dated June 11, 1998.
Their exact response to my question concerning capacities was is as follows:

1520 square inches for film
6400 square inches for commercial grade RC paper
3200 square inches for archival grade RC paper
800 square inches for fiber base without the use of a wash aid
3200 square inches for fiber base with the use of a wash aid.

These capacities were per liter.

Isn't it common for some of the metaborate to precipitate out in the B stock?  It should go right back into solution when you make working strength developer....

Hello,

	I never tested it, PhotoFormulary seels a alkaline fixer
	named TF-4, probabily based on this one. Maybe someone can
	tell us more about using TF-3 and DiXactol or PMK.

The formula for TF-3 from Anchell & Troop book
The Film Developing Cookbook is:

Ammonium Thiosulfate            800ml.
Sodium Sulfite Anh. (pH 8.0)      50g.
Sodium Metaborate (pH 10.5)     20g.
Water to make 1 liter.

Working solution: dilute 1:4 with water.

	Regards,

		Saverio.

Hello Everybody

Please let me know if I am abusing this group with this announcement. It is
directed at all those members who reside in the UK, particularly in the
South Yorkshire area.  The Yorkshire Monochrome Group is holding an
exhibition of members work on the theme "Shape and Shade" at the Wath upon
Dearne Community Library from 5th January to 27th January. Anybody who is
able to visit the exhibition will see the results of using many of the
techniques which have been discussed on this forum. I know that in my short
time as a subscriber to Pure Silver I have picked up a lot of useful
information and I hope that this will manifest itself in some of my
exhibits.
I will be very happy to provide any further information on or off the list.

May I wish you all a very happy and prosperous New Year

Bob

New Year's Greetings!

Please excuse the cross-list posting.

I would like to bring to your attention an article I've written in the
current issue (Dec/Jan) of CAMERA ARTS magazine.

The article is the first of two about split-toning.  While this first half
is non-technical in nature, it provides a solid base of background
information for the formulas and process notes which follow in the Feb/March
issue.

In the current issue I discuss the background and historical antecedents of
modern split-toning - which I take all the way back to the daguerreotype.  I
make a distinction in this article between split-effects - the often exotic
coloration seen in many antique images - and the relatively recent
deliberate attempts to achieve those tonal shifts through the use of toners.
I suggest in the article that an appreciation for split-toning springs from
a 19th century sensibility....

While I regret space considerations prevented the inclusion of all the
historical images I sent to illustrate my points, the reproductions include
one of Jerry Spagnoli's beautiful daguerreotypes of New York City (1998) and
a striking bromide print of an oyster and pearl (1900) from the collection
of Richard and Christine Rydell, among others.  (Happily, one of my recent
split-toned images is also included).

I hope you seek it out and enjoy it....

Best wishes-

Jonathan Bailey

Hi Don - I guess this is just one of those areas where different people have
different experiences, perhaps because of different local conditions.  I had
trouble bleaching with it but thought it was just me. Then I read somewhere
(maybe Bruce Barnbaum's book?) that it didn't bleach as well as some other
papers (by "well" I mean easily) so I decided it wasn't just me and changed
to Polymax Fine Art, which bleaches easily and tones nicely also (at least
for me).

Hi,

I worked for 6 years as the photo technician for the Provincial Archives
here, and recieved extensive training and education on archival storage
methods. The Microchamber boards are RECOMENDED for storage of photographs,
as they trap the pollutants. The latest issue of View Camera Magazine had an
interview with Hollinger, who helped develop the board. An article which
will make you want to throw out all your Rag Board, and other "acid-free"
mats, and buy all new boards - all micro-chambered.

RC will still die, but the fibre, and colour, will love you for caring so
much!

I am confused here. What difference does it make in fixing the prints when a
wash aid is used AFTER the fixing bath?

Isn't rinsing the fixer out just that: rinsing it out? How can use or non
use of a wash aid after fixing affect the fixer capacity?

  Perhaps Mike Gudzinowicz could comment on this. The idea is that the
chain of reactions of fixing results in increasingly soluble compounds.
Until the reactions are complete the reaction products are not completely
soluble. Perhaps wash aid makes some of these earlier compounds soluble, if
so I've seen no mention of it anywhere.
  The capacity of fixer for different types of emulsions depends on how
soluble that emulsion is in the fixing bath. Ilford's differences between
RC and fiber don't make a lot of sense, unless Ilford RC has much thinner
emulsion with less silver halide in it. Unless there is somthing I don't
know (and there easily could) the difference between RC and fiber capacity
makes no sense.

Yes they do. See their website:

http://www.superiorarchivalmats.com/

Now I wonder if anyone in the UK stocks their products at a
reasonable price.

It's interesting to see how in the example on their web site and
View Camera magazine, mounting tisssue acts as a barrier and
limits degradation, and how poorly hinge mounting performs
which has free access for pollutants to the back of the print.

Conservation Resources make microchamber boards and boxes in the UK, and
many other useful archival products. A good company and very helpful. I have
no connection with them but have dealt with them for years.
Phone UK 01865 747755 or e mail 100436.3447@compuserve.com
They have an excellent catalogue but no web site

We've got a foot already here in Westchester. I'm on my way out the door
now.

Thanks for the good luck wishes.

I cannot at the moment put the exhibition images on the web because they are
all mounted in glazed frames so they cannot be scanned until after the
exhibition. However, the Yorkshire Monochrome Group has a website which
includes a gallery at : www.holmfieldautos.f9.co.uk/ymg.

As regards more information about the exhibition :  It is open during normal
library opening hours (details of which I cannot get until Tuesday but, the
library's telephone no is 01709 873542 ) from 5th January to 27th January.
Wath upon Dearne is a small town near Rotherham in South Yorkshire. There
are 60 prints on display including pictorial, landscape and figure studies
all of which explore the theme of Shape and Shade. As well as 'conventional'
printing, a variety of different techniques have been used including lith,
bromoil, cyanotype and (if I'm allowed to mention it) digital.

After Wath upon Dearne, the exhibition will be shown in York at the Barbican
Centre from 19th Feb to 31st March. I'll post access details for this
shortly. The YMG is also working on another project "Yorkshire 2000" which
will depict Yorkshire and its people during the centenary period. I will
post details of this exhibition when they are finalised.

Thank you for allowing me to tell you about these events. I hope some of you
will be able to visit one these venues and let me know what you think .

Bob

damn... I didn't know every camera store in NYC shut down for Shabbat.  Here
in Westchester I can drive to half a dozen or so places that sell sheet film
all day Saturday.  Now if only I could get out of my driveway....

Ok, here's a good one. Where can I buy 4x5 film preferably Ilford HP5 in 
Manhattan or Brooklyn today--Saturday. All my usual places are closed on 
Saturday and I forgot to stock up. It's 10:30am it's snowed at least 6 
inches in NYC.

Thanks

David, I assume you're using the Zone system (you should be, your film is).  I
hope meter meter meter doesn't mean an averaging meter, which as far as I
understand has no relationship to the process of exposing B&W film.  The black
stick problem must be from moving the trees below Zone 3 to try to put some
life in the snow, which at any exposure for trees should still be developed
for about Zone 7.   I'm seeing the question as how to get rid of the blob,
when even moving the blob and messing up the shadows and highlights hasn't
done it for you.  The little shadows of the granular snow surface are blue on
a sunlit day, and the film is quite sensitive to blue, so the shadows look a
lot like the snow to the film.  Thus the narrow tonal range blob.  Just like
shooting clouds in a blue sky, use a yellow filter to get a more normal (human
eye) relationship so the shadows give the snow the texture you're looking for.

I'm weighing in a bit late here on this one.  We've had a couple of weeks of
snow and ice here, didn't help the spare time situation any.  We're not really
snow belt, just snowed in anyway.

A couple of years ago I did extensive paper/ developer testing to pick a 
combo that would give me the richest blacks in a print.  These were not done 
with a densitometer, just my visual subjective opinion of a  "good black".  
I tested warm and cold tone papers, and of course the perception of a rich 
black usually comes from a cold paper.  The result was Oriental (or Forte 
MG) in Formulary BW-65 paper developer and Selinium toned 1-20 for five 
minutes.
>
I would like to find a warm tone paper/developer that would give me a rich 
black.  I know that Azo / Amidol is a favorite, but I really do not like 
printing on single weight paper.  Also I split filter print so a MG paper 
would be nice.  Any suggestions on what to test ?

Thanks in advance

Actually posts like that make me wish I paid more attention in my high school math and science classes.

Now when my kid complains about having to learn logs I can tell him that yes, he'll need to know it in real life someday.

Try a one year old who just discovered how to run after his dad.  That's why the gods of photography created high-speed film and AE/AF SLRs.

	Now that's an understatement ! I tried Crawley's FX-1 and even
diluted out the grain was simply huge. From what I've seen I think that
carbonates can be worse than hydroxides for a given alkalinity.

	Thanks for the very informative post !

  Generally, developers containing carbonates have more tendency to
graininess than lower pH developers since they tend to cause some
emulsion swelling.
