Your not wrong Barry, i too still use my pentax sv and also a spotmatic, i
have a 50mm 1.4, 35mm f2 and smc 100mm macro takumar and the results are
superb. I always envy you guys in the UK when i read at the classifieds in
the back of the uk mags with what seems a huge supply of secondhand pentax
equipment. It is quite cheap here in NZ, compared to the US secondhand
price, when you can get it. I think there are a lot of people out there who
still enjoy their old pentax gear.

This gets complicated:  the Konica Autoreflex T of 1968 was the first
FOCAL-PLANE 35mm camera with auto TTL.  The Voigtlander and Zeiss Ikon
cameras both had Compur shutters.

Barry,

A brief reply, and my first since Trish's accident in April... the next
issue of C&D (publication delayed until the end of July because I'm, of
necessity, a 24-hour carer and home-maker) includes a feature on "Unsharp
Masking" written by Ralph Lambrecht. He went on some of Howard Bond's
workshops and got the technique from him... and... refined it. With all due
respect to Howard's teachings, and artistry, he apparently didn't explain
how it worked (just that it did)... but Ralph's article reveals all. Those
who have had sight of the text say it is the best photo magazine explanation
yet.

Cheers,

Ed Buziak / Publisher

Hi Lee - No, the magazine isn't out of business, it just changed names =
(now called "Photo Techniques"). I don't know of a place where the =
article can be found on line. You could try ordering it as a back issue =
(Sept./Oct. 1994). Their web site is www.phototechmag.com

  Brian,
          Is there a place on line where this article can be read?  I =
don't have the Magazine and would like to read it.  Isn't that mag out =
of business?  Any help would be appreciated.



  At 07:12 AM 06/30/2000 -0400, you wrote:

    "His object lesson with that claim was misquoted?" Steve, have you =
ever read
    the article? The whole point of it  was to set forth the results of =
some
    testing that he did concerning the question of whether split =
printing
    produced results that couldn't be achieved with a single exposure. =
He
    concluded, based on the test results set forth in the article, that =
there
    was no advantage to split printing (keeping in mind that the term =
"split
    printing" in this context refers to making  multiple overall =
exposures, not
    to burning in portions of a print at  different contrasts, which I =
think
    everyone agrees is a very desirable feature of VC paper).

    Anyone can read the article themselves and decide that for some =
reason Phil
    is wrong and there really is some advantage to making two overall =
exposures
    at different contrasts,  though to me the results were very =
persuasive and,
    more importantly, made  lot of common sense. However, whether you =
think that
    Phil was right or wrong, I certainly didn't misquote any claims that =
he
    made.  If it will help you any, here's the conclusion as stated at =
the end
    of the article:  "As a result of this experience [referring to the =
tests and
    photographs he made that are described in detail in the article] I =
am
    personally persuaded that adjustment of print contrast affecting the =
entire
    image can be made as effectively (and at least as easily) with a =
single
    filter exposure as with any split filter technique - and with no =
discernible
    difference in image density range or gradation."

    When you said that he later "ate his hat" about the conclusions =
reached in
    the article, I understood that this was said in a proverbial sense.  =
I
    didn't think you were saying that he literally took a hat off of his =
head
    and digested it. However, since I doubt very much that Phil ever =
disavowed
    anything in the article, but since I also don't have a pipeline to
    everything Phil does or says, I just asked that you give us the =
source or
    basis for your statement. Since the purpose of the statement was to
    discredit my original message, it doesn't seem unreasonable to ask =
that you
    do this.

    For the benefit of others who might want to read the article and =
form their
    own conclusions, it appeared in the September/October issue of the =
magazine
    "Photo Techniques" which back then was called "Darkroom and Creative =
Camera
    Techniques."

For another perspective on how unsharp masking works you might want to
check out the writings of David Malin.  He is an astrophotographer
working at the Anglo-Australian Observatory who has done a lot of work
with unsharp masking.  His books include "The Invisible Universe", and
"A View of the Universe".  I belive that one of them includes
technical details on unsharp masking.  He has also published
informatino on unsharp masking in various astronomy journals.

Couple of more things.....
Just about all masks made by contact will work for unsharp masking. The
enlargement factor will determine the amount of " Unsharpness" that you want
or need.
You might use a highlight mask or shadow mask or the standard unsharp mask
that will not favor either end of the tonal range. All produce the "unsharp"
effect. { sometimes you might want to do more than just a standard mask - it
really works great for some images.

This is not a new trick. I started 25 years ago and it was "old hat"  then.
Graphic arts houses having to deal with artist { well known artist that
needed work reproduced when the public was aware of the original }  would
need to print the finest reproductions and many were superb at masking for
the offset press. I received my training doing aerial photography for survey
or surveillance and we had to open all of the shadows in case there was any
thing "hiding" there. :o).  We often made 40x60 negs and mask them at that
size so that retouching would be easier. { see what you get to do when the
government pays! } Anyway the folks who taught me had been doing it since
W.W.II. The recent interest in masking B&W is good to see but again this is
not anything new .....just getting some air after probably 60 or 70 years of
practice.  It's nice to see the fine art folks trying it out.

 I found this URL that I had saved as the absolute easiest article I've ever
seen on the subject.
The pictures are fairly accurate and much can be learned from this approach.

D. McNutt deserves a round of applause for this one.!!!!!!!

Anyone interested in masking would do well to look this over.
I read it in '89 when it was written and thought that
most of my questions about applying this technique were covered.
Just as flashing will do things that burning in won't accomplish this
will allow for quite a range of printing that wouldn't be available any
other way.
 The recent practice of leaving out the diffusion sheet is the way I have
chosen to go. I use a piece of white Plexiglas as the top sheet and the
diffusion caused by this sheet usually works well. Actually the thickness of
the plex will have some small effects.This way there is fewer dust
collecting surfaces and often the overmasking look is avoided. 600 grit wet
and dry automobile sandpaper can be used to "buff" the top and bottom of the
Plexiglas sheet when it gets scratched - just be sure to buff evenly all
over the surface. { not sure what Plexiglas is called on the other side of
the pond but I'm talking about plastic sheeting about 1/8th to 1/4 inch
thick and evenly toned white. }
Good luck,
Chuck
I'm off to get some new shots to try to mask  :o)

Sorry if the URL wrapped around and lost the ability to just click on it to
go. Guess that  you might have to copy and paste the whole thing.

Ill try again but someone that knows how to do this sort of thing might need
to help as I'm a bit of computer newbie.

All of the bandwidth on VC and split filtration has been interesting. 

 As I see it, there is no right or wrong method with VC paper.  It is the
final product that is important!  Yes, I have some negs that print like a
dream at one contrast setting (or filter).  There are some others that
demand something in between that just do not work at one or another contrast
filter or head setting.  These (if they know what is good for them) usually
are beaten into submission with split filtration printing.  I usually use
the "hard" light (high contrast filter) first followed by the "soft" (low
contrast) light.  I do this for two reasons: 1. it works, 2.  if the soft
light is used first, there is supposed to be a tendency to break the
threshold of both the low contrast and high contrast portions of the paper.
The high contrast light is supposed to only affect the high contrast
component of the emulsion.

Another use of split filter techniques is for negatives that need one area
printed in high contrast while other portions need a softer contrast - ie
the foreground needs higher contrast to bring out some shadow detail while
the background and sky needs additional exposure at a softer contrast to
burn-in the details.

Thanks for your reference. I tried it though and it "couldn't be found"
Any ideas?

As a dye transfer and carbon pigment print maker I had to learn the =
technique of designing masks to correct a wide variety wide of =
deficiencies. The chap who taught me also wrote a book on the subject =
called masking for the photographic processes. His name is Bob Pace and =
lives now in Apple Valley CA. It would be an invaluable reference book =
if you really want to get into masking.=20

    I am still using my stocks of Kodak Pan Masking film which I might =
add is still available in spite of belief to the contrary. However only =
in the 8x10 size for a staggering price of $500 USD for 50 sheets.=20
The best alternative I have found is a modified version of Ctein's =
technique using T-Max 100 and a very low reduction developer. I will use =
this method when I run out of masking film. If you read Bob's book you =
will see that contrast masking, highlight masking and the like are only =
the tip of the iceberg.

I tried it and it worked fine.
But first I copied/pasted the complete address including the part not
underlined into a Word doc. I then reduced the type size to get it all on
one line, placed the cursor after the final letter and then pressed the
spacebar to get the whole address underlined in blue - then clicked on it to
activate the browser. It went there first time - and like you Tim, I'm UK
based - so it shouldn't be a problem.
This may not be the most efficient IT expert solution but it does work.

Thanks Olaf,
I hadn't noticed that not all the address was underlined.
I just copied the last bit and pasted it onto the end of the rest on the
title bar and it worked fine. Thanks. An excellent article.
Chuck is quite right though. It is not a new idea and I know people who used
it for Cibachrome (as it was then) printing when it came out. I didn't know
it went back to WW11 though!
Tim

First of all I did not attempt to address what Davis said or wrote.  I ONLY
meant to support what I myself tried and found it worked.  Point of fact, I
thought interesting, was that I suggested it to another photographer before
I myself tried it; and when they who tried it and found it worked for them,
I too continue.

Davis' writing on the subject, subsequent to 1967 is making a case after the
fact of trial and error in favor of the process.

I repeat to give you credit:  My post referes to personal experience with
results of success.

I want to add that I give very much, credit to lots of what Davis has
written and have footnoted basis of his for archived scholarly essays.

Personally, my only sour note is that you all too often post queries without
personal experience.

Now, above you write Davis' results were based on a normal negative to begin
with, and no noticeable difference nehanced to was an asset to this print.

To me, this is a self defeating experiment; much like Bruce Barnbaums
examples that end with:  'Now, doesn't that look better?' All too often, I
look and say to me, myself alone.  "No."

I read above you agree with what I wrote; so with any further recant, feel
free to edit this thread as I didn't want to mis quote your editorial;
however this is gettinglong.

    I agree with Steve for an "easy negative" there is no differences in 
printing with only one filter or with  split printing but for a print more
difficult I found that split printing was much more convenient and I usually
use grade 5 first and then the softest one.
This is based on experience.

I was wondering what the short & long ends of the spectrum are in terms of 
darkroom exposure times.  While I've only seen reciprocity failure mentioned 
in terms of in-camera exposure, it makes perfect sense that it would also 
apply under the enlarger!

Printing with variable contrast, multigrade, or polycontrast papes has
nothing to do with photons striking the paper, or reciprocity calculations.

VC papers have two seperate chemistries.  One is green sensitive the other
is blue sensitive.

One is put down first onto the paper, the second on the top.

The green sensitive is the silver chloride, or light range (soft) emulsion;
while the blue sensitive is silver bromide or cold range (hard black)
emulsion.

While either can print dark black and white, white whites, combined they
make it possible to have a choice by using filters, calculated to effedct
the green AND blue through a mixture of light as in yellow or magenta.

It was always thought that thegreen sensitive emulsion would print
completely when exposed first, while the blue sensitive emulsion would over
power the softer silver chloride chemistry.

It was my suppostion that if the blue sensitive emulsion was exposed first,
then the green sensitive emulsion would 'come through' the darker emulsion
and cause shadow detail to seperate.

Through practice, it happened to have workes.  It works.

The thought came to me when hearing complaints from those who printed out of
sequence by mistake, 'that their dark blacks took on a muted black tone.'

"If there are multiple black tones," I thought and said, "the darkest would
stay that way if printed with enough light the first time, and the muted
black areas would allow the different sensitometry to come through as 'muted
tones.'"   It worked.

And, you can burn-in those areas with VC paper once you discover the
threshold values, too.  That's yet another subject:  Threshold Values and
How To Find Them.

Sorry Steve - VC paper does not have two layers, but one 'mixed' emulsion.
The results of printing split grade with hard exposure first, split grade
with soft exposure first, or one single exposure through the correct single
filtration (if necessary, at fractional grades) are identical. That applies
in theory and practice. All the mumbo jumbo of the mystique of split grading
is just that - mumbo jumbo.
There are very occasional times when split grading can be useful in giving
finer individual control of dodging during the exposure of each filter with
a difficult negative, but otherwise, it is just a long winded way of getting
the same result as a single filtered basic exposure through a VC  head with
stepless filtration. Burning in at differing contrast filtration is normal
with non-split grading. The real answer is to get the right negative in the
first place.
Incidentally, the routine that seems common among split-graders of burning
in skies with a soft filter leads to the plethora of muddy flat grey clouds
I see in exhibited pictures when they should gleam and be well separated.
Sure, soft filter burning in makes life easy. It's just that the results are
so flat, especially with printing from a film with a rolled off shoulder.

black areas would allow the different sensitometry to come through as 'muted
tones.'"   It worked.

And, you can burn-in those areas with VC paper once you discover the
threshold values, too.  That's yet another subject:  Threshold Values and
How To Find Them.

Well....  Some of the mumbo jumbo is mumbo jumbo.  There can be

Actually I find it faster.  With split printing I can place the
highlights and the shadows and let the mid tones fall where they might. 
With a single filtered exposure you get one point right (say middle
tones) and let the highlights and shadows fall where they might.
(clearly to select the appropriate filtration and exposure so that the
fall in the right places :-)

I find that with split printing I can get a good print out faster (I use
a chromega).  If I am doing multiple prints, then it does slow things
down.

In short, I suppose that I can get the degree of contrast I want more
quickly, and determine exactly where things will hit Dmin and Dmax on
the paper.

Yeah, print everything with grade 00 and you can probably use the same
exposure on every neg <grin>

Check the data sheets for paper you are using.
e.g.Agfa premium multicontrast RC
http://www.agfaphoto.com/library/datasheet/pdf/paper/p53p_e.pdf
see page 5
I'm not sure how to interpret the notation, but a chart shows
the paper speed as a function of exposure time.  (Between 0.1sec
and 100 sec, the speed drops by maybe delta lg H 0.1). The accompanying
text says that is nearly constant.  Over the same range the contrast
increases slightly then decreases. 
 

I believe that color paper is far more difficult in this regard, with
exposure time affecting color balance.

We've done some tests on the more popular (in the UK) VC papers such as
Ilford and Agfa, and found that as a first approximation most of them lose
speed at a rate of 0.1stop per stop of additional exposure.  We've built
this factor into our enlarging exposure meters and it does seem to hold
pretty well.

If you had one layer over the top of the other wouldn't this have the effect
of the top layer then masking the bottom layer?

Yes.  And, that's the effect.  Blue, effected fromthe top, alsoeffects the
green sensitive layer; but green less effects the Blue sensitive layer and
continues to serve the soft effect on the cold, blue sensitive chemistry, as
a self masking paper.

You saw that well.

Sorry Steve, I still don't understand what you are talking about. However,
whatever it is you are saying, it doesn't alter the fact that VC papers do
not have separate hard and soft layers of emulsion.

Steve Hodges replied:
Actually I find it faster.  With split printing I can place the
highlights and the shadows and let the mid tones fall where they might.
With a single filtered exposure you get one point right (say middle
tones) and let the highlights and shadows fall where they might.
(clearly to select the appropriate filtration and exposure so that the
fall in the right places :-)

I find that with split printing I can get a good print out faster (I use
a chromega).  If I am doing multiple prints, then it does slow things
down.

In short, I suppose that I can get the degree of contrast I want more
quickly, and determine exactly where things will hit Dmin and Dmax on
the paper.

My reply:
We are in pretty fair agreement Steve on most of the VC issues, and I have
no wish to 'rubbish' people who work with split-grade - only the weird and
wonderful claims made by the self deluded among them who assert magical
properties for the process closely akin to those made by mediaeval
alchemists.
For the record, I find single filtering generally quicker than split-grading
for identical results by using the following technique. With negatives, we
expose for the shadows, then develop to bring the highlights to the correct
density. With positive prints, the technique is naturally the exact
opposite. We expose for the highlights, then adjust shadow density in
processing. This adjustment is made in the print not by development time,
but by VC filtration alteration.
So I make a test strip at a guessed contrast grade (I can usually get pretty
close by looking at the neg., but I can use a densitometer if so inclined),
then examine the highlights. I look for the area that I want to be just not
paper base white. When I find this, which sets print exposure time, I then
look at the area in the print which I want to be just black within that
particular correct-exposure-step of the test strip. If it doesn't reach
black, I need to increase contrast grade. If it does reach it along with
some other areas that I don't want to reach black, I need to decrease
contrast grade.
As I said, I am usually pretty close with my first grade guess. If any
adjustment is needed in VC grade of 1/2 grade or less, I find that I do not
need to adjust exposure time. If the adjustment is more than 1/2 grade, a
second test strip is needed. I would estimate that I don't need a second
test strip about 50% of the time.
The trouble with most single-filter printers, even the very experienced
ones, I find when coaching them in my workshops is that they try and assess
their test strips for both contrast and density at the same time using some
middle tone as a general guide. They thus have two variables. Exposing for
the print highlight, and adjusting shadows by contrast grade cures this.
But that's my way. If you find it quicker to split grade, no problem. It's
what works for you that counts. We both arrive at the same result!

The ongoing split-filter vs single filter debate seems to me to be veering
towards what could best be described as a heated agreement...  At the end
of the day, whatever technique we use the object is to match the contrast
range of the paper to the contrast range of the negative.  

Paper's response to light is straightforward - the more light you give it
the more density you get.  It doesn't matter if it's a lot of light for a
short period, or less light for longer (yes OK I know about reciprocity
failure but I'm trying to keep it simple!) - it's simply the volume of blue
and green light which produces the result.

To summarise:

The single filter method.  Adjust the exposure time for the highlights and
the filter setting for the shadows. Filtration alters the ratio of green
and blue in the light hitting the paper, so we end up with X amount of
green light and Y amount of blue light.

The split filter method. Make separate exposures through maximum
filtration. By adjusting the relative exposures to place the highlights and
shadows correctly we again end up with X amount of green light and Y amount
of blue light. 

Both methods achieve the same result - an adjustment to the total "volume"
of green and blue light that the paper sees, which is what it responds to.

Leaving aside the issue of print manipulation by dodging and burning at
different filter settings, the end result is exactly the same so just use
whichever method you're comfortable with, and please stop arguing about it :-)

Richard

Dear ListMembers,
	I'm new to the list. Brazilian, 39yo, living in Brazil's capital.
I'm developing and printing my b&w films at home and am still learning the
basics (film calibration, paper calibration, use of filters for b&w, etc.).
I'd like to see examples of b&w prints made by the listmembers; are there
web sites of listmembers that show their work?

	Thanks for your attention.

	Regards,

	Helio

You're imagining things Steve :-)

"...variable contrast papers are a blend of emulsion components of
differing spectral sensitization.

When the paper is exposed to blue light, all parts of the emulsion react
and contribute equally to the final image.  This image is of high
contrast because of the additive effect produced by the three emulsions
with the same speed and contrast.

When the paper is exposed to green light, only the parts of the emulsion
with the larger amounts of green sensitizing dye react initially.  This
is because the three emulsions have very different sensitivities to
green light.  The resultant curve has a very much wider exposure range
and is thus of low contrast.

By varying the proportion of blue to green light, a contrast range
between these two extremes can be obtained..."

Note 

1) a BLEND of emulsion components (not layers)
2) THREE emulsions (not just two)
3) ALL emulsions are sensitive to both green and blue light (but with
different speeds)
4) no mention of masking
5) All (three) emulsions have a similar contrast

Note that other manufacturers may use a different number of emulsions,
but it doesn't have to be 2, and exposure of one doesn't mask the other
(how could it?).

I have not followed all of this discussion, so I may be repeting what
someone else has already said. I f so, my apologies.

I use RH Design's Analyser to determine exposure time and gradation for
enlargements. The analyser allows the relative sensitivity (read exposure
times) of five different paper brands to be stored in its memory, and not
only this, it also stores the relative sensitivity of five grades for each
paper. OK, it takes some time to calibrate the thing, but once it is done,
the Analyser will will automatically adjust the exposure time when you tell
it you are using another paper grade. It also allows you to vary exposure
time in steps that are always constant, e.i. you basically adjust the
exposure times in steps of one-fifth f-stop, rather than in a number of
seconds, the latter beings something which will have different effect
dependig if your basic exposure was 8 or 45 seconds.  I think the new model
can be made to work in 1/12 and 1/8 stop steps too.

Dear ListMembers,
	Thanks to Lorrena and Eric. I've already taken a quick look at the
sites and liked very much what I saw; that was exactly what I expected to
see. Eric's tech info pages are great for people who, like me, are looking
for tech info and opinions on equipment (i.e. diffusion/conderser enlarger
gave me some new info I didn't know about). At Lorrena's site I found some
inspiring images both for the technical aspect (nicely print) and for the
aesthetic aspect (fountain2.jpg was eye pleasing for me). This are my first
impressions after a quick look at them, they deserve a closer and longer
look. Once again, thanks to Lorrena and Eric.

	Regards,

	Hlio

Now there's an idea! I'll go with that one.  ;-))
Tim
By the way Barry, an unsolicited plug - I have just yesterday through the
backlog  to printing some of the FP4 I dev'd in your DiXactol single bath.
Fantastic quality and sharpness. I'm very pleased and impressed

Hi ListMembers,
	Thanks to Richard for answering to my email.

	I have just seen those few images. May I ask you a question about
one of them? What were you thinking when you shot "Tree of Life"? The first
thing I thought of when I saw it was Joyce Kilmer's poem "Trees" (I think I
shall never see a poem lovely as a tree, ...)

	Regards,

	Helio

The real question is a simple one. No matter what method you use, how do
your images look?

This one is taking on the 'zone or die' mentality, so why not spend some
darkroom time creating good images with whatever method works for you.

To all, 

It seems as if we're getting close to being a "pure-silver, dowsing, 
ley-lines and homeopathy" mailing list.  I wonder what will be next.

I think updating is a constant. It seems like a never ending process.

A month or so ago, I asked the list its view of commercial sponsorship and/or
'shareware' type fees for helping maintain the ongoing presence of pure-silver.
The consensus was that sponsorship was the way to go. (One person even 
volunteered to host the list - very kind, but I dislike this option because
it makes my admin task a much harder than I like.  We tried this in the past
and adding/deleting users and correcting problems on a remote machine 
was a real pain for me.)

While I continue to consider the sponsorship possibility, as of this week, I've
upgraded the server upon which pure-silver is hosted at my own expense.  The
machine which was running this list was ancient and on its last legs.  I was
able to scrounge up enough pieces and parts and added a new motherboard with
the requisite memory so that we should be fine for the forseeable future.

The list continues to exceed my expectations for quality, class, and relevance.
While I do not read every thread in detail, it is clear that *you* have 
created an unusual community - competent, helpful, and most of all, very
polite (a rare thing on the Net these days, and even rarer in the real world).
With almost 250 subscribers, we are at (almost) an all-time record high
membership - do encourage others to join, BTW, the machine should be able
to take the load now ;))

As I mentioned, I am still actively considering some form of sponsorship
program - I'll let you know when/if this comes to pass.

Happy Independence Day to my US colleagues and a lovely Wednesday to the
rest of you...

Well,
I sincerely withdraw my claim regarding the actuall manufacture of these
papers.

But, I repeat that tests, like Hicks' below and what Davis wrote about are
hard to support when youj take a print which prints normally and then apply
the split filter concepts, if it was printed with all developed
possibilities normally there won't be a change any other way.

There's always more than one way to make the same print.  Rarly can anybody
see a difference.

But, taking a difficult print; especially one with lots of sky, clouds and
shadows under trees; or people with hats on their heads standing in open
sunshing.  THEN, with normal printing and lots of dodging on the one hand,
and split contrast on the other it becomes simply a more easily manipulable
technique to make the print with the filtration to do the work.

Some folks are right handed and some left, so how do you teach one to hold
the dodging tool?  Me ... I say, "Hold it under the light."

:)

I have designed a step tablet (read: big test strip method) that will
resolve questions on any print within .033% or one third of ten percent of
any exposure, threshold.

I have every respect to exactly what you said, and I would only say the same
with different wording.

The single phrase that's creeped into our vocabulary since the last
publication of Looten's on  Photographic Printing and Enlargment is the
terms that fully describe the desired product.

The term for shadow detail adjustment as "Contrast"  should be 'contrast
range.'  If you re read what's concluded above, and incert the word range in
the end, it's great text.

Dear ListMembers,
    I'm new to the list. Brazilian, 39yo, living in Brazil's capital.
I'm developing and printing my b&w films at home and am still learning the
basics (film calibration, paper calibration, use of filters for b&w, etc.).
I'd like to see examples of b&w prints made by the listmembers; are there
web sites of listmembers that show their work?

    Thanks for your attention.

    Regards,

Hi Christer,
The current version will store data for up to 8 different papers, each with
exposure and contrast calibration settings for 7 full grades, 00 to 5.
Half-grades are interpolated. Not only will it tell you the new exposure
time if you change grade, but you can also change *paper* - for example you
can change the setting from Ilford to Agfa paper and compare the results on
the greyscale without actually having to make a print.

You can choose 1/3, 1/4, 1/6 or 1/12 stop steps so you have coarse or fine
control. The finer steps are useful at the harder grade settings.  Older
models can be upgraded to the current specification, contact me off list if
you're interested.

Regards
Richard

Hi Helio,

>	I have just seen those few images. May I ask you a question about

That's a very good question!  To be honest, all I remember thinking was
that it was an image that *had* to be made, and I was mostly concerned with
getting back to the car through the snow to pick up my RB67 and get back
there before the light went; the only camera I had with me had colour slide
film in it, so I took a couple of quick ones just in case ...  The image
does different things for different people - some love it and some don't
like it at all but very few are indifferent.  A camera club judge said she
would prefer the wall running diagonally, but you can't win them all ;-)
For me, it's the symmetry and the graphical strength of the image that
works, the feeling that you're almost connected to the tree via the wall.
And I simply like trees.  My sister likes the way the whole thing seems to
spring out from her belly-button!  The snow makes it, I've been back there
during the summer and to be honest, I'd probably have walked straight past
if I hadn't known it was there.  The print was made on Agfa MCC, at grade 5
plus a white light flash exposure to bring in the subtle highlight detail.
The film was APX100 developed in Rodinal.

Regards
Richard

Hi ListMembers,
	Wow! Thanks to all that are answering my email! I'm having lots of
fun looking at the sites. Mr. Spedding's "Images from my past" are something
to hang on the wall! I hope in a few weeks I'll be able to show some of my
prints too.

	In one of the sites there is a link to a photographer that shows
images from Siberia ... stunning for someone like me (I live in a tropical
country and I've never seen snow).

	Once again thanks to all that answered to my email.

	Regards,

	Helio

Hi Richard,
	Thanks for answering my question about the "Tree of Life". Looking
again at the image I saw a cross-like pattern on it; also, for me, the tree
looks like somebody with arms spread and looking to the sky (well ... my
imagination is flying ...).

	Don't fail to tell us when you update those pages!

Barry,

I cannot agree with your comment that split grade printing is "mumbo jumbo". In theory it is possible to achieve the same result with a single filtered exposure. However, the question that begs to be asked is how do you determine the exact single filtration value to match a split graded print. I have not yet received a satisfactory answer to that question. With lots of tests and in some cases densitometer readings I guess that it is possible. Testing takes time and not many photographers own densitometers. 

I have followed this thread with interest and a lot of good points have been made. The colour of the filtration, the layers of emulsion, although I think that the myth that there are up to three layers has been well and truly shot down, have been discussed in great depth. It seems to me that the most critical factor in the equation has not been fully covered. 
That factor is the negative. It has been my experience that the negative is the key to split grade printing. The simple fact is that if the negative has enough overall contrast, and density in the highlights then it becomes a mask and in effect dodges for you while you are exposing, particularly the hard filtration. I have made high contrast negatives for some 6 or 7 years to use in split grade printing. I guess that I am producing a first generation negative which will do a similar job as Howard Bond's unsharp masking technique which is why I have never bothered to explore the method. 

I expose the soft filtration (grade 0) first to determine the tonality of the highlight. Having decided the exposure to achieve the highlight TONE I expose a second test strip where the full soft exposure is first given followed by a series steps using hard filtration (grade 5). The resultant test strip allows me to choose which step gives me the contrast and density I feel best for the subject. Unlike many printers I lay the hard filtration test on top of the soft exposure that I have previously determined. In effect I control my contrast by very accurate timing of both exposures. In my view to make two totally independent test strips, ie one soft and one hard, and then lay one on top of the other is pointless. You must determine how much tone is on the paper from one exposure before you can decide how much exposure to give the second. By mixing as I do I am creating my own grade, I prefer to refer to it as contrast. Another useful aspect of this method is that I can produc!
 e !
several different levels of contrast on one test strip which has to be an efficient use of both time and materials. By simply increasing or reducing the exposure given to either filtration I can change my contrast, either global or local. I feel that the method gives me total control at all times. The one thing that I would say is that split grade printing does not work with every negative.

Like you Barry, some of my income is earned by printing for other photographers where we have to be quick and still make first class prints, Given that I have a negative with good contrast I aim to make a fine print in 20 to 30 minutes. I would think that my standard negative would have many printers throwing up their hands in horror such is the level of contrast that I aim for, but the important thing to me is that it works for me. 75% of both my personal and professional work is done using the methods that I have briefly described and I can say that the amount of burning and dodging is reduced compared to when I use graded paper or a single grade for the same negative. There are many ways to make fine prints and they all work for the printer concerned. With respect I think that your mumbo jumbo comment does not take that into account.

All,
I have followed this with interest as I am a split grade printer.  I guess 
I missed the point of making two independent test strips and then putting 
the exposures together.  Like Les, I make one test and then use that time 
on the next test strip and then make my new test strip on top of the first 
test print.  This is the way to integrate the two test exposures.

Unlike Les, I don't think it matters at all which color filter is laid down 
first.  For me when I was printing using filters what was the determining 
factor was which filter was in the filter holder.  I first used Yellow (0) 
and Magenta (5) and then switched to Green 58 and Blue 47b.  Now I am using 
a VCL 4500 by Aristo.

All,<br>
I have followed this with interest as I am a split grade printer.&nbsp; I
guess I missed the point of making two independent test strips and then
putting the exposures together.&nbsp; Like Les, I make one test and then
use that time on the next test strip and then make my new test strip on
top of the first test print.&nbsp; This is the way to integrate the two
test exposures. <br>
<br>
Unlike Les, I don't think it matters at all which color filter is laid
down first.&nbsp; For me when I was printing using filters what was the
determining factor was which filter was in the filter holder.&nbsp; I
first used Yellow (0) and Magenta (5) and then switched to Green 58 and
Blue 47b.&nbsp; Now I am using a VCL 4500 by Aristo.<br>

I cannot agree with your comment that split grade printing is &quot;mumbo
jumbo&quot;. In theory it is possible to achieve the same result with a
single filtered exposure. However, the question that begs to be asked is
how do you determine the exact single filtration value to match a split
graded print. I have not yet received a satisfactory answer to that
question. With lots of tests and in some cases densitometer readings I
guess that it is possible. Testing takes time and not many photographers
own densitometers. <br>
<br>
I have followed this thread with interest and a lot of good points have
been made. The colour of the filtration, the layers of emulsion, although
I think that the myth that there are up to three layers has been well and
truly shot down, have been discussed in great depth. It seems to me that
the most critical factor in the equation has not been fully covered.
<br>
That factor is the negative. It has been my experience that the negative
is the key to split grade printing. The simple fact is that if the
negative has enough overall contrast, and density in the highlights then
it becomes a mask and in effect dodges for you while you are exposing,
particularly the hard filtration. I have made high contrast negatives for
some 6 or 7 years to use in split grade printing. I guess that I am
producing a first generation negative which will do a similar job as
Howard Bond's unsharp masking technique which is why I have never
bothered to explore the method. <br>
<br>
I expose the soft filtration (grade 0) first to determine the tonality of
the highlight. Having decided the exposure to achieve the highlight TONE
I expose a second test strip where the full soft exposure is first given
followed by a series steps using hard filtration (grade 5). The resultant
test strip allows me to choose which step gives me the contrast and
density I feel best for the subject. Unlike many printers I lay the hard
filtration test on top of the soft exposure that I have previously
determined. In effect I control my contrast by very accurate timing of
both exposures. In my view to make two totally independent test strips,
ie one soft and one hard, and then lay one on top of the other is
pointless. You must determine how much tone is on the paper from one
exposure before you can decide how much exposure to give the second. By
mixing as I do I am creating my own grade, I prefer to refer to it as
contrast. Another useful aspect of this method is that I can produce
!<br>
several different levels of contrast on one test strip which has to be an
efficient use of both time and materials. By simply increasing or
reducing the exposure given to either filtration I can change my
contrast, either global or local. I feel that the method gives me total
control at all times. The one thing that I would say is that split grade
printing does not work with every negative.<br>
<br>
Like you Barry, some of my income is earned by printing for other
photographers where we have to be quick and still make first class
prints, Given that I have a negative with good contrast I aim to make a
fine print in 20 to 30 minutes. I would think that my standard negative
would have many printers throwing up their hands in horror such is the
level of contrast that I aim for, but the important thing to me is that
it works for me. 75% of both my personal and professional work is done

Les - You don't start with a split print and then try to find a single
exposure that will match it. Since you know in advance that anything you do
with a split print can be duplicated with a single exposure, you forget
about split printing and just use a single exposure to make whatever test
strips, proofs, etc. you use in order to arrive at the exposure and contrast
you want for the final print. At least that's what I do.  I confess that I
haven't taken the time to completely follow the methodology that you
describe and that apparently works for you, so possibly just working from a
single exposure and forgetting about split printing isn't doable with your
system, in which case you do what works as I think we all agree.

printers throwing up their hands in horror such is the level of contrast
that I aim for, but the important thing to me is that it works for me. 75%

  Yes, but you've certainly pointed out the pain-in-the-posterior factor
involved in trying to get a match as exact as possible. I think the only
reason I did it was that I wanted to prove Phil wrong since I knew I could
_see_ a difference. <G>
  Never again.

  When I've done split-filter printing I've done it the way you described
and it worked fine; I suppose I'm so used to just using a single filter
that it just wasn't worth the effort to change for no significant
difference. I do, however, routinely use soft or hard filters for burning etc.

Hi,

While people are exchanging URLs, could I suggest the following for
Dronfield Camera Club, which is based in Derbyshire, United Kingdom:

http://www.dronfieldcamera.fsnet.co.uk

The gallery has a little of my own monochrome work (mostly infrared) and
some excellent toned monochrome landscapes by Pete Burkett.

Best wishes

Guy

After I have been away for a while I retrieve my Emails and find that the
pure-silver group is very hard to keep straight due to the different time
zones we live in and the time-stamp that computers use.. Sometimes this
makes following a thread difficult. Any thoughts as to what might help?

As you're using Outlook, in the 'View' choose 'Threaded', and the messages
should be shown on your screen grouped by subject and presented as a
cronological list. Hopefully...

  Greetings-

  I would like to bring to the list's attention the recent release of a book
entitled, BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHY - MANIFEST VISIONS/ AN INTERNATIONAL
COLLECTION, by James Luciana (Rockport Publishers, Gloucester, MA).

  It a collection of work by several dozen photographers, some familiar -
many not, and is a truly fine piece of work on James' part.  It seems to be
widely available - I understand Borders is stocking it.....  It's definitely
worth a look.

  Best -

  Jon Bailey

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from Brad Brace.
The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it
suspends identity, relations and history. This discourse, far from
determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which
it could find support. It is trying to operate a decentering that leaves
no privilege to any center. 


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project        
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events... 

	A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual impact;
an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present of the
Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone... 

                              [ see ftp.netcom.com/pub/bb/bbrace/books ]

KEYWORDS: >> Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
   de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous, reckless...
>> Multi-faceted, oblique, obsessive, obscure, obdurate...
>> Promulgated, personal, permeable, prolonged, polymorphous, provocative,
   poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic, pathological, pointless...
>> Emergent, evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,
   entertaining, evasive, entropic, erotic, entrancing, enduring,
   expansive...

	Every 12 hours, another!...  view them, re-post `em, save `em,
trade `em, print `em, even publish them... 

Here`s how:

~ Set www-links to ->  http://www.teleport.com/~bbrace/12hr.html
                   ->  http://bbrace.laughingsquid.net/12hr.html

  Look for the 12-hr-icon. Heavy traffic may require you to specify files
  more than once! Anarchie, Fetch, CuteFTP, TurboGopher... 
  Or -> ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/bb/bbrace/bbrace.html

~ Download from ->  ftp.pacifier.com  /pub/users/bbrace
  Download from ->  ftp.netcom.com  /pub/bb/bbrace
  Download from ->  ftp.teleport.com  /users/bbrace
  Download from ->  ftp.rdrop.com   /pub/users/bbrace
  Download from ->  ftp.eskimo.com  /u/b/bbrace
  * Remember to set tenex or binary. Get 12hr.jpeg

~ E-mail -> If you only have access to email, then you can use FTPmail to
  do essentially the same thing. Send a message with a body of 'help' to the
  server address nearest you: 
  *
  ftpmail@ccc.uba.ar			ftpmail@cs.uow.edu.au
  ftpmail@ftp.uni-stuttgart.de		ftpmail@ftp.Dartmouth.edu
  ftpmail@ieunet.ie			ftpmail@src.doc.ic.ac.uk

  bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu		bitftp@pucc.bitnet
  *					*  


~ Mirror-sites requested! Archives too! 
  The latest new jpeg will always be named, 12hr.jpeg
  Average size of images is only 45K.
  *
  Perl program to mirror ftp-sites/sub-directories:
  src.doc.ic.ac.uk:/packages/mirror
  *

~ Postings to usenet newsgroups:
  alt.12hr
  alt.binaries.pictures.12hr
  alt.binaries.pictures.misc
  alt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.misc
 
* * Ask your system's news-administrator to carry these groups!
  (There are also usenet image browsers: TIFNY, PluckIt, Picture Agent,
    PictureView, Extractor97, NewsRover, Binary News Assistant, EasyNews) 

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest on
December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years` worth
of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour posting
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation. 

~ The sites listed above also contain information on other cultural
projects and sources. 

~ A very low-volume, moderated mailing list for announcements and
occasional commentary related to this project has been established. Send
e-mail to:  listserv@netcom.com /subscribe 12hr-isbn-jpeg

--
This project has not received government art-subsidies. Some opportunities
still exist for financially assisting the publication of editions of large
(33x46") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet duotones on newsprint!
Other supporters receive rare copies of the first three web-offset printed
ISBN-Books.

ISBN is International Standard Book Number. JPEG and GIF are types of
image files. Get the text-file, 'pictures-faq' to learn how to view or
translate these images. [ftp ftp.netcom.com/pub/bb/bbrace]

I agree 100% but it's a question of general nettiquite, which  is hard to
teach without flame wars.

It's a matter of changing the subject line slightly or greatly when making a
rply.

  Our list got spammed. The message advertising "Western Web" was spam.
  Please do NOT send "remove" messages to the Pure Silver list, they will 
just show up here as messages. If you reply to the spam otherwise you will 
just repeat it again to the whole list.
   The list administrator must block the address from which it came.
   It is beginning to become common for e-mail spammers to post to mailing 
lists. It insures them of a large audience for their spam.
   Nothing can be done about this by list members, list administrators can 
complain to the ISPs originating the spam or block ISPs unless they are 
among the larger ones. Then you would be blocking all mail from them to the 
list.
   I don't think these folks will be back.
   As a rule when you send a "remove" message to a spammer it just confirms 
your e-mail address and you will get yourself on more spamming lists. Many 
spammers send out BCC messages to randomly generated addresses hoping that 
a reasonable percentage of them will be actual addresses, again, responding 
to the "remove" address simply confirms that an actual e-mail address has 
been used and it becomes a target for further spamming.

  There is a good explanation of how VC paper works and how it is made in
_Ilford Monochrome Darkroom Practice_ second edition, Jack H. Coote, The 
Focal Press.  I have the second edition but I believe there is a third or 
even later one now.
   This book also has good explanations of how emulsions for both film and 
paper are made and how film and paper are manufactured, with drawings of 
the coating machines, etc.

I use Eudora which seems to be able to sort messages into the correct time
order based on the time stamp *plus* the GMT offset.  So for example Guy
Brown's msg stamped 09:55 +0100 appears before your one stamped 09:48
-0400.  I also set it up to filter all incoming P-S msgs into a specific
mailbox - and if I do nothing else they're in the order in which they
arrived which must mean that questions and answers are in roughly the right
order :-)

I know that when you make a test strip and you want a linear relation in
increasing density one should use Fstop printing times instead of linear
times: so instead of 5, 7.5, 10, 15, 20 sec it should be 5, 7.1, 10,
14.1 and 20 sec for a linear relationship between print density and
time.

Somehow I am not able to understand this on theoretical level: why is a
half stop more light from say 5 sec 7.1 sec and not 7.5 sec?

Could somebody ( Richard R, Richard K....?..;-)..) explain?

This is Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE) sometimes referred to as
SPAM (which is actually a specific form of USENET abuse).  I know Tim
allows ads, but I'm sure he means photo related ads and not livestock.

"Western Web" did this by sending a message to pure-silver (if the
list is open (i.e., you don't have to subscribe to send messages)), or
by subscribing and sending the message, assuming that the list owner
would delete their subscription when he found out what happened.

Do not send "remove" messages to the list (because no one here can do
anything about it) or directly to "Western Web".  By sending a
"remove" message to someone who deliberately sends UCE all you are
doing is helping them confirm which email addresses are valid.  Right
now "Western Web" does not have the individual email addresses of
pure-silver subscribers.  They will if you reply to them directly.

Thanks for the advice!
My defaults do put email in the time-stamp order { irregardless of GMT } if
I have been away long and that messes up the order - it actually puts the
messages that arrive in front or behind according to time stamp. { I often
get over 100 emails a day so it is a pain.
I might try the Eudora tip as I have a free copy somewhere.
Thanks again,
Chuck

Dear ListMembers,
	At Mr. Eric Boutilier-Brown's site I read a brief explanation of the
differences between diffusion and condenser enlargers. That text aroused my
curiosity about this subject. Could someone please, be so kind, in telling
me where could I get more info on this subject?

	Thanks.

	Regards,

   A stop is defined as the ratio of change in diameter of the iris that 
results in a doubling or halving of the light. The ratio of light is given 
by 2^x where x = the number of stops. Example: one stop,  2^1 = 2;  two 
stops, 2^2 = 4;  one half stop, 2^0.5 = 1.414  So half a stop more than 5 
seconds is 5 * 1.414 = 7.07

   Since the amount of light transmitted by the iris is proportional to 
area it is proportional to the square of the stop number where f/ is 
defined as the ratio of FL/diameter of stop. The ratio of the light is 
proprotional to (f/a / f/b)^2

   7.5 seconds would be correct if the light changed in a linear way with 
the stop numbers rather than as to the square of their ratio.

   This is the best I can do so early in the morning.

   If you are interested in Callier effect its covered in many texts on optics.
   Most condenser enlargers are actually combination sources. The lamp is a 
relatively large, highly diffuse, source, which is imaged approximately on 
the entrance pupil of the enlarging lens. The difference between this and a 
completely diffuse source like a typical dichroic color head amounts to a 
moderate difference in image contrast.
   Callier effect is caused by the scattering of light from very small 
particals. The smaller the particals and the thinner the layer in which 
they are contained the less scattering there is and the less difference in 
transmission between a diffuse and specular source.
   For the type of partially diffusing condenser mentioned above the 
difference in contrast amounts to about one paper grade for ordinary 
black-and-white negatives with silver images. For color materials, where 
the image consists of very fine dye particals there is virtually no 
scattering so the contrast is nearly independant of the type of source.
   For making large color prints a truely specular point-source type of 
lamphouse is sometimes used. This results in sharper rendition of the image 
at the cost of exagerating any blemish on the film. Such sources are very 
rarely used for ordinary work.
   A diffusion source has the advantage of paritally suppressing blemishes. 
However, this can sometimes be misleading. For B&W work, where there is a 
difference in the image contrast between the two types a negative of given 
contast must be printed on lower contrast paper on the condenser enlarger. 
The lower paper contrast will tend to suppress negative blemishes. If a 
negative with contrast matched to the condenser enlarger is used on a 
diffusion enlarger a higher constast paper must be used which will tend to 
pick up the blemishes. For color work the diffusion source will definitely 
help to reduce the visibility of blemishes.
   The type of source is important if you are making densitometric 
measurements. The densitometer source must match the printing source is the 
measurements are to be meaningful.
   This is covered in any text on densitometry or sensitometry.

Everything to do with photographic exposure is logarithmic.  Look at these
number sequences:

2, 4, 8, 16, 30, 60, 125, 250, 500 [1/ shutter speeds]
2, 2.8, 4, 5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32 [lens apertures]

Shutter speed doubles or halves from one step to the next.
Lens aperture numbers double or halve every *other* step. Aperture is
expressed as a diameter which is the focal length of the lens divided by 2,
2.8 etc.  These represent full stops since lens aperture is an *area* - if
you increase the diameter (which is what f/8 means) by a factor of 2, the
area increases by a factor of 4.  So to get double the area, you multiply
the diameter by the square root of 2 (1.414)

An exposure is always expressed as a combination of a shutter speed and an
aperture, e.g 1/60th at f/8.  If you increase one by a given factor,  and
decrease the other by the same factor, you get the same exposure value.
1/15th at f/16 = 1/60th at f/8 for example.

The same is true when printing - I expect you know that if your print is
correctly exposed at 10 secs at f/8, then 20 secs at f/11 will give you the
same result. And at f/16, you need not 30 secs but *40*.  The density of
the print increases proportionally with the *square* of the exposure time.
So half a stop up from 5 sec is 5x1.414 or 7.1 sec.  That is why an f-stop
printing sequence is not linear - take these two examples of test strip
exposures:

5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30
5.6, 8, 11, 16, 22, 32

The first one will give you a test strip with a wide difference in density
between the two shortest exposures, and much less difference between the
last two.  The second one, and the numbers should be familiar, will give
you consistent density changes. In terms of print exposure time, these
numbers are in half-stops.

It makes perfect sense to use a system of exposure time adjustments that
give you linear changes of print density because after a little practice
you can judge printing adjustments in terms of f-stops.  So you can make a
proof print at a small size noting the f-stop relationship between the
various exposures, and then make your final print at 20x16 or whatever
using the *same f-stop relationships* and you'll get the same result.  You
can look at a proof print and decide that an area needs a quarter-stop
burn-in for example - and you don't need to consider the original exposure
to make that judgement.

Expressing print exposure changes in seconds is like measuring volume in
inches - it can be done, but it doesn't make a lot of sense.  90% of the
time when printing, we're interested in exposure *changes*, not the
absolute exposure, and a system that expresses exposure in terms of what
you see on the print seems to me to be the best way to do it.

I was sufficiently convinced by this method of printing that I sank a lot
of money into starting a business to make enlarger timers that work this
way - all of them work in simple, equal steps of print density, fine or
coarse according to taste. SIx years on, I'm pleased to say that nobody has
yet returned a StopClock saying they didn't agree :-)

Good news Tim. Thanks for the info.
Incidentally, I was born on the 4th July. Does your message about US
Independence Day mean that my birthday is not the reason why America
celebrates every year?

Subject:	Update On pure-silver Sponsorship

A month or so ago, I asked the list its view of commercial sponsorship
and/or
'shareware' type fees for helping maintain the ongoing presence of
pure-silver.
The consensus was that sponsorship was the way to go. (One person even
volunteered to host the list - very kind, but I dislike this option because
it makes my admin task a much harder than I like.  We tried this in the past
and adding/deleting users and correcting problems on a remote machine
was a real pain for me.)

While I continue to consider the sponsorship possibility, as of this week,
I've
upgraded the server upon which pure-silver is hosted at my own expense.  The
machine which was running this list was ancient and on its last legs.  I was
able to scrounge up enough pieces and parts and added a new motherboard with
the requisite memory so that we should be fine for the forseeable future.

The list continues to exceed my expectations for quality, class, and
relevance.
While I do not read every thread in detail, it is clear that *you* have
created an unusual community - competent, helpful, and most of all, very
polite (a rare thing on the Net these days, and even rarer in the real
world).
With almost 250 subscribers, we are at (almost) an all-time record high
membership - do encourage others to join, BTW, the machine should be able
to take the load now ;))

As I mentioned, I am still actively considering some form of sponsorship
program - I'll let you know when/if this comes to pass.

Happy Independence Day to my US colleagues and a lovely Wednesday to the
rest of you...

"I cannot agree with your comment that split grade printing is "mumbo
jumbo". In theory it is possible to achieve the same result with a single
filtered exposure. However, the question that begs to be asked is how do you
determine the exact single filtration value to match a split graded print. I
have not yet received a satisfactory answer to that question. With lots of
tests and in some cases densitometer readings I guess that it is possible.
Testing takes time and not many photographers own densitometers.

I have followed this thread with interest and a lot of good points have been
made. The colour of the filtration, the layers of emulsion, although I think
that the myth that there are up to three layers has been well and truly shot
down, have been discussed in great depth. It seems to me that the most
critical factor in the equation has not been fully covered.
That factor is the negative. It has been my experience that the negative is
the key to split grade printing. The simple fact is that if the negative has
enough overall contrast, and density in the highlights then it becomes a
mask and in effect dodges for you while you are exposing, particularly the
hard filtration. I have made high contrast negatives for some 6 or 7 years
to use in split grade printing. I guess that I am producing a first
generation negative which will do a similar job as Howard Bond's unsharp
masking technique which is why I have never bothered to explore the method.
"

Les
I think we are at the point which Richard Ross so beautifully described as
"heated agreement" I didn't and don't say that split grade printing is
mumbo-jumbo. I did and do say that many weird and wonderful claims made for
the technique are mumbo-jumbo. There are many people who believe, as a
result of these claims, that split grading in some way produces tones in the
paper not possible with single filtering. This is pure balderdash.
But split grading is a perfectly valid technique if you prefer to work this
way. That's what I said in my posting. The technique you use is exactly the
equivalent of that I described I use in my single filter approach  i.e. I
set print exposure for the key highlight tone in the print, then adjust
contrast by to bring the shadows to the right point. My VC head is
completely stepless, so I can get as precise a match to correct contrast as
with split grading. We effectively do it the same way Les. I don't set out
to match a split graded print as you seem to suggest - I set out to achieve
the contrast grade of print to match the negative I am printing via a simple
test strip. I don't understand why you think that this would require a
densitometer.
I am very interested in the point you are making about overdeveloped
negative highlights becoming a mask. I must admit that I can't understand
the logic of this. It certainly doesn't replicate the unsharp mask technique
which, in these circumstances, would mask the shadow areas, not the
highlights. Also unsharp masking adds to apparent image sharpness by
heightened edge effects. I can't see how over-dense negative highlights
would do this. In fact, far from a masking effect, it seems to me that
over-dense highlights would cause shadow and middle tones to compress and
print too darkly before the highlight areas would begin to print. Also, the
highlight tones would begin to go over the shoulder of the negative's
characteristic curve so that, when they did eventually print, they would
also be somewhat compressed with a tendency to mottling. Certainly, this is
the experience I get with the many overdeveloped negatives I receive from
clients to print.
One thing I do know is that overdevelopment has a very bad effect on
graininess and sharpness, much more so relatively than overexposure.
However, it is clear that I am missing the point you are making about
negative self masking. Could you elucidate Les?

By the way Barry, an unsolicited plug - I have just yesterday through the
backlog  to printing some of the FP4 I dev'd in your DiXactol single bath.
Fantastic quality and sharpness. I'm very pleased and impressed

Well, I think we were going to call it 'Barry' Day, and then it was
'To hell with King George Day', but we finally settled on 'Independence
Day'.  'Sorry, you didn't make the cut ;)))

   If you are interested in Callier effect its covered in many texts on
optics.
   Most condenser enlargers are actually combination sources. The lamp is a
relatively large, highly diffuse, source, which is imaged approximately on
the entrance pupil of the enlarging lens. The difference between this and a
completely diffuse source like a typical dichroic color head amounts to a
moderate difference in image contrast.
   Callier effect is caused by the scattering of light from very small
particals. The smaller the particals and the thinner the layer in which
they are contained the less scattering there is and the less difference in
transmission between a diffuse and specular source.
   For the type of partially diffusing condenser mentioned above the
difference in contrast amounts to about one paper grade for ordinary
black-and-white negatives with silver images. For color materials, where
the image consists of very fine dye particals there is virtually no
scattering so the contrast is nearly independant of the type of source.
   For making large color prints a truely specular point-source type of
lamphouse is sometimes used. This results in sharper rendition of the image
at the cost of exagerating any blemish on the film. Such sources are very
rarely used for ordinary work.
   A diffusion source has the advantage of paritally suppressing blemishes.
However, this can sometimes be misleading. For B&W work, where there is a
difference in the image contrast between the two types a negative of given
contast must be printed on lower contrast paper on the condenser enlarger.
The lower paper contrast will tend to suppress negative blemishes. If a
negative with contrast matched to the condenser enlarger is used on a
diffusion enlarger a higher constast paper must be used which will tend to
pick up the blemishes. For color work the diffusion source will definitely
help to reduce the visibility of blemishes.
   The type of source is important if you are making densitometric
measurements. The densitometer source must match the printing source is the
measurements are to be meaningful.
   This is covered in any text on densitometry or sensitometry.

The first one will give you a test strip with a wide difference in density
between the two shortest exposures, and much less difference between the
last two.  The second one, and the numbers should be familiar, will give
you consistent density changes. In terms of print exposure time, these
numbers are in half-stops." (Aren't they full stops Richard?)

I don't think it would be wise to get into an f stop war like the recent and
current split-grading thread Richard. So I'll limit myself to this brief
comment. We have no need to fall out on this one. No doubt F stop timing
works BUT you do normally have to get into fractional f stops for fine
enough steps, and you WOULDN'T in real life make test strips of 5, 10, 15,
20, 25, 30 seconds. Much more likely, for a roughly estimated exposure time
of, say, 16 seconds, would be 12, 14, 16, 18, 20 second steps. Here the
differences would be much less variable, and are quite enough to see and
judge. No programming is necessary of the timer.
Variations in exposure, to say burn in or hold back portions of a print, are
equally easy as percentages of total time.
To other thread readers, may I emphasise that this is not a criticism of
Richard's timers. They are excellent. I use one myself, and it gives the
option of f stop or 'straight' timing to choice. So, if you don't have one,
shame on you. Buy one immediately!

If you want it to wash up over here you might want to learn about the proper
way to spell harbor or you'll get tea all over your white cliffs.  We yanks
have been appalled by the spelling you Brits have sunk toward but I think
that Barry might be excused due to the July,4th birthdate if he can just get
'color" right on his spell checker. At least you guys haven't sunk all the
way to the complete metric system and might still be able to understand the
finer points of measurement.  :o)

   If you are interested in Callier effect its covered in many texts on
optics.
   Most condenser enlargers are actually combination sources. The lamp is a
relatively large, highly diffuse, source, which is imaged approximately on
the entrance pupil of the enlarging lens. The difference between this and a
completely diffuse source like a typical dichroic color head amounts to a
moderate difference in image contrast.
   Callier effect is caused by the scattering of light from very small
particals. The smaller the particals and the thinner the layer in which
they are contained the less scattering there is and the less difference in
transmission between a diffuse and specular source.
   For the type of partially diffusing condenser mentioned above the
difference in contrast amounts to about one paper grade for ordinary
black-and-white negatives with silver images. For color materials, where
the image consists of very fine dye particals there is virtually no
scattering so the contrast is nearly independant of the type of source.
   For making large color prints a truely specular point-source type of
lamphouse is sometimes used. This results in sharper rendition of the image
at the cost of exagerating any blemish on the film. Such sources are very
rarely used for ordinary work.
   A diffusion source has the advantage of paritally suppressing blemishes.
However, this can sometimes be misleading. For B&W work, where there is a
difference in the image contrast between the two types a negative of given
contast must be printed on lower contrast paper on the condenser enlarger.
The lower paper contrast will tend to suppress negative blemishes. If a
negative with contrast matched to the condenser enlarger is used on a
diffusion enlarger a higher constast paper must be used which will tend to
pick up the blemishes. For color work the diffusion source will definitely
help to reduce the visibility of blemishes.
   The type of source is important if you are making densitometric
measurements. The densitometer source must match the printing source is the
measurements are to be meaningful.
   This is covered in any text on densitometry or sensitometry.

The publisher tells me September, but then he told me I would see press
proofs within 2 weeks 5 weeks ago. No sign yet. So I guess we'll just have
to be patient.

   If you are interested in Callier effect its covered in many texts on
optics.
   Most condenser enlargers are actually combination sources. The lamp is a
relatively large, highly diffuse, source, which is imaged approximately on
the entrance pupil of the enlarging lens. The difference between this and a
completely diffuse source like a typical dichroic color head amounts to a
moderate difference in image contrast.
   Callier effect is caused by the scattering of light from very small
particals. The smaller the particals and the thinner the layer in which
they are contained the less scattering there is and the less difference in
transmission between a diffuse and specular source.
   For the type of partially diffusing condenser mentioned above the
difference in contrast amounts to about one paper grade for ordinary
black-and-white negatives with silver images. For color materials, where
the image consists of very fine dye particals there is virtually no
scattering so the contrast is nearly independant of the type of source.
   For making large color prints a truely specular point-source type of
lamphouse is sometimes used. This results in sharper rendition of the image
at the cost of exagerating any blemish on the film. Such sources are very
rarely used for ordinary work.
   A diffusion source has the advantage of paritally suppressing blemishes.
However, this can sometimes be misleading. For B&W work, where there is a
difference in the image contrast between the two types a negative of given
contast must be printed on lower contrast paper on the condenser enlarger.
The lower paper contrast will tend to suppress negative blemishes. If a
negative with contrast matched to the condenser enlarger is used on a
diffusion enlarger a higher constast paper must be used which will tend to
pick up the blemishes. For color work the diffusion source will definitely
help to reduce the visibility of blemishes.
   The type of source is important if you are making densitometric
measurements. The densitometer source must match the printing source is the
measurements are to be meaningful.
   This is covered in any text on densitometry or sensitometry.

Garry,
Calm down man - you will do yourself a mischief!
Seriously, I forwarded your email to the publisher and asked him to respond.
Perhaps your heartfelt plea will penetrate where my more abrupt formal
requests for reliable information have failed!

(when wet - I don't have a dry print yet)
It won't give the multicolours in selenium that it's predecessor did - =

It also prints nicely as a reg. warmtone paper too, and tones well.

The old is now out of production so if you like it get some in the =

Barry

Here goes from a new member but one who has spoken to you many times on the
phone and uses your DiXactol for most of his 5 x 4 work.
There's nothing odd about using old equipment.
I use a Mk.6 MPP 5 x 4 field camera which must be nearly 50 years young. I
have stripped it of all 'extraneous' items such as focus finder, focus
cams,carry handle, focus scale etc., even the leather covering all to reduce
weight as I backpack with it in the Scottish Highlands as often as I can.
Fitted with modern optics the results are outstanding particularly when used
in conjunction with the zone system.
I also own a Hasselblad 500C body manufactured in the original year of
release onto the market -1948. It has seved me well since purchase
secondhand in the mid seventies and still works.I would be using it today if
I still had some optics to fit it.

Good luck with your search for M42 lenses-try some of the photographic
auctions listed on the MPP club site.

regards

JR

I'm curious about this comment - optics for the 500C are still readily
available, in the original 'C' formulations, the later T*, the still
later CF T*, and the now-current CFi T* families.  So far as I am
aware, the lens mount has never changed in the 500C/CM family
cameras, though the newer ones support TTL metering and the like.

Or, is it simply the case that you no longer own lenses which fit
your ancient (and venerable) 500C?

The original Hassy was a 1000F focal plane camera for which lenses do
exist, but only on the used market and good ones can be hard to find.

No.  A full stop is a doubling of exposure, which can be achieved either by
doubling the exposure time or the area of the lens aperture. But lens
aperture is described in terms of *diameter* and not area, so to double the
area you multiply the f/number by the square root of 2.  The most confusing
thing about f-stop printing (named originally by Gene Nocon) is the name,
because everyone thinks it's to do with lenses. It's not, it's just a means
of adjusting print density linearly; print density being a log function of
exposure time.  I did have an idea to suggest renaming it, using a new
"unit of photographic exposure".  In deference to the scientific
community's habit of naming measurement units after pioneering scientists
in that particular field, I thought that "Talbot" might be a nice name :-)
Then you could make adjustments to exposure of one Talbot for example ...

I'm not suggesting we do, although I hope that I can at least illustrate
why *I* was sold on the method as soon as I tried it :-)

You're a very experienced printer Barry and can no doubt estimate a
starting exposure very closely, but there are an awful lot of people out
there who can't, or who don't print frequently enough to gain the
experince. The test strip sequence I mentioned is often suggested in books
on printing for example.

> Here the
>differences would be much less variable, and are quite enough to see and
>judge. No programming is necessary of the timer.

Yes, I quite agree, but the beauty of the f-stop (Talbot?!) system is that
if some time you need to make a small or large print and end up with a
starting time of 5 secs or 50 secs, a quarter-stop interval is still the
same.  So you can directly compare a quarter-stop test strip centred on 5
secs with one at 50 secs.  No other system will allow you to do this. But I
quite appreciate that if *all* your exposures are made at around 15 secs
then the advantages are reduced.

>Variations in exposure, to say burn in or hold back portions of a print, are
>equally easy as percentages of total time.

Ah but it isn't *quite* like that you see :-)  If you start at 15 secs and
go up 10%, you get 16.5 secs.  If you now go down 10%, you get 16.5 - 1.65
i.e. 14.85 secs. A quarter stop up from 15 secs is 17.85 secs, and a
quarter stop down from 17.85 secs is 15 secs - you're back where you
started.  You have a means of increasing or reducing exposure in simple and
straightforward steps which are the same *no matter where you start*.

>To other thread readers, may I emphasise that this is not a criticism of
>Richard's timers. They are excellent. I use one myself, and it gives the

>shame on you. Buy one immediately!

I can't argue with that - thank you :-)  But why not try setting yours to
1/6th stop intervals, choosing 16 secs and use the test strip mode. You'll
get seven equally spaced exposures centred on your chosen time, and if the
one two steps lighter looks right, just press the "decrease time" key twice
and you're there.  And if you close the lens one stop and start at 32 secs,
you'll get *exactly the same result*!

My point really is this - there is a method of adjusting printing exposure
which is very convenient and accurate *but*, and it's a big but, if you
don't use a timer which is set up for it, it's frankly a pain because you
either have to resort to a calculator or a chart of figures to use it
properly.  So most people don't, and being a fundamentally lazy sort of
guy, I wouldn't do it that way myself either. But it's not difficult to
program a microprocessor to do the hard work for you and that's basically
what I did back in '94 - I could see that a bit of hard work over a short
period would make life easier afterwards. Now I can be lazy *and* use the
f-stop method :-)  I don't want to hijack this list to promote my products
nor do I suggest that the f-stop method is the best way, the only way, or
whatever. But if a tool is available to simplify life and improve results,
we may as well use it.

Truce? :-)

Cheers
Richard

    The term "Waterhouse stops" already has a well known meaning. They are 
fixed size stops in  sheets of metal which can be inserted in a slot in the 
lens barrel. This system predates the iris-diaphram type stop. It continued 
to be used in process lenses into the modern period because it allows, 
among other things, the use of special shapes of stops for half-tone work.
   Waterhouse was also an early investigator into dye sensitizing of 
emulsions and contributed in many other areas of photography.

Howbout " Waterloggedhouse Stops" since exposure is a log function?  Won't
mention a scale with reciprocity corrections built in.  What units? - metric
or  customary ;o)  Basic units such as candle fortnight per square perch?
Phil Davis will have to reprogram his computer.  Not to be taken too seriously.

Shouldn't any mail program be able to just list emails as they arrive? 
Surely this would keep messages in the order that they were sent...
I use hotmail, a very basic mail service, and have had no problem with

A few years ago I owned the 500th and something original Hasselblad
which was a 1600F replete with its fine Kodak Ektar lenses (which were
dropped in favor of the Zeiss because they cost too much!). Once they
decided the 1600th top speed was perhaps a little ambitious, it became
the 1000F. I had no real trouble finding lenses and backs for it. And in
testing, the Ektar beat the socks off the 1000F's original Tessar and
will hold its own with the Planar.

The last is a decided overstatement.  The Ektar is a fine lens and is
almost certainly superior to the Tessar at wider apertures -- it should be,
as it was specifically designed to be better than the Tessar.  But it
certainly is not superior in overall optical performance to the Planar,
with the caveat that these were all hand-assembled lenses, the Planar until
about 1970, and a good hand-assembled Ektar will almost certainly beat a
hand-assembled Planar made after one of those German three-beer lunches.

  For those of you into lith printing - and I know there are a few! - =
you may be interested in knowing about the new cadmium free replacement =
emulsion for Kentona. (Luminos Classic Warmtone and Classic Charcoal R =
in the US)
  As many of you know, the makers here in the UK have been under notice =
to remove the cadmium from this lovely paper.
  The good news is that the replacement lith prints beautifully. I have =
been testing it all afternoon and the lith prints are good - similar =
colour to Sterling, soft creamy cafe au lait h'lights, cold hard blacks. =
(when wet - I don't have a dry print yet)
  It won't give the multicolours in selenium that it's predecessor did - =
as expected.=20
  It also prints nicely as a reg. warmtone paper too, and tones well.

  The old is now out of production so if you like it get some in the =
freezer now :0)

To add to the emulsion?? I don't think so

BTW, next morning, it looks even better dry. Varies in colour according =
to exposure ans dev from fawn to a georgeous pale peach

    For those of you into lith printing - and I know there are a few! - =
you may be interested in knowing about the new cadmium free replacement =
emulsion for Kentona. (Luminos Classic Warmtone and Classic Charcoal R =
in the US)
    As many of you know, the makers here in the UK have been under =
notice to remove the cadmium from this lovely paper.
    The good news is that the replacement lith prints beautifully. I =
have been testing it all afternoon and the lith prints are good - =
similar colour to Sterling, soft creamy cafe au lait h'lights, cold hard =
blacks. (when wet - I don't have a dry print yet)
    It won't give the multicolours in selenium that it's predecessor did =
- as expected.=20
    It also prints nicely as a reg. warmtone paper too, and tones well.

    The old is now out of production so if you like it get some in the =
freezer now :0)

I am a confirmed f-stop printer - for all the reasons outined below by
Richard.
Gene Nocon who invented the first (AFAIK) f-stop printing timer in the 70's
(guess) used to try and persuade me to change from the usual linear method
to f-stop timing. I always refused because I had been doing it my way for
years and was comfortable with it. Some years later I was equipping a new
darkroom and decided to make the switch - and guess what - it was actually
easy , more logical, quicker, more accurate switching between print sizes,
and as they say... so much more... I couldn't understand why I hadn't done
it years before.
I can't imagine working without my f-stop timer now!
Give it some serious thought, you won't regret it and at least with Richards
superior versions you have the safety net of having linear timing as well
should you want it.

There's nothing odd about using old equipment.
I use a Mk.6 MPP 5 x 4 field camera which must be nearly 50 years young. I
have stripped it of all 'extraneous' items such as focus finder, focus
cams,carry handle, focus scale etc., even the leather covering all to reduce
weight as I backpack with it in the Scottish Highlands as often as I can.
Fitted with modern optics the results are outstanding particularly when used
in conjunction with the zone system.
I also own a Hasselblad 500C body manufactured in the original year of
release onto the market -1948. It has seved me well since purchase
secondhand in the mid seventies and still works.I would be using it today if
I still had some optics to fit it.

Good luck with your search for M42 lenses-try some of the photographic
auctions listed on the MPP club site.

Hi John
Good to hear from you. Your message is very reassuring. I am not a weirdo
after all. But just a minute. The horrible truth has just dawned - maybe we
are both weirdos!
Seriously, did you see the article in Amateur Photographer this week about
MPP by Ivor Matanle? You know I already use an MPP Microflex. The article
did get me interested in the 5x4 MPP technical camera, but it did look
pretty big and heavy for landscape work compared to wooden field cameras
like the Wista.

No.  A full stop is a doubling of exposure, which can be achieved either by
doubling the exposure time or the area of the lens aperture. But lens
aperture is described in terms of *diameter* and not area, so to double the
area you multiply the f/number by the square root of 2.  The most confusing
thing about f-stop printing (named originally by Gene Nocon) is the name,
because everyone thinks it's to do with lenses. It's not, it's just a means
of adjusting print density linearly; print density being a log function of
exposure time.  I did have an idea to suggest renaming it, using a new
"unit of photographic exposure".  In deference to the scientific
community's habit of naming measurement units after pioneering scientists
in that particular field, I thought that "Talbot" might be a nice name :-)
Then you could make adjustments to exposure of one Talbot for example ...

Yes, I know that, but aren't the stops you show in the series above full
stops? Doesn't, for instance, f8 yield twice as much exposure as f11?

I'm not suggesting we do, although I hope that I can at least illustrate
why *I* was sold on the method as soon as I tried it :-)

You're a very experienced printer Barry and can no doubt estimate a
starting exposure very closely, but there are an awful lot of people out
there who can't, or who don't print frequently enough to gain the
experince. The test strip sequence I mentioned is often suggested in books
on printing for example.

I honestly haven't come across people in coaching individuals or when
running workshops who would use such extreme steps in a test strip. Even so,
too much is made of the desirability of even density steps. Even if you get
down to 1/6 stop spacing (and the fact that you need to could be said to
reflect the unnecessary complexity of f stop print exposure), you can bet
that the required exposure is still going to fall between two steps. For all
normal work I leave my timer set to 2 second steps and give multiple
'bursts' of that time for test strips. Obviously if the print is on a known
slow paper or is particularly big, the basic step might go up to, say, 4
seconds, but we wouldn't start with a single 4 second exposure. The first
step might well be, say, 5 x 4 seconds = 20 seconds.


> Here the
>differences would be much less variable, and are quite enough to see and
>judge. No programming is necessary of the timer.

Yes, I quite agree, but the beauty of the f-stop (Talbot?!) system is that
if some time you need to make a small or large print and end up with a
starting time of 5 secs or 50 secs, a quarter-stop interval is still the
same.  So you can directly compare a quarter-stop test strip centred on 5
secs with one at 50 secs.  No other system will allow you to do this. But I
quite appreciate that if *all* your exposures are made at around 15 secs
then the advantages are reduced.

Percentages work like this too and are easier to work out

>Variations in exposure, to say burn in or hold back portions of a print,
are
>equally easy as percentages of total time.

Ah but it isn't *quite* like that you see :-)  If you start at 15 secs and
go up 10%, you get 16.5 secs.  If you now go down 10%, you get 16.5 - 1.65
i.e. 14.85 secs. A quarter stop up from 15 secs is 17.85 secs, and a
quarter stop down from 17.85 secs is 15 secs - you're back where you
started.  You have a means of increasing or reducing exposure in simple and
straightforward steps which are the same *no matter where you start*.

But why would I want to increase and decrease exposure like this? All I want
to do is work out a proportionate increase or decrease on a basic exposure
time for dodging and burning. A percentage increase of say, 20%, to burn in
a sky seems to me to yield identical results with a base exposure time of
say 15 seconds, as with a base exposure time for a larger print of the same
negative of 30 seconds.

>shame on you. Buy one immediately!

I can't argue with that - thank you :-)  But why not try setting yours to
1/6th stop intervals, choosing 16 secs and use the test strip mode. You'll
get seven equally spaced exposures centred on your chosen time, and if the
one two steps lighter looks right, just press the "decrease time" key twice
and you're there.  And if you close the lens one stop and start at 32 secs,
you'll get *exactly the same result*!

Well, for a number of reasons. One is that it is fiddly compared to my
normal method. A second is that I may well want more than seven steps in the
strip. A third is critical. When the correct exposure time for the print is
found by whatever method, f stop or linear, to translate this series of
intermittent exposures into one longer time for final print exposure does
give an erroneous result. The single total exposure time effectively gives
significantly greater exposure than multiple 'bursts' of exposure of the
shorter times used for the test strip steps. The difference varies from
paper to paper as well. To the best of my knowledge, and you may be able to
correct me on this, f stop timers do not permit exposure of the whole print
by this multiple burst method. In fact I use the 'burst' method as my
dodging and burning control. So, if for instance, the total exposure should
be nine x 2 seconds according to my test strip, I do not expose for 18
seconds, which would yield noticeably more density in the key highlights, I
expose for nine 'bursts' of 2 seconds. I might hold one part of the picture
back for three bursts and another for four. Burning in can be for an extra
five bursts in one area, or maybe two in another. This way, if I have more
than one print to do, or if I am working up to the ultimate fine print, I
can repeat the operation precisely without problem, and without being
pressured by the clock running continually. I can pause for a moment between
'bursts' to gather myself before proceeding.

My point really is this - there is a method of adjusting printing exposure
which is very convenient and accurate
 ( but is it Richard? I certainly don't see why it is more 'accurate', and I
don't find it more convenient in practice)
*but*, and it's a big but, if you
don't use a timer which is set up for it, it's frankly a pain because you
either have to resort to a calculator or a chart of figures to use it
properly.  So most people don't, and being a fundamentally lazy sort of
guy, I wouldn't do it that way myself either. But it's not difficult to
program a microprocessor to do the hard work for you and that's basically
what I did back in '94 - I could see that a bit of hard work over a short
period would make life easier afterwards. Now I can be lazy *and* use the
f-stop method :-)  I don't want to hijack this list to promote my products
nor do I suggest that the f-stop method is the best way, the only way, or
whatever. But if a tool is available to simplify life and improve results,
we may as well use it.

Truce? :-)

Cheers
Richard

No need for a truce Richard. Sounds like another "heated agreement" to me.
The differences in this issue are just about the same as those in the split
grading versus single filtration approach in VC printing. Both work. You
choose the one that works better for you. Unlike many proponents of split
grade printing, you don't make overblown claims for the superiority of your
preferred method, and your instruments allow a free choice of either method,
so there is no problem.
Incidentally, during recent torrid hot weather when suffering in the heat in
my darkroom to get rush orders away, my Hauck digital timer packed in (a
thermal cut out I guess - it resumed later in cooler weather), while your
model continued to work like a charm. Must be sweat proof!

Barry

I am a confirmed f-stop printer - for all the reasons outined below by
Richard.
Gene Nocon who invented the first (AFAIK) f-stop printing timer in the 70's
(guess) used to try and persuade me to change from the usual linear method
to f-stop timing. I always refused because I had been doing it my way for
years and was comfortable with it. Some years later I was equipping a new
darkroom and decided to make the switch - and guess what - it was actually
easy , more logical, quicker, more accurate switching between print sizes,
and as they say... so much more... I couldn't understand why I hadn't done
it years before.
I can't imagine working without my f-stop timer now!
Give it some serious thought, you won't regret it and at least with Richards
superior versions you have the safety net of having linear timing as well
should you want it.
I have tried it thoroughly Tim. I am an inveterate fiddler trying anything
new and getting bored with old ways. However, I do not find it superior for
the reasons I have set out in my further reply to Richard. But as I said to
him, if it works for you, use it. It is fruitless to argue over this.
I do question the whole logic of the approach however, which says 'because
we use f stops for cameras it is logical to use it for printing'. Why? There
is a big difference. When we adjust camera f stops, the light reflected from
the scene may well be double or half from various parts of the scene, but
when those are recorded on to film and developed, the resulting negative
densities are nothing like double or half. This linear relationship is lost.
Additionally, print exposure variations have nothing like the range in
brightness encountered in camera exposures, and we find ourselves having to
work with, say, 1/6 f stops, and even then the 'right' exposure still falls
between two steps, just as with linear timing.
The key factor swinging me away from f stop timing and back to linear was
the issue of translating multiple exposure steps as in the test strip, to
one total time for the print, which gives significantly incorrect exposure.
With fibre printing, this is often just put down to the dry-down effect. It
isn't. It's an additional factor leading to muddy highlights. One long
exposure also gives difficulty in repeatable controllable dodging in
practice and puts unnecessary pressure on the printer to achieve this while
the clock is running - see my comments in the reply to Richard.
BUT, this is very much a matter of personal choice. If it works for you, use
it. We are agreed on the value of Richards dual method timers.

Cordially, Barry

Tim
Do some of the papers from other countries, Asia and eastern Europe for
example, still contain cadmium to the best of your knowledge? I used
Sterling and more recently Fort Museum for instance, and wonder if any of
their excellent characteristic qualities derive from the presence of
cadmium. I understand that it used to be present in Agfa Record many years
ago when that was the acknowledged 'king of papers' for fine printers in
Europe.
What is its purpose in a paper I wonder? I am uneasy about my environmental
responsibilities if it is in some of the papers I use - I don't know how
nasty a substance it might be within the manufacturing country.
Any thoughts?

Barry Thornton

To add to the emulsion?? I don't think so

BTW, next morning, it looks even better dry. Varies in colour according to
exposure ans dev from fawn to a georgeous pale peach

    For those of you into lith printing - and I know there are a few! - you
may be interested in knowing about the new cadmium free replacement emulsion
for Kentona. (Luminos Classic Warmtone and Classic Charcoal R in the US)
    As many of you know, the makers here in the UK have been under notice to
remove the cadmium from this lovely paper.
    The good news is that the replacement lith prints beautifully. I have
been testing it all afternoon and the lith prints are good - similar colour
to Sterling, soft creamy cafe au lait h'lights, cold hard blacks. (when
wet - I don't have a dry print yet)
    It won't give the multicolours in selenium that it's predecessor did -
as expected.
    It also prints nicely as a reg. warmtone paper too, and tones well.

    The old is now out of production so if you like it get some in the
freezer now :0)

If you want it to wash up over here you might want to learn about the proper

have been appalled by the spelling you Brits have sunk toward but I think
that Barry might be excused due to the July,4th birthdate if he can just get
'color" right on his spell checker. At least you guys haven't sunk all the
way to the complete metric system and might still be able to understand the
finer points of measurement.  :o)

We in the UK have the best of both worlds - we try to use 'real'
measurements and the metric system simultaneously. But I think we might go
for the metric system properly if you Yanks would just adopt it to and
'correct' its spelling. I could easily see myself using leeters and
sentymeters. Might make a mess of some of your older popular songs of
course. " Mammy. Mammy. I'd walk a million, six hundred thousand and twelve
keelometers for one of your smiles - my ma-a-a-mmy". Loses some of its style
don't you think?

It's hard to know but I believe some Indian and Croatian papers do use =
it and probably some asian papers too judging by the way they print and =
tone. Most are fairly cagey about their emulsion contents though and =
often - as was the case with Sterling Lith - deny emulsion changes when =
they are self evident in the papers properties. Exactly what the cadmium =
does in the chemisty at a molecular level I don't know (but would like =
to if anyone on the list can help) but it's effect in printing and =
particularly with selenium toning is well known - the famous Record =
rapid split and the spectacular cadmium containing Kentona/Art =
Classic/Tapestry multi colour response to Se when lithed are typical =
examples. Sadly there doesn't seem to be an alternative that does the =
same thing (outside of Photoshop of course ;-)  oops sorry !! )

  Do some of the papers from other countries, Asia and eastern Europe =
for example, still contain cadmium to the best of your knowledge? I used =
Sterling and more recently Fort=E9 Museum for instance, and wonder if =
any of their excellent characteristic qualities derive from the presence =
of cadmium. I understand that it used to be present in Agfa Record many =
years ago when that was the acknowledged 'king of papers' for fine =
printers in Europe.
  What is its purpose in a paper I wonder? I am uneasy about my =
environmental responsibilities if it is in some of the papers I use - I =
don't know how nasty a substance it might be within the manufacturing =
country.
  Any thoughts?

      For those of you into lith printing - and I know there are a few! =
- you may be interested in knowing about the new cadmium free =
replacement emulsion for Kentona. (Luminos Classic Warmtone and Classic =
Charcoal R in the US)
      As many of you know, the makers here in the UK have been under =
notice to remove the cadmium from this lovely paper.
      The good news is that the replacement lith prints beautifully. I =
have been testing it all afternoon and the lith prints are good - =
similar colour to Sterling, soft creamy cafe au lait h'lights, cold hard =
blacks. (when wet - I don't have a dry print yet)
      It won't give the multicolours in selenium that it's predecessor =
did - as expected.=20
      It also prints nicely as a reg. warmtone paper too, and tones =
well.

      The old is now out of production so if you like it get some in the =
freezer now :0)

Oh I wouldn't argue about it Barry, and I wasn't saying 'f-stop printing is
the only true path' or anything like that. I believe that there are often
different routes to the holy grail and that dogmatic banner waving sometimes
shows a narrow mind. What I said was that I am a confirmed f-stop printer -
which I am. It works for me and now I wouldn't return to using a linear
timer for anything. The joy of being able to change from a 10 x 8 to a 12 x
16 and a 16 x 20 for a complex print without having to change anything
except the initial exposure and get consistent and repeatable results is
great. I look a print and automatically see it in f-stops and know that to
darken this or that bit needs so & so fraction of an f-stop, regardless of
the size of the print and regardless of the initial exposure - makes life
easy.
Do what ever works for you. It's the end product that counts.
Tim

Yes, but the sequence above was of time, not lens apertures; 11 seconds
does *not* yield twice as much as 8 seconds.  This is exactly what I was
getting at when I suggested that "f-stop printing" is a confusing name!

>Percentages work like this too and are easier to work out

Yes, a quarter stop can be expressed as a percentage (12%) and you're quite
right about that. But as I explained in my last message, 10% up and 10%
down are not the same. A quarter-stop up is +12%, a quarter-stop down is
-16% approximately.

Absolutely true! But with an f-stop test strip covering a wide range you
can actually determine both the basic exposure and some if not all of the
burning in from the single test, without doing any calculations (provided
you have an f-stop timer!).

Then your enlarger is exhibiting a significant "soft start" or bulb warm-up
time.  Do you use a stabilised transformer?  Some, such as Durst and Kaiser
models, have a half-second or so delay between applying power and the bulb
coming on, and this would produce the effect you're noticing.  All our
timers have optional compensation for this.  At least one reviewer of our
original StopClock tried the multiple vs single exposure test and got an
identical result from both.

We provide "burn-in" modes so that the clock is *not* running continuously.
The StopClock Professional allows you up to 20 programmable burn-ins which
you can simply sequence through as often as you like - if you need to make
several copies of a print for example.  On the LE version, you simply
increase the exposure time by, say half a stop, then press and hold the
footswitch - the timer works out the difference for you and times it as a
burn-in exposure.  You can do that as often as you want till you make the
next full exposure.
>
>No need for a truce Richard. Sounds like another "heated agreement" to me.

*smile* Yes, I'm not trying to convert you, just to explain to readers
perhaps unfamiliar with the technique just what it's about. At the end of
the day, in practical use in the darkroom, the fact that our timers use the
f-stop method is more or less invisible to the user who simply chooses to
increase or decrease his exposure times in steps which are not simply
seconds, but steps of print density. And that seems to me to be logical
because it's print density that we're ultimately interested in.

Enough sweat went into the design .... ;-)

Because your enlarger isn't giving you the exposure time you think it is -
see above. 

>One long
>exposure also gives difficulty in repeatable controllable dodging in
>practice and puts unnecessary pressure on the printer to achieve this while
>the clock is running 

Which is why f-stop timers (including the original Nocon model) have
burn-in memories.  Once you've made the basic exposure you tell the timer
you want another half stop in the sky or whatever, and it does it. In the
case of the StopClock Pro., you tell it in advance, while the lights are on
and you're looking at your work print or test strip, so the pressure on you
to remember things while the paper's on the easel is significantly
*reduced* ...

Richard

Richard:

- I will now start calling 'your' system Talbot -unit printing; f-stop
printing is really a confusing misnomer with the f-stops mostly remaining
unchanged while the times are changed

- (with regard to the comment on top,) will the next version of the
Analyser have a facility that adjusts exposure time for changes in
enlargment factor?

- seriously, what I think is really needed is a facility for timing
burning-ins in Talbot steps. It would be a great thing if there was a
burning-in  timing facility  with a button that one pressed the number of
times corresponding to the number of 1/12th Talbot steps one wishes the
burning in time to run for.  Different areas could get different number of
steps. Then one would not have to think of how 5 seconds burn-in time
relates to the standard exposure time or the enlargment factor etc etc..
(Please say this is already a feature, I just need to read the manual more
carefully!)

- when I started with the Analyser, I kept a series of 'calibration' prints
from the same negative (same enlargement factor) pasted to the wall. One
perfect print (as I considered it) and three underexposures (each by one
Talbot printing step), and three overexposures: When printing other
negatives I then compared the test print to the calibration prints I had on
the wall, and it was easy to see how many times I would need to press the
lighter or darker button to get a good print. (I also had series of prints
to show the effect of changes in paper grades.) Series of test stips are no
good for me, they do not show where dodging and burn-in have to be made.
Full prints do

- How much is the upgrade of the Analyser, and can I do it myself by
replacing a new chip or do I have to ship the whole thing back to you for
the work to be done by you?

Tim,
    Cadmium salts are used to slow the physical maturation of the emulsion.
They also bring a better homogeneity and a higher spectral sensitivity due
to cadmium ions penetration in the emulsion network. Cadmium salts give als=
o
a better contrast in chloride papers. This is also the case with bromide
papers but with a decrease of the " internal image "
    I found this in a 1976 very good French book (written in French and
very difficult to find ) : Chemistry and  Physic in Photography - Pierre
Glafkides

It's hard to know but I believe some Indian and Croatian papers do use it
and probably some asian papers too judging by the way they print and tone.
Most are fairly cagey about their emulsion contents though and often - as
was the case with Sterling Lith - deny emulsion changes when they are self
evident in the papers properties. Exactly what the cadmium does in the
chemisty at a molecular level I don't know (but would like to if anyone on
the list can help) but it's effect in printing and particularly with
selenium toning is well known - the famous Record rapid split and the
spectacular cadmium containing Kentona/Art Classic/Tapestry multi colour
response to Se when lithed are typical examples. Sadly there doesn't seem t=
o
be an alternative that does the same thing (outside of Photoshop of course
;-)  oops sorry !! )

Tim
Do some of the papers from other countries, Asia and eastern Europe for
example, still contain cadmium to the best of your knowledge? I used
Sterling and more recently Fort=E9 Museum for instance, and wonder if any of
their excellent characteristic qualities derive from the presence of
cadmium. I understand that it used to be present in Agfa Record many years
ago when that was the acknowledged 'king of papers' for fine printers in
Europe.
What is its purpose in a paper I wonder? I am uneasy about my environmental
responsibilities if it is in some of the papers I use - I don't know how
nasty a substance it might be within the manufacturing country.
Any thoughts?

To add to the emulsion?? I don't think so

BTW, next morning, it looks even better dry. Varies in colour according to
exposure ans dev from fawn to a georgeous pale peach

For those of you into lith printing - and I know there are a few! - you may
be interested in knowing about the new cadmium free replacement emulsion fo=
r
Kentona. (Luminos Classic Warmtone and Classic Charcoal R in the US)
As many of you know, the makers here in the UK have been under notice to
remove the cadmium from this lovely paper.
The good news is that the replacement lith prints beautifully. I have been
testing it all afternoon and the lith prints are good - similar colour to
Sterling, soft creamy cafe au lait h'lights, cold hard blacks. (when wet - =
I
don't have a dry print yet)
It won't give the multicolours in selenium that it's predecessor did - as
expected.
It also prints nicely as a reg. warmtone paper too, and tones well.

The old is now out of production so if you like it get some in the freezer
now :0)

  Tim,
      Cadmium salts are used to slow the physical maturation of the =
emulsion. They also bring a better homogeneity and a higher spectral =
sensitivity due to cadmium ions penetration in the emulsion network. =
Cadmium salts give also a better contrast in chloride papers. This is =
also the case with bromide papers but with a decrease of the " internal =
image "
      I found this in a 1976 very good French book (written in French =
and  very difficult to find ) : Chemistry and  Physic in Photography - =

    It's hard to know but I believe some Indian and Croatian papers do =
use it and probably some asian papers too judging by the way they print =
and tone. Most are fairly cagey about their emulsion contents though and =
often - as was the case with Sterling Lith - deny emulsion changes when =
they are self evident in the papers properties. Exactly what the cadmium =
does in the chemisty at a molecular level I don't know (but would like =
to if anyone on the list can help) but it's effect in printing and =
particularly with selenium toning is well known - the famous Record =
rapid split and the spectacular cadmium containing Kentona/Art =
Classic/Tapestry multi colour response to Se when lithed are typical =
examples. Sadly there doesn't seem to be an alternative that does the =
same thing (outside of Photoshop of course ;-)  oops sorry !! )

      Do some of the papers from other countries, Asia and eastern =
Europe for example, still contain cadmium to the best of your knowledge? =
I used Sterling and more recently Fort=E9 Museum for instance, and =
wonder if any of their excellent characteristic qualities derive from =
the presence of cadmium. I understand that it used to be present in Agfa =
Record many years ago when that was the acknowledged 'king of papers' =
for fine printers in Europe.
      What is its purpose in a paper I wonder? I am uneasy about my =
environmental responsibilities if it is in some of the papers I use - I =
don't know how nasty a substance it might be within the manufacturing =
country.
      Any thoughts?

          For those of you into lith printing - and I know there are a =
few! - you may be interested in knowing about the new cadmium free =
replacement emulsion for Kentona. (Luminos Classic Warmtone and Classic =
Charcoal R in the US)
          As many of you know, the makers here in the UK have been under =
notice to remove the cadmium from this lovely paper.
          The good news is that the replacement lith prints beautifully. =
I have been testing it all afternoon and the lith prints are good - =
similar colour to Sterling, soft creamy cafe au lait h'lights, cold hard =
blacks. (when wet - I don't have a dry print yet)
          It won't give the multicolours in selenium that it's =
predecessor did - as expected.=20
          It also prints nicely as a reg. warmtone paper too, and tones =
well.
          =20
          The old is now out of production so if you like it get some in =

On lith printing of East European stock: 

I tried a few: Tsjech Foma paper worked , nice, but subdued, not as
spectaculair as Kentona, and this was on old stock. I hope to obtain
some fresh paper soon to test it. There is also a small firm in Berlin
who stocks home labeled (re-labeled easteren european stock) called
Vario Classic and Classic Arts, which modestly Lith print. The firm is
called Fotoimpex (www.fotoimpex.de). I suppose there is a certain risk
in using these papers, the batch to batch differences are unkown

   Very interesting indeed.
    This is more than is discussed by Mees and others. Mees and James also 
suggest that Cadmium may help to preserve the emulsion from changes with 
time. Evidently newer papers without Cadmium do have a much shorter shelf 
life than those with it.
    Glafkides book is cited frequently in the literature but you are the 
first person who actually has a copy. I think there must have been an 
earlier book by this author or someone with the same name.
    There are relatively few books which discuss the actual process of 
emulsion making as opposed to simply its principles. This is considered 
very secret stuff by the film and paper makers. I think there are few books 
published by Focal Press which cover it.
   I wonder if "internal image" means latent image of is something else.

And not change the contrast either...

But the _real_ reason for the hiding of blemishes with diffused light
sources has more to do with where those blemishes are...

with a point source of light... (and you may want to ensure you're using
a fixed with font at this point)


                     * light source
                     |
                     |
                     |
                     |  light ray
                     |
                    xxx    blemish
  -------------------|----------------- top of film
                     |
                     |
  ___________________|__________________ emulsion (silver)
  ------------------/|\----------------- bottom of film
                   / | \
                  /  |  \  cone of diffused light
                    ___
                   <___>  lens

Now it is commonly and easily understood that the aperture lens (which
is placed at the conjugate of the condenser (not shown) has little
effect on exposure, but an effect on contrast.

However, it is also clear that and blemish, scratch, or dust on the
upper side of the film will show up clearly on the image.  The same is
true (but actually to a slightly lesser extent) for such defects on the
lower (emulsion) side of the neg as that is so much closer to the
emulsion

For a diffuse source, the effect is different

     ******************************* light source
           \         |         /
            \        |        /
             \       |       /
              \      |      /       cone of light rays
               \     |     /
                \   xxx   /        blemish
  ---------------\---|---/------------- top of film
                  \  |  /
                   \ | /
  __________________\|/__________________ emulsion (silver)
  ------------------/|\----------------- bottom of film
                   / | \
                  /  |  \  cone of diffused light
                    ___
                   <___>  lens


It is quite obvious that a blemish on the top surface of the film will
not mask all of the light passing through a particular point in the
emulsion.  Thus the blemish will reduce the intensity of light reaching
the paper LESS and the difference in exposure between the area under the
blemish and the unblemished area will be less.  And assuming that both
negs have been developed to the approprriate CI, this will result in a
less obvious blemish on the print made with a diffusion enlarger.

Clearly the typical condenser enlarger fits somewhere between these two
extremes.

However it should be noted that shadow detail is potentially rendered
differently on a diffusion enlarger than on an enlarger with more
specular light sources (where the Q of the film is significantly greater
than 1)

This is only true for films containing residual silver.  It is not true
of chromogenic films.  In the case of chromogenic films there is no
scattering, and thus the callier effect disappears.

I recently started printing again, using F-stop printing.  AT fist I thought
it was a lot of mumbo jumbo nonsense.  However I quickly realized that I
THINK in terms of zones ..... this needs a change of 1/3 tzone, that
requires 1/6 of a zone, etc.  It kinda snuck up on me as really the way I
work anyway.  My old methods of a little bit more or a little bit less, were
difficult to follow.  The F-stop printing method is not so much as
revolutionary, as applied photography.

Remember it is only a sequence of timing changes, not a big major change in
the way one actually works.  Keep the timning sequence close at hand.....
the changes are always relevant to the present time.

Now on to split grade printing and masking!

Hi dear fellow list member !
At first, I will thank all of you for the huge amount of pertinent
information I'm able to gather from mailing list like this one.
But, if I'm definitely not a good printer, I'm good at computer, as it
is my job.
So this post serve only one purpose : help to explain and clarify some
facts about mail and Usenet.
As traditional postal services mail require to know the address of the
recipient for the mail to reach them.
But postal services never care for the language the letter is written,
as long as the address can be read by the human beings in duty to
transmit mail.
Of course, the recipients must be able to understand the content of the
mail.....
Electronic mail suffer for the very same limitations, plus the fact that
some mail can be, and actually are, harmful, being charged with
viruses... This is why a lot of people ask for not sending HTML email
and not attaching binaries to them. Html, binaries, even Microsoft word
document may transmit the computer disease called viruses. Html mail is
unreadable for most of internet people not using Microsoft's mailers !!!
It is also a shame because it takes so mutch size to say only "hello all
!" compared to plain text.
Next, our beloved Tim Danieluk runs a mailing list server. This is not
regular plain email ! It is somewhat distorted. the job consists when it
receive a mail from one of the subscriber, to fac-simile it in as so
many copies as list members, and to send everybody a copy having edited
one to change the reply to address (more on this later). This explain
why we had a storm of "vacation" information some weeks ago ;-) (things
like that happens when a computer talk to another one.... They are not
so cute than dreamed by  Mr Gates and al.)
The other distortion is Usenet newsgroups (here there is only the reader
in common, a lot of the system is vastly different from the email
system)

To make it short, there are some things to remember to keep one's
computer safe and to be able to reach every people you wanted to :
1) Never ever use possibly infected mail : no dot exe files, no Word
Docs (use RTF format instead) no excel sheets (save them as plain text
and if the formulas for calculations are important, send them in a
separate lain text email. This is a lot of work, but could be the sole
solution if your computer is infected with pernicious viruses).
2) avoid Microsoft's Outlook as a mail reader, it is difficult to be
sure dot exe files or Visual basic files won't be run before being
opened... Treat with great suspicion mails in HTML, with strange files
attached, or with doc or excel sheets attached particularly if they
originate from people _you trust or know_; this is not paranoia, it
could have been beaten with a I LOVE YOU like virus....
3) if possible move your operating system to one not so widespread as
Windows. As this one represents about 95% of the market, it is a perfect
target to virus makers (who cares for the 5% left ?) Of course this is
not particularly easy, but keep an eye to unix like systems (Linux and
FreeBSD are perfect candidates...)
4) Never use the mail reader packed for free with your system. Make an
effort worth the price : buy one  (Netscape, come first to mind but they
are so many) and learn to use it and configure it properly. You won't be
beaten by 95% of the viruses....
5) never ever respond to SPAM mail saying "to unsubscribe send email at
...." they use it to gather your real email address they do not know
(having used some sort of fraud like to reach you) And they put it in a
database, selling them to make money or to SPAM you in the future! In
particular, the western web announcement we saw some days ago is a
perfect example. The remove messages never go to western web but
painfully flood our mailboxes .... Because the ROBOt at tim's machine
edited the original message to put a "reply to pure-silver" filed not
present on the original... Those people count on the fact that you're
polite and well educated people and that you think that every individual
in this world is like you.... Generally speaking ignore unsolicited
email, if the offer is so interesting, you will soon see ads in
newspapers, and so !
6) beware not to use your business mail address for your hobby, it has
sometimes side effects. If you appears to be responsible for a company
virus attack from a "private" email, or if the mail server stop working
because the spam it gets is hundred times bigger than the load is was
planned for.... These smart machines keep logs, and in case of failure
or attack they use it to trace the problem to the originator. And "take
appropriate actions" as they call it @)
Some of you will find this quite basic explanation. But If I'm sure that
photographic stuff will be understood perfectly by all of you, I'm not
so sure for computer techno babble.... So please take this for what it
is : a kind help for some of you better with an enlarger than with a
mouse, having to share the expensive computer they own with their work
and hobby. As so it is important to keep it as safe as possible. If some
of you need further explanation, feel free to contact me directly (I
will be on holiday next week taking pictures !) and remember, do a cut
and paste of my address and do not reply to the pure silver mailing list
unless you want the discussion become public.
Cheers and continue flooding my mailbox of so high value photographic
information !

    Glafkides book was published for the first time in the 1960's and was 
reprinted 4th times. I have the last and updated reprint. If you need any
information that can be found in the book I will send you a scan copy of the
pages ( in French ) or make some translation.
    Cadmium salts could have been replaced by other compounds to stabilise
the emulsion.

Guys, I seem to be suffering from a serious case of brain fog, just don't
see.
Richard are you saying, that if I have my enlarger lens wide open, that you
base your exposure times to that of f-stops on a lens.   Keeping the
exposure time linear to the f-stop of the lens.

BTW,  I have REALLY enjoyed the last several subject lines, learned quite a
bit in the last week.  I have a couple of enlargers just haven't started
printing yet.  The only serious time I have available is when the wife/kids
go out of town, which they are over due. :')  Any way to maximize my
darkroom time, is appreciated.

John

Tim

You are right. I simply no longer own any 'blad lenses having sold virtually
all my 'blad items some years ago.
However I am keeping a leisurely eye open for a chrome 80 or 100mm lens
which will give me a complete camera as I still have an original design 12on
back.
I always thought the chrome lenses were suppior to the later T stars which I
found too contrasty, at least for wedding photography which was my main use
for the 'blad gear.

The keeping properties of cadmium papers are now useful as this discontinued
paper has an estimated shelf life of 2 - 3 years and up to 8 or 10 if
frozen. I've certainly filled a freezer with it!
The contrast issue is probably what makes the chloride predominant emulsions
printable with most negs - although this is not too much of a problem with
lith printing as the contrast is controlled by the processing.
Whether it is the cadmium itself, or the fact that its inclusion allows a
more Cl rich emulsion to be used with a workable contrast, which gives the
printing and toning properties typical of these papers I am not sure. It is
usually attributed to the cadmium but it might not be the obvious answer.

I would appreciate input from all readers regarding their experience with 
different RC papers. I have used AGFA MCP (glossy) for a year or so with 
acceptable results, most of the time as "first prints" before printing on 
conventional paper. I find the MCP OK as regards to Dmax and general 
appearance but never as pleasant to look at as a conventional paper. 

I certainly like the simple procedure of washing, quite often selenium 
toning, drying and a flat copy!
But, the "look" could be better and I could often use a warmer (or at least 
less cold) paper.

What is your experience with other RC papers today: Kodak, Ilford, Forte 
(=Bergger??), Kentmere etc? Different surfaces, different looks? Dmax, toning 
etc?

Members

Thought I would add my pennneth re. printing.

I gave up using any form of electronic timing some years ago in favour =
of------a metronome.
Yes really.
I simply hold a card under the enlarger lens, switch on the =
enlarger,remove the card and count beats (a setting of 72/minute suits =
me) then place the card back in the light path and switch off the =
enlarger light.
Worked for people like Weston and Adams so who am I to quibble.
The beauty is that one does not have to remove ones eyes from the print =
for dodging and burning to reset the timer.
Also as a reasonably successful zone system worker most of my negatives =
fall close to the same number of beats for standard print sizes.
The number of beats for a given print size from a particular negative =
type (for me developed in DiXactol or HC110) are recorded on a chart on =
the darkroom wall.
This gives me lens focal length,enlarger height and filtration,print =
size and number of beats.
What could be simpler or cheaper for that matter?

regards

JR

And not change the contrast either...

But the _real_ reason for the hiding of blemishes with diffused light
sources has more to do with where those blemishes are...

with a point source of light... (and you may want to ensure you're using
a fixed with font at this point)


                     * light source
                     |
                     |
                     |
                     |  light ray
                     |
                    xxx    blemish
  -------------------|----------------- top of film
                     |
                     |
  ___________________|__________________ emulsion (silver)
  ------------------/|\----------------- bottom of film
                   / | \
                  /  |  \  cone of diffused light
                    ___
                   <___>  lens

Now it is commonly and easily understood that the aperture lens (which
is placed at the conjugate of the condenser (not shown) has little
effect on exposure, but an effect on contrast.

However, it is also clear that and blemish, scratch, or dust on the
upper side of the film will show up clearly on the image.  The same is
true (but actually to a slightly lesser extent) for such defects on the
lower (emulsion) side of the neg as that is so much closer to the
emulsion

For a diffuse source, the effect is different

     ******************************* light source
           \         |         /
            \        |        /
             \       |       /
              \      |      /       cone of light rays
               \     |     /
                \   xxx   /        blemish
  ---------------\---|---/------------- top of film
                  \  |  /
                   \ | /
  __________________\|/__________________ emulsion (silver)
  ------------------/|\----------------- bottom of film
                   / | \
                  /  |  \  cone of diffused light
                    ___
                   <___>  lens


It is quite obvious that a blemish on the top surface of the film will
not mask all of the light passing through a particular point in the
emulsion.  Thus the blemish will reduce the intensity of light reaching
the paper LESS and the difference in exposure between the area under the
blemish and the unblemished area will be less.  And assuming that both
negs have been developed to the approprriate CI, this will result in a
less obvious blemish on the print made with a diffusion enlarger.

Clearly the typical condenser enlarger fits somewhere between these two
extremes.

However it should be noted that shadow detail is potentially rendered
differently on a diffusion enlarger than on an enlarger with more
specular light sources (where the Q of the film is significantly greater
than 1)

This is only true for films containing residual silver.  It is not true
of chromogenic films.  In the case of chromogenic films there is no
scattering, and thus the callier effect disappears.

Hi Richard
I started to reply to you last message point-by-point, but found that I was
replying to your reply to my reply to your reply, and it was just getting
silly. In any case, I never wanted to get into a disagreement in the first
place! I blame that guy Tim Rudman for stirring things up!
So I thought the best way to handle this would be to state simply why, after
properly trying f stop printing, I prefer to use linear timing. i.e. I do
not want to attack your preferred method, simply put forward the benefits of
my preferred method.
No doubt you can respond in a similar vein, and rather than attack my method
point by point, simply summarise the benefits of f stop printing. Then let's
draw a line under it. If people want to f stop print, it's fine by me. I
have no wish to persuade people one way or the other. They can try each way,
and choose which they prefer.
I get really worried about evangelist proponents of one method or piece of
equipment - methinks they do protest too much. To your credit, you don't do
this (though, unfortunately, some users do), and your instruments allow
either print exposure method, so there isn't a problem as far as I am
concerned. Indeed I am anxious to support the virtues of your equipment. It
is clearly designed and made by photographers who understand the needs of
real darkroom workers.
Let me mention just one feature to illustrate this. On my Timer 2, when I
press the button to print, if I tap it briefly, the exposure starts
immediately - which is what I want most of the time. However, if I have a
particularly tricky area to dodge, a slightly longer press on the button
introduces a few seconds delay before the lamp illuminates, and I have time
to position my dodger carefully before it starts. A simple feature, but
invaluable in practice, and its operation is intuitive not requiring
programming/unprogramming.
So here goes with the virtues of linear versus f stop:
1. There isn't a  logic for using f stops for enlarger timing. The
frequently propounded 'we use it for cameras, therefore it is logical to use
it for enlargers' is a non-sequitur. There is no connection between the two.
Just because a subject photographed will require one stop more or less
exposure in the camera if it is half/twice its current brightness means
nothing in the exposure of the subsequent print of the subject. The
resulting negative densities are nowhere near half or double density. The
half/double connection is lost.
When we expose a print test strip, we should be trying to find an absolute
exposure figure to yield a highlight tone just off white. This will almost
certainly not be an exact f stop exposure, even if it is divided into1/5 or
1/10 stops (1/5 with log exposure?). Even 1/12 won't do the job with
sufficient exactitude. To expose a fine print and get this critical
highlight just right (and it is critical in fine printing), I often find
myself adjusting a 10 second exposure, say, by 0.1 or 0.2 of a second to get
this right. f stops won't allow me to do this, or not without a lot of
fiddling.
It is immaterial whether going up in exposure by 10% overall, then coming
down by 10% brings you to a different exposure. I don't need or want to do
this. Why would I?
2. The equal density of f stop steps in the test strip is immaterial. I am
interested in only two steps - the one above the highlight exposure needed
and the one below. The finer the span, the better for me. If the one above
is 11 seconds, and the one below 10, but the 11 seconds in nearer, I will
give, say, 10.7 seconds for a complete test strip exposed across the
critical highlight areas. I may have to go up to 10.8 or down to 10.6 based
on the result if it is not quite right. f stop exposure spacing is too wide
for this kind of control.
3. Only after I have assessed highlight exposure will I look at the deepest
shadow area to adjust contrast if necessary. f stops don't have any bearing
on this.
4. The exposure provided by one single exposure of , say, 12 seconds is not
the same as, say six multiple smaller exposures of 2 seconds, or the
composite of f stop test strip exposures. I know this for a fact by trial.
It is nothing to do with a delayed switch on like Durst or Kaiser, nor
anything to do with the type of transformer I use. The bulb simply has a
warm up time each time it is illuminated, and the paper also has a small
intermittency effect. When I last tested it on Ilfospeed paper, the effect
with my set up was that a continuous 10 second exposure equated a 10.4
second using a multiple of 5 shorter exposures. I am aware that I could
programme this difference into the timer, but I don't want to. It takes up
productive time, and I have to change the programming when the parameters
change. By giving multiple bursts of light to expose the final print like
the test strip, I avoid the problem entirely, and also give myself a
repeatable controllable process of dodging for x bursts of exposure in
specific regions of the print. Yes, I could start programming, but I am
sorry - that is much slower than my practical method, and I have to do it
every time for every different print with an f stop timer - uuugh! There is
nothing to stop me programming an especially finicky print with linear
timing of course, but that is a very rare need indeed. I am a commercial
printer earning my living by the speed at which I can produce fine prints. I
know from hard experience that spending time programming and reprogramming
timers does not get the job done faster. It's pretty boring too.
5. I can burn in just as easily as f stop adjustments by using percentages
of the basic exposure - in fact more easily and more exactly. Again no need
to be stuck with f stop time steps relatively large compared to linear
timing. If I do a test strip to assess burning in, I simply compare the
absolute correct time it reveals in reading the critical highlight and use
that for the actual exposure. For record purposes, I can compare that actual
absolute burning in exposure with the correct base exposure, and relate one
to the other by a percentage. If the base time changes for different sized
prints the percentage of newly-ascertained base exposure gives the correct
results very simply.
6. If I make another size of print - for instance the final larger fine
print after working out dodging and burning on a smaller work print - I will
not be able to use an extrapolation of the original base exposure with
either linear or f stop exposure. The oft expressed claim that one can
simply apply a f stop extrapolation based on the magnification scale just
doesn't stack up. Even if we were using the same paper and batch for the
smaller and larger prints, unlikely but possible, there is a reciprocity
effect in exposing paper. In practice, the larger print will be underexposed
by varying amounts depending on the increase in size of enlargement if such
an extrapolation is attempted. No doubt we can programme in some correction,
but different papers react in different ways, and we are back to all that
fiddly programming again.
So do I never use f stop timing? Yes, I use it when using The ZoneMaster
meter, especially when it is linked to my Timer 2. If I have a 36 exposure
roll of 35mm negatives to turn out as work prints for a client, I have come
to know that I can rely utterly on the combination to turn out 36 very
acceptable prints straight off with only the most infrequent reprint
necessary on Ilford Multigrade IV RC using Ilford below the lens filters.
You can turn out very good prints too on Multigrade FB. It is a magic piece
of equipment that I would recommend to anyone, especially since you get a
transmission densitometer into the bargain.
However, when I want to turn out the perfectionist fine print on fibre base
papers of many different kinds using my enlarger's stepless VC head, it's
back to fine tight swift control by linear methods.
Over to you Richard. Don't answer this lot point by point, just set forward
the pro f stop case as you see it. Then let's draw a line under the
discussion.
And somebody shut that Rudman fellow up!

The number of beats for a given print size from a particular negative type

This gives me lens focal length,enlarger height and filtration,print size and

Interesting to use a metronome...I used to use the old...One Potato, Two 
Potato, Three Potato...but had such varied results as my pace would spead or 
slow.  My digital timer is my best friend now...I know it is absolutely 
accurate...easy to see the lighted dial in the dark room, the button is easy 
to find...time easy to change and the constant on switch for burning so close 
to hand.

Besides, I have the radio screaming to keep me awake in the darkroom...the 
metronome would have me in a hypnotic trance.

I have to admit that I never came near this accuracy in my own printing
(which probably says something about my printing..;-)..), but I would
like to ask ( probably running the risk of opening yet another "can of

Barry,

I don't wish to get involved in "heated agreement" re fstop printing but two points arise from your answer to Richard's comments. 

The points relating to one long exposure as against a series of bursts. You stated that, based on your own trial, it is a fact that the single exposure would produce more density. Clearly, as you know what you are doing your darkroom I do accept that statement. However, I did that test yesterday with my Zone VI enlarger and a new timer using Oriental Seagull paper. Both prints dried to an identical density. Two printers, two darkrooms and two conflicting results. We are both right but only for our own set up. Please don't ask me to explain the difference in our experiences on this matter. I simply do my tests and if it works for me I carry on not caring why it did work.

The second point relates to your description of burning in using Timer 2. You said when you hold the start button it gives you a delay to allow you to get your dodging tools in position. Why not use a foot switch? You will always have two hands free.

I have to say that I do enjoy some sensible good old "heated agreement" 

Good printing Barry

Les McLean

Well you have the start of a point.  There is a linear relationship
between the amount of light (time of exposure) and the number of silver
grains that receive enough exposure to turn black once developed.

However, the eye has a logarithmic response curve.  That is why density
measurements are a log scale.  A density of 2 is 10 times more than a
density of 1.  but we perceive the same change in density from 1 to 1.1
as we do from 1.9 to 2.  

Thus it makes sense to use a log timing scale (and it matters nothing if
that be based on 2, 10, e, or even pi, but we photographers are used to
powers of 2).

However, I will agree, that when I find that I need an exposure between
4 and 8 seconds, I may try 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 rather than 4, 4.75, 5.5, 6.75,
8 because the latter is just to hard to remember, and the slight
compression toward one end is not too bad.

However if I was testing over a range of more than a stop, I wouldn't
even consider linear timing.  

Imagine doing film speed tests 1/1000, 2/1000, 3/1000, 4/1000... all the
way to 1 sec (10 stops in 1000 increments.  Can you imagine being able
to perceive the change between 999/1000 and 1/1000 of a sec as much as
1/1000 to 2/1000?

Linear should only be used where a relatively small range is involved
and the ease of use outweighs the compression toward one end.

No, but what does that matter?  we're talking density on the print!  The
same argument would apply for printing an overall single density neg
(shot of a gray card?).  The neg itself is not an issue.

Hahahaha

Who said it had to be an _exact_ f stop value (whatever that
means??????).

If you had to test over a 5 stop range, would you go

1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32

or

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... 32

or

1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 32

and can you justify the second or the third over the first?

Sure, you might end up using 22.5 sec (or whatever) but that doesn't
eliminate the fact that the first test will give you an even apparent
change in density, while the others will give you changes in density all
compressed toward the lower end.

I could sat the same about 0.5 of a second!

And that's why you use logarithmic timing to get into the ball park, and
then use linear timing when the range becomes so small that the
difference does not matter.

When you're adjusting from 10 to 10.1 seconds and then try 10.2 (say). 
The fact that the actual difference between 10 and 10.1 is actually more
than 10.1 to 10.2 is actually greater by .00015 of a stop is not going
to matter to anyone.  But the same would not be true of a change in 0.1
of a second on a 0.05 second exposure (not that you're ever likely to
use anything that short with paper).

No, it doesn't matter.  Unless you want to get to the same point again,

No, just too hard to figure out.  Your statement is like saying that you
don't like the Metric system because the measurements are too big (or
too small).

Hahahaha - yes they do.  You just don't realise it.  Do you realise that
the scale of contrast values is logarithmic?

Yes, I agree with you that there's no point in using a log scale over a
small range, and the better printers we are, the fewer times we need to
use a test strip over many stops.  But if and when we do, a log scale is
just plain smarter than a linear one.

I have been using  a metronome for some time myself. I read about it in an 
article in Photo Techniques (at least I think that's where it was, really not 
sure) and tried it for myself.  It is really quite handy in that you can 
concentrate on the print for burning and dodging and not have to have one eye 
on the timer. Just make sure you don't lose count.  ;-)

I thought it was pretty well accepted, at least for most people (apparently
not for Les for some reason) that 10 2 second bursts (for example) produce a
slightly different exposure than one constant 20 second exposure.  The
reason, I've been told by people who are supposed to know, is that the heat
of the lamp is different with a series of multiple bursts, where the lamp is
turned on and multiple times in quick succession, as opposed to being turned
on only once with a single  constant exposure. I've never done the test
myself though I've seen it demonstrated in a workshop. The demonstration was
done with a condenser enlarger head. Les uses a Zone VI, which is a cold
light. Maybe this makes a difference.

You stated that, based on your own trial, it is a fact that the single
exposure would produce more density. Clearly, as you know what you are doing
your darkroom I do accept that statement. However, I did that test yesterday
with my Zone VI enlarger and a new timer using Oriental Seagull paper. Both
prints dried to an identical density. Two printers, two darkrooms and two
conflicting results. We are both right but only for our own set up. Please
don't ask me to explain the difference in our experiences on this matter. I
simply do my tests and if it works for me I carry on not caring why it did
work.
>

You said when you hold the start button it gives you a delay to allow you to
get your dodging tools in position. Why not use a foot switch? You will
always have two hands free.

The difference of 10% in time is the difference within threshold components
of both negative projection upon and the reaction to photographic paper; so
1/10th of a second more or less would change the highlight prception, of
course.

Dry down is the aspect of the 'pores' of the paper itself closin gup and
making the colors of the emuslion appear 'darker' on the shadow areas of the
picture.  The test for this includes part of the test for the emersion
factor when developing.

Rather than go into all that, the simple test begins with an overall
exposure of one piece of 8X10 paper exposed for 10 seconds at 5.6 under a
focused light ... no negatie or density film in the holder.

You focus that way by rendering clear, clean lines of the light through the
negative carrier at that height.

Then, using your favorite developer, imerse the paper, after 30 seconds cut
off a tenth and mark '1' then after another 10 seconds #2, through #10 when
you have ten pieces of paper, fixed after 30, 40, etc. through a minute and
a half; you can begin at one minute and go to 2 1/2 minutes.  Pick the paper
that has the blackest black next to the one not quite darkest as possible.
Then dry the papers and look at the blacks and you will see the 10%+ or
minus from each exposure, emersion time.

Continue to print, from the first 'good print' plus or minus that percent to
achieve your best print after 'dry down.'

Let me know,
Steve Shapiro

You can microwave the test strip after toning and washing.
If you don't plan to tone just give the test strip a good wash and somewhere
 between 45 seconds and 2 minutes in the microwave depending on size and
micropower.
 This will approximate the look of the normally dried prints well.
I have no Idea what this does to the Microwave but old Ansel himself used
this easy answer.

I have to admit that I never came near this accuracy in my own printing
(which probably says something about my printing..;-)..), but I would
like to ask ( probably running the risk of opening yet another "can of
worms"..) how do you take "dry down" in account in your test strip
procedure?

Thanks,

Cor

The remarks about Tim were very definitely tongue in cheek. Sorry if the
British humour didn't travel too well.
I deal with dry down by briefly washing the test strip, sqeegeeing it, then
putting it in my darkroom microwave for 60 seconds. I have to take my coffee
cup out to make room for it. Ultra highlight densities are incredibly
sensitive to small exposure variations.

I don't wish to get involved in "heated agreement" re fstop printing but two
points arise from your answer to Richard's comments.

The points relating to one long exposure as against a series of bursts. You
stated that, based on your own trial, it is a fact that the single exposure
would produce more density. Clearly, as you know what you are doing your
darkroom I do accept that statement. However, I did that test yesterday with
my Zone VI enlarger and a new timer using Oriental Seagull paper. Both
prints dried to an identical density. Two printers, two darkrooms and two
conflicting results. We are both right but only for our own set up. Please
don't ask me to explain the difference in our experiences on this matter. I
simply do my tests and if it works for me I carry on not caring why it did
work.

The second point relates to your description of burning in using Timer 2.
You said when you hold the start button it gives you a delay to allow you to
get your dodging tools in position. Why not use a foot switch? You will
always have two hands free.

I have to say that I do enjoy some sensible good old "heated agreement"

Hi Les,
Re the foot switch - I don't use it because I fall over when I do. Stupid, I
know, but I do find it difficult to use. My fault, not Richard's foot
switch. Even with the foot switch though, the delay start is useful to get a
dodger precisely in position, especially if the overall print exposure is
short.
Re identical densities from multiple burst or continuous exposure - my test
is on extreme highlights which is where the test strip should be read.

Not really, no.  All we're doing is altering exposure *time* in a sequence
which produces linear changes in the density on the print.  It's ever so
difficult to describe this simply in words, goodness knows I've tried often
enough in the past few years!  It's a concept which, once grasped, will
seem so natural and obvious that you'll wonder why it seemed so hard, but
it isn't easy to get across, especially without a practical demo.

I just wrote a long spiel about it, and then came up with the following
analogy - I've chopped the spiel out because it doesn't help, leaving just
the analogy:

Consider a container which you slowly fill with water. If the container is
cylindrical, it will always take the same amount of additional water, say a
pint, to raise the water level by one inch.  But what happens if the
container is *cone shaped*?  As the container gets fuller, so it takes more
additional water to raise the water level in the container by one inch.  If
you want to incerase the water level by half an inch, how much water do you
need?  The answer depends on how much water is already in the container.
If you have a chart of water level vs volume in the container, you can work
it out beforehand rather than doing it by experiment. If you have a water
supply that has a clever built-in metering device that knows about the
container, you can tell it simply to add enough water to raise the level
half an inch, and it will work out the amount based on how much water it's
already delivered.

Photographic materials behave like cone-shaped containers - the water level
represents the density, the volume of water you pour in represents the
exposure.  An f-stop timer is the clever metering device.

Hope this helps!
Richard

Yes - you simply take another reading at the new enlarger height. It will

*smile* It's a new feature of the Pro and Plus models, yes. You make the
main exposure, increase the exposure time by the desired number of Talbots,
then press and hold the Print button.  The timer works out the required
burn-in exposure and times it for you.  You can use this as many times as
you like until the next short press of the Print button which becomes the
new base exposure time.

Again, the Pro and Plus versions (and the StopClock Professional) allow you
to choose the test strip mode between incremental test strips or full prints.

You need to send it back to us for a new microprocessor to be fitted.  The
Pro versions can be upgraded by the customer, by the way.  The cost is
47.50 GBP in the EU, 40.00 elsewhere.  Sorry, but EU customers have to pay
UK tax, which covers the return postage for non-EU customers.

Well put, Steve. The differences do become trivial when you're down to 1/6
stop (ish) or finer - but if you have an f-stop timer it will maintain the
log response because it's already got the capability built in.

No disagreements, just alternative points of view :-)

Absolutely.  I wasn't aware I was attacking your method, just offering my
point of view, but if it read like an attack then I apologise.

>The
>resulting negative densities are nowhere near half or double density. The
>half/double connection is lost.

The half/double connection when printing refers to the relationship between
exposure and density, which is the same for paper as it is for film.
Certainly, the range of film differs from that of paper but the D/log.E
relationship holds.  Everything to do with photographic exposure is
logarithmic in nature.

>I may have to go up to 10.8 or down to 10.6 based
>on the result if it is not quite right. f stop exposure spacing is too wide
>for this kind of control.

That's about 1/24th stop, the finest step on our latest StopClock. F-stop
exposure has no limts on fine resolution per se, it's just a method of
dividing exposure into little chunks.  Just like dividing a distance into
miles or inches - you choose the most appropriate unit for the job in hand.
 But adding an inch to a mile has minimal effect, adding an inch to an inch
has a great deal.

>3. Only after I have assessed highlight exposure will I look at the deepest
>shadow area to adjust contrast if necessary. f stops don't have any bearing
>on this.

They do - the contrast range of paper is expressed in ISO(R) units.  You'll
find these figures in the Ilford Multigrade data sheet for example. One
ISO(R) unit is 1/30 stop. As you adjust the grade setting on your VC
enlarger head, you're effectively adjusting the exposure at the black end
in f-stop intervals but it's transparent to the user so you simply haven't
been aware that's what you're doing!  If you know the density range of your
negative, you can translate that directly into ISO(R) units and predict
exactly what grade of paper you need to print it on. That's how the
ZoneMaster / Analyser works!

>Over to you Richard. Don't answer this lot point by point, just set forward
>the pro f stop case as you see it. Then let's draw a line under the
>discussion.

Well, I've had to address a couple of individual points but as far as I'm
concerned the line is drawn :-)  Something with a logarithmic response is
in my opinion best controlled logarithmically, that's all there is to it.
That's how I'd fill my conical bucket at any rate :-)

>And somebody shut that Rudman fellow up!

Nah, let him speak, he's on *my* side!

Cheers

A microwave is very useful in the darkroom even if just to assess your test
strips. It can be very frustrating to find a days printing wasted because
drydown was misjudged. A microwave gives you the answer in a minute or so. I
wouldn't personally use my darkroom m'wave for anything other than test
strips etc or occasionally heating up certain chemical (as opposed to
drinkable) brews

I used to use this method many years ago - but it is surprisingly easy to
miscount or just loose concentration for a second or two - and according to
Murphy's Law of the darkroom this always happens on the final step of a
complex multi stage print !

A good electronic timer (type of your choice, but I still strongly recommend
an f-stop timer!) and a footswitch avoids all this aggro, is more accurate
and reliable - and effectively gives you 3 hands which is invaluable
although sometimes I wish I had four!

I have a question for Richard Ross:

    The RH timers are calibrated for 1 or 2 papers. You said that new
calibration for other papers can easily be done .Can you explain briefly how
you do that. I am thinking  about to buy one and would like to know more
before. Many thanks

        Daniel

I would appreciate input from all readers regarding their experience with

acceptable results, most of the time as "first prints" before printing on
conventional paper. I find the MCP OK as regards to Dmax and general
appearance but never as pleasant to look at as a conventional paper.

I certainly like the simple procedure of washing, quite often selenium
toning, drying and a flat copy!
But, the "look" could be better and I could often use a warmer (or at least
less cold) paper.

What is your experience with other RC papers today: Kodak, Ilford, Forte

toning
etc?

I find Agfa Multicontrast warms up nicely in Agfa Neutol WA developer (note:
must be WA) which I dilute between 1:12 and 1:19 instead of the standard 1:7
or 1:9. I step the temperature up to 24 or even 26C to reduce the time back
to 60 seconds. The paper also tones in selenium very nicely after this
development regime, and it also responds particularly well to drag toning.
Ilford Multigrade Warmtone is even warmer, especially in the normally cold
tone Bromophen developer, but you do not have the option of a colder tone
print as you do with Agfa by varying the developer.
Fort Polywarmtone is a lovely warmtone paper, but it is slower and the
contrast range is limited. It responds supremely well to toners, though,
going a lovely chocolate colour in selenium and a marked azure blue in gold.
Hope this helps.

Hi Steve,
I do know what log exposure means. All of the points you raise have been
dealt with in my previous contributions. As I said in my last email in reply
to Richard Ross, I would simply put forward my case for linear then shut up.
I do not intend to get further involved in point-by-point refutation of f
stop proponents' claims.
So, other than to say 'methinks you doth protest too much', I am now
shutting up on this issue.

Well you have the start of a point.  There is a linear relationship
between the amount of light (time of exposure) and the number of silver
grains that receive enough exposure to turn black once developed.

However, the eye has a logarithmic response curve.  That is why density
measurements are a log scale.  A density of 2 is 10 times more than a
density of 1.  but we perceive the same change in density from 1 to 1.1
as we do from 1.9 to 2.

Thus it makes sense to use a log timing scale (and it matters nothing if
that be based on 2, 10, e, or even pi, but we photographers are used to
powers of 2).

However, I will agree, that when I find that I need an exposure between
4 and 8 seconds, I may try 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 rather than 4, 4.75, 5.5, 6.75,
8 because the latter is just to hard to remember, and the slight
compression toward one end is not too bad.

However if I was testing over a range of more than a stop, I wouldn't
even consider linear timing.

Imagine doing film speed tests 1/1000, 2/1000, 3/1000, 4/1000... all the
way to 1 sec (10 stops in 1000 increments.  Can you imagine being able
to perceive the change between 999/1000 and 1/1000 of a sec as much as
1/1000 to 2/1000?

Linear should only be used where a relatively small range is involved
and the ease of use outweighs the compression toward one end.

No, but what does that matter?  we're talking density on the print!  The
same argument would apply for printing an overall single density neg
(shot of a gray card?).  The neg itself is not an issue.

Hahahaha

Who said it had to be an _exact_ f stop value (whatever that
means??????).

If you had to test over a 5 stop range, would you go

1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32

or

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... 32

or

1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 32

and can you justify the second or the third over the first?

Sure, you might end up using 22.5 sec (or whatever) but that doesn't
eliminate the fact that the first test will give you an even apparent
change in density, while the others will give you changes in density all
compressed toward the lower end.

I could sat the same about 0.5 of a second!

And that's why you use logarithmic timing to get into the ball park, and
then use linear timing when the range becomes so small that the
difference does not matter.

When you're adjusting from 10 to 10.1 seconds and then try 10.2 (say).
The fact that the actual difference between 10 and 10.1 is actually more
than 10.1 to 10.2 is actually greater by .00015 of a stop is not going
to matter to anyone.  But the same would not be true of a change in 0.1
of a second on a 0.05 second exposure (not that you're ever likely to
use anything that short with paper).

No, it doesn't matter.  Unless you want to get to the same point again,
which is doubtful.

No, just too hard to figure out.  Your statement is like saying that you

Hahahaha - yes they do.  You just don't realise it.  Do you realise that
the scale of contrast values is logarithmic?

Yes, I agree with you that there's no point in using a log scale over a
small range, and the better printers we are, the fewer times we need to
use a test strip over many stops.  But if and when we do, a log scale is
just plain smarter than a linear one.

Absolutely.  I wasn't aware I was attacking your method, just offering my
point of view, but if it read like an attack then I apologise.

>The

The half/double connection when printing refers to the relationship between
exposure and density, which is the same for paper as it is for film.
Certainly, the range of film differs from that of paper but the D/log.E
relationship holds.  Everything to do with photographic exposure is
logarithmic in nature.

That's about 1/24th stop, the finest step on our latest StopClock. F-stop
exposure has no limts on fine resolution per se, it's just a method of
dividing exposure into little chunks.  Just like dividing a distance into
miles or inches - you choose the most appropriate unit for the job in hand.
 But adding an inch to a mile has minimal effect, adding an inch to an inch
has a great deal.

>3. Only after I have assessed highlight exposure will I look at the deepest

>on this.

They do - the contrast range of paper is expressed in ISO(R) units.  You'll
find these figures in the Ilford Multigrade data sheet for example. One
ISO(R) unit is 1/30 stop. As you adjust the grade setting on your VC
enlarger head, you're effectively adjusting the exposure at the black end
in f-stop intervals but it's transparent to the user so you simply haven't
been aware that's what you're doing!  If you know the density range of your
negative, you can translate that directly into ISO(R) units and predict
exactly what grade of paper you need to print it on. That's how the
ZoneMaster / Analyser works!

>Over to you Richard. Don't answer this lot point by point, just set forward
>the pro f stop case as you see it. Then let's draw a line under the

Well, I've had to address a couple of individual points but as far as I'm
concerned the line is drawn :-)  Something with a logarithmic response is
in my opinion best controlled logarithmically, that's all there is to it.
That's how I'd fill my conical bucket at any rate :-)

>And somebody shut that Rudman fellow up!

Nah, let him speak, he's on *my* side!

Whichever method we use, it beats the 'one elephant, two elephant, three
elephant' technique I used when I first started printing some 40 years ago.
I actually got quite good at this by constant practice, when out driving for
instance, and comparison with my wrist watch second hand.
Actually, what we really need is metric timing with 100 seconds to the
minute, 100 minutes to the hour...

Not really, no.  All we're doing is altering exposure *time* in a sequence
which produces linear changes in the density on the print.  It's ever so
difficult to describe this simply in words, goodness knows I've tried often
enough in the past few years!  It's a concept which, once grasped, will
seem so natural and obvious that you'll wonder why it seemed so hard, but
it isn't easy to get across, especially without a practical demo.

I just wrote a long spiel about it, and then came up with the following
analogy - I've chopped the spiel out because it doesn't help, leaving just
the analogy:

Consider a container which you slowly fill with water. If the container is
cylindrical, it will always take the same amount of additional water, say a
pint, to raise the water level by one inch.  But what happens if the
container is *cone shaped*?  As the container gets fuller, so it takes more
additional water to raise the water level in the container by one inch.  If
you want to incerase the water level by half an inch, how much water do you
need?  The answer depends on how much water is already in the container.
If you have a chart of water level vs volume in the container, you can work
it out beforehand rather than doing it by experiment. If you have a water
supply that has a clever built-in metering device that knows about the
container, you can tell it simply to add enough water to raise the level
half an inch, and it will work out the amount based on how much water it's
already delivered.

Photographic materials behave like cone-shaped containers - the water level
represents the density, the volume of water you pour in represents the
exposure.  An f-stop timer is the clever metering device.

Hope this helps!
Richard

A microwave is very useful in the darkroom even if just to assess your test
strips. It can be very frustrating to find a days printing wasted because
drydown was misjudged. A microwave gives you the answer in a minute or so. I
wouldn't personally use my darkroom m'wave for anything other than test
strips etc or occasionally heating up certain chemical (as opposed to
drinkable) brews

I find the darkroom microwave invaluable. For instance, when using two bath
developer when the ambient temperature is low, by putting equal amounts of A
bath and B bath in matching jugs in the microwave I can raise the
temperature exactly equally very quickly. I guess the same would go for any
combination of solutions where you wanted the exact same final temperature.
take care though, I find that the tops of the jugs I use get quite hot, and
that the temperature of the solutions consequently continues to rise after
removing the jugs of solution from the microwave by transference of this
heat.

I will check and let you know, but it is open all day and I think fairly
late into the evening too, but it is a large glass atrium and relies on
daylight - so that should be the deciding factor

Hi all,

I've come across something, and was wondering if other list members might
have experience, anecdotes or thoughts on the subject. Was talking to a
photographer who used to do press work in the 1950's, with graphics and
sheet film. He commented that the photographers used to use alcohol (ethanol
he thought) to rapid-dry negs. The theory is that the alcohol replaces the
water on the neg, and then evaporates rapidly, allowing the film to be
printed within 5 minutes of being printed.

Does anyone know about the repercussions of this? I have worked at an
archives, and dealt with many press-camera era negs from paper, none of
which suffered from any deterioration that I could see - would using alcohol
in this manner lead to problems, or is it just a lost piece of wisdom that
might still have a place in the 21st century?

Thanks in advance,

e.

Jan,  I primarily use Ilford's multi grade for much of my customer fiber prints
so I tend to use their RC for quick matches.  I have however been using Cachet's
multi grade papers, both RC and Fiber for my personnel work over the last year or
so.  It is a stop slower than the Ilford but it does provide a rich print.  The
RC does have a bit of a curl to it, but not to bad.

A good idea - saves a lot of time and paper, but DON'T use the same 
microwave for food. I often use a 'communal' microwave at my university's 
darkrooms, and have learnt (the breathtaking way!) to stand away from the 
machine when opening it. A lot of students who also use it don't wash their 
tests at all! The resulting cloud of hot fixer fumes that come flowing out 
after drying a test is not at all pleasant.

   This was a pretty standard trick goin back at least as far as the 
1930's.  Ethyl alcohol will definitely work but I think Isopropyl does 
also. I can't find a reference to it and don't remember how much the 
alcohol should be diluted. It should have a little water in it to prevent 
too rapid drying of the emulsion which leaves it with a very fine 
reticulation.

It was THE method of developing aerial recon photographs in the RAF and
USAAF in the Second War.  A roll of film could be developed and dried in
under five minutes -- the image stability (er, sorry, I'm not an artsy
Yuppy -- the "archival quality") was damned close to zero, but prints could
be made for a couple of hours before the negatives became unuseable.

And it was wood alcohol, not grain.  A fellow I interviewed one time
commented, "hell, we DRANK all the grain alcohol!"

when I work for a newspaper in 1970-71,
we used a seemlier method, after 5' wash we took a white bowl with one part
methanol  = three parts water in it, we took the film from the thank and out
the spiral and took in one hand one end of the film and in the other the
other end and so took the film ten times through the bowl.
after this we only had to dry the film for +/- 30 sec with a hairdryer
after the prints where made the film would be washed for 15' and dryer
without head.
I never have seen a negative again from this period I even think they aren't
printable now .

i find rc papers repulsive to the touch and feel- and lacking in tonal range- 
i do not think that they are worth printing on except for contacts-ron

We used a commercial product with a name like QuickDry  or FastDri or

A microwave is very useful in the darkroom even if just to assess your test
strips. It can be very frustrating to find a days printing wasted because
drydown was misjudged. A microwave gives you the answer in a minute or so. I
wouldn't personally use my darkroom m'wave for anything other than test
strips etc or occasionally heating up certain chemical (as opposed to
drinkable) brews
Tim


I find the darkroom microwave invaluable. For instance, when using two bath
developer when the ambient temperature is low, by putting equal amounts of A
bath and B bath in matching jugs in the microwave I can raise the
temperature exactly equally very quickly. I guess the same would go for any
combination of solutions where you wanted the exact same final temperature.
take care though, I find that the tops of the jugs I use get quite hot, and
that the temperature of the solutions consequently continues to rise after
removing the jugs of solution from the microwave by transference of this
heat.

Hi Daniel

Just to clarify - Calibration only applies to the Analyser and ZoneMaster
exposure meters, the timers don't need to be calibrated.

The meters can store calibration data for up to 8 papers, with exposure and
contrast data stored for each full grade.  The calibration procedure is
starightforward. First of all, the exposure offset is determined by making
a test strip at the highlight end of the scale.  This will produce a series
of very pale tones, probably starting at paper base. You choose the tone to
which you want to set the white end of the scale - we usually suggest
approx Zone VIII i.e. highlight with perceptible detail. If this tone is
not in the middle of the test strip, the exposure calibration needs
adjustment. If for example it's two steps to the light side, the meter is
overexposing and you need to reduce the exposure. Everything is done in
steps, so two steps on the test strip means an exposure adjustment of -2 is
required.

Once this is done for each full grade, the contrast range is calibrated by
making test strips at the black end. Again, if the required Zone I tone is
not in the center of the test strip, the contrast range needs adjustment in
a similar manner.

You can choose your own end points for the calibration - if you like punchy
prints then choose a paler white and a darker black when you set the end
points.  You can also make your own grey scale on your preferred paper so
that the meter's indications are even more accurate.

Once this cal process is done, it doesn't need to be repeated unless or
until something changes - such as a change of developer or enlarger bulb.
We've found that the batch to batch consistency of modern b/w papers is
very good and it's unlikely that occasional cal checks will be necessary in
most cases.

Hope that helps!
Richard

Not to start a war, but some of the E surface RC papers today are really
quite nice and not at all plasticky.

A microwave is very useful in the darkroom even if just to assess your test
strips. It can be very frustrating to find a days printing wasted because
drydown was misjudged. A microwave gives you the answer in a minute or so. I
wouldn't personally use my darkroom m'wave for anything other than test
strips etc or occasionally heating up certain chemical (as opposed to
drinkable) brews
Tim


I find the darkroom microwave invaluable. For instance, when using two bath
developer when the ambient temperature is low, by putting equal amounts of A
bath and B bath in matching jugs in the microwave I can raise the
temperature exactly equally very quickly. I guess the same would go for any
combination of solutions where you wanted the exact same final temperature.
take care though, I find that the tops of the jugs I use get quite hot, and
that the temperature of the solutions consequently continues to rise after
removing the jugs of solution from the microwave by transference of this
heat.

Tetenal's Drysonal does exactly this off the shelf today.I don't know what
its effect on film permanence might be. My guess is that if the film was
washed properly before hand, which takes very little time if done correctly,
the longevity of the film is unaffected. But that is a guess. As an ex
newspaper man myself, I have heard about news films soaked in methylated
spirits after a wash actually ignited to burn off the vapours and dry the
film simultaneously. Never saw this done though.

Subject: Film Drying


Hi all,

I've come across something, and was wondering if other list members might
have experience, anecdotes or thoughts on the subject. Was talking to a
photographer who used to do press work in the 1950's, with graphics and
sheet film. He commented that the photographers used to use alcohol (ethanol
he thought) to rapid-dry negs. The theory is that the alcohol replaces the
water on the neg, and then evaporates rapidly, allowing the film to be
printed within 5 minutes of being printed.

Does anyone know about the repercussions of this? I have worked at an
archives, and dealt with many press-camera era negs from paper, none of
which suffered from any deterioration that I could see - would using alcohol
in this manner lead to problems, or is it just a lost piece of wisdom that
might still have a place in the 21st century?

Thanks in advance,

e.

Many moons ago when RC paper did not exist I used to rapid dry (well
actually tacky dry) prints by a final soak in a meths. bath then holding up
by one corner to let the worst of the meths. drip off and then set the print
alight (well away from the meths. bath) with a match and immediately shake
very hard so that it extinguished rapidly. Worked OK when in a hurry but was
VERY DANGEROUS.

Before going too far on 'lacking in tonal range', perhaps you better check
the total range available on the best RC papers with a densitometer. It may
surprise you when you see some of them with a greater range than the finest
fibre papers.

Tim, would it be asking too much for you to unearth the contact info for 
this organization?  My Internet search, using a number of different US & 
international search engines, yielded nothing.  Please feel free to respond 
to me directly if you think it appropriate.

Thanks!

I use 90% rubbing alcohol, about 20% by volume in distilled water with a 
few drop of fotoflow as the final prep for drying.  The alcohol seems to 
make it flow off better than just fotoflow.  However, this is not a 
scientifically controlled observation.

A bit like the old Windmill Theatre then - "We never close" - but probably
not as popular as some members of the male public who liked the the images
they looked at to be in three dimensions, not two!
I'll definitely make a trip to see it Tim.

  For UK readers:

  For information, The London Salon of Photography has opened its 89th

  exhibition in London.

  The exhibition can be seen at The Cottons Centre, London Bridge City,
Tooley
  Street, London Bridge, London SE1. from Sunday 9th July to Saturday 22nd
  July.

    Admission is free

  As usual, members of the London Salon exhibit work alongside a selection

  'exhibition 2000' we have also included a retrospective selection of
  previous members work since the Salon was formed in 1910 - previously 'The
  Linked ring' which was founded in 1892

  work in which there is distinct evidence of artistic feeling and
execution."

  Do come and see it if you can.

Really? What do you mean by tonal range? You may not like the appearance and
feel of RC papers, and may have doubts about their archival properties, but
tonal range is an area where they match or even exceed many fibre base
papers.

I thought that the object of newsgroups was to share photographic views and ideas. I feel that the number of emails relating to visiting this exhibition and opening times should be private and not form part of the daily newsgroup communications. I understand the need to advertise such shows and their importance to the photographic public and therefore have no problem with a once only entry to pure-silver.

Can you name some examples?
 all the spec sheets I've read show the RC version of a photo paper has a 
lower range then the fiber version of the "same" emulsion

  Compare the density specs given in the Kodak data sheets to be found on
their web site. One must compare paper of the same surface. The full range
is available only with glossy surface, any sort of surface texturing will
cause some diffuse reflection from the paper surface causing a loss of both
contrast and Dmax.
  Typical papers of both kinds have Dmax ranging from about 1.8 to 2.2. In
no case is the Dmax actually produced by real negatives, only with gross
exposure to get the maximum amount of silver in the image. 
  BTW, Dr. Richard Henry proved long ago that so called silver-rich
emulsions are bunk. The amount of silver varies little among emulsions and
the Dmax does not follow the amount of silver.

 I,m afraid I missed the AP article on the MPP as I only get the View Camera
mag. but will try for a back issue if I can.
The weight of the MPP Mk.6 body stripped for backpacking is 2385gms (2,385
kgs.) without lens which I don't think is too bad.
Would the Wista 5 x 4 be lighter?

Regards

JR

Some good news for you people in the UK. I just had a 'phone call from
Martin Reed at Silverprint to say that, following my recent piece about it
in Ag magazine, he has now imported some Verichrome Pan and it is now in
stock there.
I don't know what the price is, and how it compares with buying from Adorama
in the US, which is what I did recently.
For those who don't know - Silverprint are at 12 Valentine Place, London SE1
8QH, and their 'phone is 0171 620 0844

Did you add hydroquinone when the 2 other chemicals are dissolved? Metol is
very soluble in water so does is sodium sulphite. you should not get any
problem .Can you precise the quantities of the chemicals you are using and
the volume of water.

  It would be useful to know what formula you are mixing (is it only one?)
and what procedure and order you are using.
  Is the hydroquinone the only chemical from new stock?

I don't normally mix at over 40C with metol/hydroquinone brews. Does 52C
sound OK to you? I guess Lorena must have mixed at this temperature before,
so maybe it isn't a factor.

  52C or 125F is the temperature specified by Kodak and others for most
developer formulas. I am not sure what the upper limit is to avoid
decomposition. Hydroquinone is not very soluble in cold water but is quite
soluble in hot water. 
  Hydroquinone is usually added after the sulfite and before the alkali
accelerator.
  Metol will not dissolve in a sulfite solution so must be mixed before the
sulfite, but that doesn't seem to be the problem here.
  I asked about new chemicals as a way of isolating the problem. If
everything worked OK before and the Hydroquinone is the only thing new or
different it certainly suggests its the problem. If other chemicals have
also been renewed things become more difficult. 
  I am not an expert in chemical analysis, I don't know of a simple test
for the Hydroquinone. It should be silky looking long white needles.
  I would try mixing some of the Hydroquinone in hot water by itself and
also in a solution of Sulfite to see if it goes into solution properly. 
  As a rule its a good idea to boil even distilled water briefly (three
minutes) to drive off dissolved gasses, probably not a factor here.

Hi Barry

We have just developed a roll of FP4 plus in DiXactol and sure enough we
have very printable negatives from our 35mm film enlarging to 9x12 we
will try some more.  However I had to use some of this modern stuff
recently, Delta 100 as it was all I could get at the time, I have read
the past emails looking for the time to develop Delta 100, my question
is how long should this be in the developer for?

I've been mixing my own developers from bulk chemicals and have encountered 
a sudden problem with the hydroquinone. -I'm using a metol/hydroquinone 
recipe. When I add the hydroquinone to the metol and sodium sulphite, it 
forms soft fluffy looking crystals which go crunchy when the mixture cools.
I've only been having this trouble recently and was wondering if it may be a 
'bad' batch of hydroquinone. It's only been happening since I bought the new 
batch of chemicals. I've had no problems with the formula until now. I'm 
using distilled water and mixing it at 52 degrees C.
Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance,

Lorena Carrington.

Hi Sylvia and Malcolm
Depending on the subject brightness range, your enlarger set up (condenser
or diffused etc.), and 'standard' printing paper, pretty well all films take
between 7 and 8 minutes in DiXactol single bath option (sheet film users
often extend this by a further minute). For Delta 100 I use 7 minutes. Delta
100 and DiXactol is a particularly effective combination. There are a few
odd exceptions to the 7 - 8 minute rule. Delta 400 is one of them. It needs
about 91/2 minutes. I much prefer HP5 Plus in DiXactol at this speed. Don't
use DiXactol for Delta 3200, or any other 'super' speed film.
You can try partial stand development with Delta 100 in DiXactol for extra
compensation and adjacency effects that show up most on 35mm. For this I
would agitate continuously for the first minute, then once again at 4
minutes. You may find you need slight extension of the time with this
technique - maybe another 30 seconds.

Hi Barry

We have just developed a roll of FP4 plus in DiXactol and sure enough we
have very printable negatives from our 35mm film enlarging to 9x12 we
will try some more.  However I had to use some of this modern stuff
recently, Delta 100 as it was all I could get at the time, I have read
the past emails looking for the time to develop Delta 100, my question
is how long should this be in the developer for?

What is the water volume for the quantities of the chemicals. You should 
first dissolve the metol when dissolution is complete add sulphite until it
dissolves and then hydroquinone. Dissolution should be easier with constant
stirring.

====================
Actually, it is quite possible the plastic measuring jug.

I used to mix my chemical while I was still in Taiwan
and I had had the same problem, the hydroquinone just won't
dissolve. I would like to mention, though, it sometime happens
sometime doesn't (so, it has nothing to do with the possibility
of bad hydroquinone. It happened with Hydroquinon came from
Photogeaphers formulary in the US, also happened with those came from
Japan, and later those made in Taiwan, cheap 99% pured hydroquonone)

Until now, I have no answer to what happened? the following are
just what I do to such a problem (or say just my experience)

When the hydroquinone won't dissolve. I heated the solution,
sometime very hot, hoping to get things better.. it helps, but
not really. (how hot? I had tried added boiled water to solution)

I did found I do not have any problem if I am mixing D76, and this
caused me wondered about the volume of chemical I was mixing as
problem always happened when I mixed D72 for 5 liter or so. So I tried
just use little water in the beginning and then add more and more water
(hot water ,sometimes). I also tried put 3/4 of water as what we should
do. Both seems not the answer...

I tried and failed, I dump the failed solution, WASH jar and tried again
It still happened. I dump again, wash jar again, it still happened.

Finally, I decided completely wash my mixing jar and everything else
I wash them VERY VERY VERY complete. Problem solved!

I knew these doesn't make any sense. so, sometimes, when problem happened
I simply wash my jar by putting it under water to make the jar full and then
dump water then, full water again and dump water..., Hydroquinone still
won't dissolve.... I have to wash(I would say clean, not wash) the jar very
hard (I use foto-finish, and repeat doing it three times or so), problem
disappeared.

Today, I still feel it doesn't make sense the jar has anything to do with
this problem. But that's my experience. I did and still do wash my jar every
time I have use it. My only explanation/guess is that sometime a jar that
looks been cleaned well actually is not. and we somehow are hurry in doing
our next step, so we just not have clean the jar good enough, so the problem
will happen next time you use it (at that old days, I tried at least 50% of
formulas listed in 'cookbook', the jars was used often and replaced with new
one once for while)

I am shamed to tell the above, it sounds funny.(PS: I was very careful clean
my mixing jar before I discovered this problem, proved by high water bill
:-),  but it seems just not enough.) May be my jar cleaning tech. is just
not good enough?

Hope you guys understand my English

I used 10g of metol, 80g of sodium sulphite and 20g of hydroquinone. The 
formula is my own recipe for a warm toned paper developer. It still gives 
beautiful results, but needs to be shaken well before dilution! Both the 
metol and the hydroquinone came in the new batch of chemicals.
I'll do some more tests...

The developing agents probably are coming out of solution due to the low
pH
of the developer (lower than fine grain film developers.) The phenolic
groups 
of both metol and hydroquinone must be converted to anionic form by the
removal
of protons, and likewise, the sulfate (sulfuric acid salt) of metol must
be neutralized. That won't occur under these conditions, but the partial
neutralization will drop the pH down to a region where hydroquinone is
completely inactive, and metol is only partially active. At pH's in the 5
to
7 range, metol and hydroquinone aren't effectively ionized and may come
out 
of solution.

You could increase the amount of water since you dilute the developer
anyway,
or add base to keep the agents in solution, to activate them, and to
buffer
the acid released as a product of development. I'd start with the
addition of 
15 to 45 g of sodium carbonate monohydrate to your formula.

However, without high bromide concentrations and high dilutions, the warm

tone effect may be lost, so consider adding 2 g potassium bromide to the 
formula. The warm tone is primarily due to fine grain development at the 
low pH of your developer. 

The usual approach to warm developers is to use a developer containing
only 
hydroquinone as the agent (HQ is inherently fine grain), or to use dilute

developers with high bromide levels.

Some examples are given below. Most of these were used with warm tone
chloride
or chlorobromide emulsions, and will not be as warm with modern papers.

G-253 requires more bromide for warm effects (2 - 4 g/l stock).
When comparing formulas, note dilutions and times.

The water volume is 750ml.
Yes, I do start with metol, then sodium sulphite, etc... And I certainly 
make sure each chemical is dissolved before adding the next. It's just when 
the hydroquinone is added that I have a problem.
My last logical possibility is that it may be reacting with the plastic 
measuring jug. -Probably not very likely though...

Consider adding the metaborate before you add the hydroquinone. It
should go into solution quicker and stay there. If you still have
problems, you can use twice the volume of water to make the stock, and a
1:5 dilution to make up the working solution.

I may be wrong, but isn't hydroquinone soluble in alcohol?  I understood
that you could dissolve the hydroquinone in alcohol then pour this into
the mix.

Thanks for the technical info.
I just realised that I should mention the entire formula. Myself not being a 
chemistry expert (undestatement of the year), it may not be the ideal 
recipe, but it has given me some wonderful results.

Metol: 10g
Sodium sulphite: 80g
Hydroquinone: 20g
Sodium metaborate: 80g
Potassium bromide: 10g

Dilute 1:10

The high concentration of bromide does slow it down a little, but I've found 
that prolonged development (about 4 minutes) gives a richer tone to the 
print.

    There is some think wrong in your chemistry. Removing the phenolic 
proton of both metol and hydroquinone can be done only in alcaline medium
and not at Ph<7 ( it is why you add sodium carbonate in the different
formula).In addition sodium sulfite is added as a buffer to keep the pH more
or less constant.

Sulfur dioxide is irritating (the odor of fixer), however 
the reaction of susceptible people is usually coughing or
more rarely, and asthmatic attack. The only real problem
with developing agents in solution is contact dermatitis.

I'd suggest that you see a specialist in internal medicine.
There are a number of conditions which can cause pain when 
breathing such as pleurisy, pneumonia (due to infection,
pulmonary hypertension, etc.), a pulmonary embolism,
a tumor...

Hello.  I am very glad to find out that this list still exists.  I was on
it several years ago and then couldn't find any information about it on the
internet when I wanted to get back on.  But then today, thanks to google, I
found it again.

My question is about darkroom ventilation. I have been working in a
darkroom this summer at an art school in Houston, the Glassell School. It
looks like a very nice darkroom, but after about three weeks of working in
it, I started to have pain in my chest and it hurt to breathe sometimes.  I
asked the person who runs the darkroom and the maintenance guy if it was
adequately ventilated, and they both thought it was.

I worked for nine months in another lab at the University of Houston and
never had any problems.  So, I can't understand why I have suddenly started
to have lung problems in connection with working in a darkroom.  Here are
some hypotheses:

1)  This darkroom actually isn't very well ventilated, contrary to what the
people who work there think.  It should be noted that the woman who runs
the darkroom never actually works in it; only students do.

2)  I was spending more hours in the darkroom this summer.  Instead of
about 12 hours a week, I was spending more like 20-25.

3) I was also exposed to ozone due to air pollution in Houston the first
week of July.

4)  I have been working in darkrooms a lot since last fall, and it finally
just got to me.

5)  They use different chemicals in the darkroom at the glassell school.
Specifically, they use Sprint chemicals from a school of photography in
Maine.  These are *supposed* to actually be safer than, say, the usual
Kodak chemicals, less allergenic.

I got a book from amazon called Overexposure:  Health Hazards in
Photography.  This is an exhaustive treatment of possible health problems
related to photography, and it is so encyclopedic that it was a bit
difficult to pin down what might be causing problems at the Glassell
School.  But based on my reading, I think it is sulfur dioxide.  I am
curious to see what other people on this list think, and what experiences,
if any, you have had working in different darkrooms with different
ventilation systems.  I would love any suggestions as to how to prevent
this problem from developing again in the future.  My class at the Glassell
School is almost over, so I may just stop going in that darkroom.  But in
August, I am going back to the University of Houston, where I am a
photography major, and I am worried that the problem will recur.

Fortunately at U of H we have a brand new darkroom.  It seems adequately
ventilated, as there is an overhead vent and an open, maze-style door
rather than a rolling darkroom door, so there is a lot of clean air coming
in, unlike at the Glassell school which has the barrel-type door.  As I
said I never had any problems at that darkroom last year, but I wonder if
now I have become "sensitized" and even minor exposure will bother me.
What to do?

and I think you may be right ;-)  (your spelling certainly was)

and from a book I have here, regarding mixing developers...

"In formulae containing metol, add a small amount (a pinch) of sodium
sulphite before adding the metol to inhibit atmospheric oxidation, then
add the bulk of the sodium sulphite after the metol has dissolved
completely"

I would tend to suggest that dissolved gasses would be the problem here,
and the suggestion to boil first to drive them off is also a good one.

Ventilation may be a problem.  First, are the filters (if there are any) on
the make-up air vents plugged or do they need changing?  Is there a way for
enough make-up air to easily get into the darkroom?  Air flow through the
room should be at least one room volume every 15 minutes and preferrably a
change of air every 10 minutes.  Also the use of a slot type or other
localized exhaust at the processing sink will help to remove the odors
associated with B&W chemicals - acetic acid from the stop and fixer, sulfur
dioxide from the fixer.  The other things that are present do not get into
the air (unless they are spilled and dried - then you have DUST problems-
like little bits of fixer or developer landing on your film and paper!)  Yes
the volumes of air that need to be moved do lead to some significant heating
and air conditioning costs.

>2)  I was spending more hours in the darkroom this summer.  Instead of
>about 12 hours a week, I was spending more like 20-25.

More time means more exposure and a better chance to become sinsitized to
something that does not agree with you.  If it was sulfur dioxide, you
should notice that almost immediatly.  It is not sensitization, it is flat
out-and-out irritation.  Burning sharp odor, sore throat, watering nose and
eyes, headache.  The stuff smells like burning sulfur - cuz that is what
burning sulfur makes.

You were exposed to the wonderful Houston "air" before.
>

That can happen, but it usually causes one to want to hang upside down in
dark locations during daylight hours and have a craving for bugs.

>5)  They use different chemicals in the darkroom at the glassell school.

Sulfur dioxide from the fixer is a source of throat and lung irritation in
poorly ventilated darkrooms.  Improved ventilation and/or local exhaust at
the sink is one solution.  Also the use of "F-6" type fixers (Sodium
metaborate instead of boric acid) have reduced sulfur dioxide emissions
compared to the older "F-5" fixer formulaton.  If it is sulfur dioxide, the
odor should be quite  obvious!  Acetic acid from the fixer and stop baths
are an nusance irritant rather than a serious health problem.  Could go to a
citric acid stop bath instead and cut down on some of the vinegar smell.

One other problem could be mold growing an various damp or wet locations
that are not kept clean.  Check on the general housekeeping of the darkroom.
Airborne mold can get to be a real bugger in warm high humidity locations -
Houston, poorly ventilated darkrooms, etc.- and one can become sensitized to
the little critters and develop allergic reactions.   Mold/mildew growth in
darkoooms can be a real problem since all of the conditions are present that
they like.

Hope the ramblings of an old chemist have been of some help.

I asked the maintenance man about the air vents, and he said that in the
upstairs darkroom, which is older, he had indeed found that the filters
were plugged because they had not been replaced in a long time.  But, he
changed them. Still, that darkroom causes problems for me, after the change
of filters.  But it is a small, cramped space and I suspect that the number
of air changes is not sufficient.It is vented to an attic-like space in the
building, from which the new air is drawn.  Therefore the new air is
slightly contaminated, although the contaminants should be diluted.
However, this same ventilation system vents all the other studios, like oil
painting, sculpture, etc.  No telling what other chemicals are in the
constantly re-circulating air.

  The downstairs darkroom is vented to the outside, supposedly.  I noticed
that the screen over that vent was very dusty and pointed it out to him.

  Is there a way for

The make-up air comes through the air conditioning system and blows down
from the ceiling. Unfortunately, the out-take vent is also in the ceiling.
I wonder if that is part of the problem.  The book I read said that it is
better if the new air comes in at floor level so that it can circulate
through the room before being drawn out. Otherwise there are dead air
pockets.


I asked about the number of exchanges per hour.  The maintenance man said
he would talk to the engineer about that on Monday.

Aha.  Interesting. Maybe I should check the formulation.

  Shannon, follow Mike's advise and get to a doctor. Chest pain can be a
sign of serious problems and should  _always_ be checked out. You _may_
just be very sensitive to something in the fumes but this is _not_ a
typical symptom. Get thee to a doctor and the sooner the better. 
  If you don't have a personal doctor find a good teaching hospital in your
area and visit their clinic. Tell them you have intermittent chest pain and
they will not keep you waiting.

I am an amateur photographer (snap shooter) from the central US. I shoot
medium format (6X6) and 35 mm.
This is my 6th year of photography.

I have been using the Beseler 23cII-XL with the Aristo V54 cold light.  I
use vc printing paper.  This arrangement requires placing filters directly
beneath the lens.  I am considering purchasing the Beseler 23cIII-XL with
the vc head or the Saunders 670 VCCE.  I can get either for about $800 w/o
accessories.  Another possibility is the Aristo VCL4500 f/Beseler 23c Head
at $1100.  All of these are expensive (to me) solutions to the problem(??)
of below the lens filtering, but I want my prints to be as good as I can
possibly make them.

Any opinions?  Specifically, how does the new Beseler compare to the new
Saunders?  Anyone using the Aristo VCL4500 and can tell me about it?  Should
I use my money for something else and not worry about below the lens
filtering?  (I am not able to access someone else's enlarger with one of my
negatives to try side by side testing.)

TIA, Mike<dorsett@blueriver.net>

If your maximum negative size is 6x6 consider buying a used Omega B-66 
with a chromega color head on it.
Try  the web site address for Harry Taylor's Classic Enlargers
http://members.aol.com/cenlarger/homepage.html
I'm sure there were other similar enlargers offered by the top 
manufacturers.
I use the above combination for fine printing. It is a diffused light 
source and the color filters are used to dial in the filtration for 
variable contrast b/w printing.
As long as you already have a high-quality (El-Nikkor,Componon, etc.) 
enlarging lens, the used enlargers are cheap. 
and get those filters away above the lens where they belong!

  Give some thought to simply replacing the cold light head with a dichro
head; that'll give you continuously-variable filtration and a diffuse light
source just like the cold light.

I think maybe you should keep what you have and consider a better enlarging 
lens.  I think that would be the most improvement you could make.  The 
below the lens filter situation to my eye seems not an issue that it might 
have once been.  It is not a convenient but is it worth $1100.00 for a new 
head.  I have used both the v.54 head and the VCL head that I presently 
own.  Both work, both allow you to make excellent prints, the VCL is a 
little easier and possibly faster but that is about it.  I got my head used 
for about 1/2 price and that is the only way I could justify it.  The next 
thing to improve the print quality is to move into larger and larger 
formats (4x5 or so)(Square inches really does count).  That is a separate 
issue.  Improving processing skills is just as important.  Just buying a 
new rig might be the most satisfying thing but there are better and cheaper 
ways to improve print quality.  Good luck!

Hi -

Don't waste your money.  The 23CII and cold light are fine.  I don't think
you've been getting the response you were seeking to your query: there is
no image degradation from using below-the-lens VC filters.  It's a
non-issue.  Invest in the best lens you can afford.

If an opportunity does ever present itself for an upgrade, remember, the
basements of America are full of this stuff.  I picked up a like new Omega
D4 with rails, 2 componons and cones, chromega head, power supply, etc.
for $400!  Three grand worth of machine.  I've been making exhibition
prints for thirty-five years and have NEVER bought anything new.  Most
people go into photography like they go into a diet and the fad wears off
all too quickly.  Capitalize on their mistake!

Curt

Hi Mike - I've been using the VCL 4500 for about four years, in conjunction
with the Metrolux timer, and have been very pleased with it. It is MUCH more
convenient than filters, plus it gives you greater contrast options since it
is adjustable in tenths rather than halves. As you know, if's fairly
expensive but seems quite reliable so you should be able to keep it a long
time.

Hello,
I really think Curt's advice is worth following.
I bought a Focomat IIc with all the bells and whistles, did some printing
with it, and just sold it on ebay. Went back to my good old 23 CII with an
Aristo V54 cold light (yes, just like yours). Now sitting next to a good old
Beseler 45. And I think I will stay like that, because the money, as far as
I'm concerned, is better spent on film, paper and chemicals.
Trust me, you have a fine enlarger. If you really want to buy something, I
would suggest an alignement tool (Beseler or other). That may make a big
difference, when your enlarger is correctly aligned. And as for the filters
under the lens, they don't bother sharpness or focus in a way your eye could
see. And with the Beseler, you can change them to split print or
dodging/burning or whatever without messing any settings.
Gosh... didn't know I could write so much...

Hi -

Don't waste your money.  The 23CII and cold light are fine.  I don't think
you've been getting the response you were seeking to your query: there is
no image degradation from using below-the-lens VC filters.  It's a
non-issue.  Invest in the best lens you can afford.

If an opportunity does ever present itself for an upgrade, remember, the
basements of America are full of this stuff.  I picked up a like new Omega
D4 with rails, 2 componons and cones, chromega head, power supply, etc.
for $400!  Three grand worth of machine.  I've been making exhibition
prints for thirty-five years and have NEVER bought anything new.  Most
people go into photography like they go into a diet and the fad wears off
all too quickly.  Capitalize on their mistake!

Thanks to everyone for the great responses!

If I keep this enlarger, I will invest in an alignment tool. (I previously
used a carpenter square and level).  My present lenses are Schneider
Componon-S 50 and 80 mm, recent vintage. Good enough? I will purchase and
use the VCL 4500 if I find the same or a better deal than Mr. Carmichael
found!  I would love to "broaden" my negative to 4X5 or 8X10; which, hmmm,
would definitely require a different enlarger.  I think I'll try to conquer
the  nuances of the 2 1/4 square first.  If an Omega B-66 with a color head
shows up at a bargain basement price, I will try running both enlargers, and
do some side by side comparing!!


Thanks again for the help,
Mike<dorsett@blueriver.net>

Buying an enlarger tool may not have much advantage over
buying two flat mirror tiles.
Here's an old article I wrote...
... From: fateman@peoplesparc.Berkeley.EDU (Richard J Fateman)
Newsgroups: rec.photo
Subject: Re: DARKROOM: tips on enlarger alignment
Date: 7 Jun 1994 03:31:47 GMT

I'm assuming you know how to adjust the baseboard, lensboard and the
negative carrier, but would just like to know that they are in
parallel planes.  Here's a technique I used.  get 1 or 2 mirror tiles
(about $1.00 each?). They are 12" by 12".  cut one into two strips
about 12" by 6".  Now think about what would happen if you put one on
the baseboard and the other in the negative carrier, with shiny sides
facing each other. (there is a piece sticking out of the neg.
carrier...)
If they were truly exactly parallel, then a point image 
introduced between them would reflect up down up down...  losing a
little
bit each time..  Of course you'd never see this because if you put
your head in the way, you'd block it.

So here's the trick.  scratch a 1" clear circle of the backing off one
of the mirrors, and draw a bulls-eye/cross-hair with a marker. Look
through the circle and if you see the 2nd reflection of the circle
with  your eye in it exactly inside the first reflection, the planes are
parallel.  If the enlarger head is cranked up higher, you get a
bigger "lever", and a more accurate measure, though it will be harder
to see (dimmer)  and you will have to stand on a chair.
(You leave the room lights on for this.)


                            enlarger head (not used here)
            your eye    
          -----  -----------negative carrier
                             |
                             |
                             |
                             | column
         ===================== baseboard with mirror on it.

You should get the idea.  Scratching the back of the mirror can
be done with a single-edged razor.  The shavings are (I think)
harmless aluminum and copper (not mercury, for example).

You can and should do the same kind of thing with the lens board.

(In fact, the most important alignment is carrier to lens; the
baseboard can be off somewhat.)

My impression is that the beseler alignment is hard to attain,
and hard to maintain uniformly at all heights.

  The typical dichroic filter color head uses a highly diffuse mixing
chamber. If anything it is more diffuse, or at least more uniform, than a
cold light head.
  Depending on the particular filter characteristics a color head may not
yield quite the full contrast range of the paper; the paper may be capable
of slightly higher or lower contrast at its limits than can be had with the
filters. However, it is a very small limitation for a source which is much
more satisfactory for VC than cold light.
  A color head will also allow working in color, if you decide you want to,
which a VC head will not. It also allows matching of the filter
requirements of any VC paper.

  I bought the Versalab laser alignment gizmo a couple of years ago.
Although it was expensive it's been a good investment.
  Just don't go overboard with it; you'll spend all your time doing nothing
but realigning your enlarger. <g>

>How does a dichroic head shape up to a condenser head for B&W? 

  Printing silver film with a condenser head shows the Callier effect,
which is an disproportionate increase in the printing density of denser
areas of a neg; this is because the grains literally block some of the
collimated light. Diffusion heads don't cause this effect.
  Compensating by lowering paper contrast may give an unwanted decrease in
contrast in midtone and shadow areas.
  Using a film that has a distinct shoulder or developing a film to give it
a shoulder may moderate difficulties caused by the Callier effect.
  To put it in perspective, printing differences due to the Callier effect
are most likely lost in the mix of exposure, developing, film and paper
differences and variations, so it's not something to get really worked up
over.

  It's been my experience that the (presumed) quality of the condensers is
important. I have no numbers or measurements to back it up, just a feeling,
but I've found Durst condenser heads to print...shall we say smoother...and
Omega and Beseler, which I'd characterise as harsh.

> Is a dichroic head the same as a difussion enlarger head? 

  A diffusion head is simply a type of enlarger light source that has a
translucent diffusion plate over the negative so that the negative is
illuminated by scattered, diffuse light rather than focused collimated light.
  The light itself could be a fluorescent tube(s) arrayed above the
diffuser, a tungsten lamp shining into a mixing box above the diffuser or a
flashtube(s) with mixing box. The mixing box is usually simply a box that
has a white inside with the diffuser attached to the bottom.
  A dichroic head contains a mechanism to move three filters in front of
the light source; a VC head is essentially the same thing with only the two
filters needed for printing on VC paper. A variation is the flashtube head
such as the Beseler 45A that uses pulsed flashtubes rather than a
continuous lamp.
  A cold light head simply has a fluorescent tube bent into what's
considered to be a good shape for even illumination above the diffuser.
BTW, the only reason it's called a cold light head is that it doesn't get
_hot_.
  This thumbnail sketch ignores any electronics used to memorize settings,
calculate grade filtration or exposure, a CC reader etc.

  It's said that a condenser head prints sharper; Ctein thoroughly
disproved this in a test published in one of the mags several years ago. It
may give an appearance of printing sharper in light tones because the
Callier effect may increase local contrast in the lighter areas.

  Supposedly a diffusion head supresses scratches etc, but imho that's like
recommending bicycle training wheels to keep a person from falling off his
bicycle but he's actually driving a car. Who wants to print scratched negs
anyway?

  IMHO the dichro head has several advantages; they're more than sufficient
for VC printing, they're good for color printing (never say never), and
there are _plenty_ of them available, usually attached to enlargers, on the
used gear market.
  Used darkroom equipment is a buyers' market these days; it'd be feasible
to buy a used dichro enlarger, keep the head and _throw the rest away_.
That would still be far cheaper than buying a dichro or VC head brand-new.

  Hope all this helps.

  Some snipping here...

   See the tests by Dr. Richard Henry in his book _Controls in
Black-and-White Photography_ Henry tested condenser and diffusion enlargers
to see what difference there was in results. His data shows that exactly
identical results can be gotten with either type. By adjusting either
negative contrast or paper contrast the curves can be made to fall exactly
on top of each other. 
  Callier effect is a method of stating the difference in measured density
with different amounts of diffusion of the light source. The detector also
makes a difference in making density measurements. The difference in
effective density is due to scattering by the silver particles. The finer
the particles and the thinner the emulsion the less difference there is in
diffuse density and specular density. For extremely fine particles, like
the dye in color film, there is virtually no difference.
  The variation in density is exactly proportional to the density so the
variation is strictly one of contrast not curve shape.
  Most condenser enlargers are actually partially diffusing. The source is
a large, diffuse surface, light bulb. This diffuse surface is imaged on the
lens. 
  True specular sources are occasionally used for special purposes, like
microfilm, where the greatest resolution is required, but they are not very
practical for routine photography because they pick up even slight
blemishes in support and emulsion. 
  The difference in contrast between a conventional condenser enlarger,
like an Omega D2, and a diffuse source, like a cold light head or a color
head, is about one paper grade with average grain film.
  The diffuse source has the advantage of suppressing negative blemishes to
some extent. If the same negative is printed on both the higher paper grade
needed for the diffusion enlarger will tend to pick up the blemish again. 
  It can also be shown that, except for true specular sources, the
resolution of both types of sources is the same.

        Just a word about alignment tools.  If the lens stage, negative stage,
and baseboard are level then they are in alignment.  The most important thing is
that the enlarger is in alignment and rigid, and you have a good lens.  If your
enlarger is set up correctly, I not so sure that a different enlarger will make
any real difference in your finished prints.  The vcl-4500 head is over $1000
and I am sure that you will not see any difference in your print quality.
         I am in agreement with the gentleman who suggested that you look around
and invest in a good used 4x5 enlarger.  The Omega D series,  are great machines
and they have such a wide range of accessories  that it is wonderful.  I happen
to have a wall mounted Omega D3V with color head, that I love.  There is one
reason that I prefer the Beselar 45MCRX to the Omega.  It is because Beselar can
be converted to 8x10 quite easily, just by adding and 8x10 light source and
negative carrier.  For 8x10 I have finally settle on an Elwood.  I am still
looking for a Saltzman or Durst, but the Elwood will satisfy my needs for the
time being.

Now that we are talking about enlargers, maybe somebody can explain the
type of enlarger that uses lasers.  I read about it yesterday when I went
to see a show of photographs by David Fokos.  The prints were 36" by 36",
and in the accompanying statement, he said that he uses a laser enlarger
called the Light Jet 5000 to make these prints.  Supposedly this prevents
"optical spreading" when you make huge prints.  It sounds great, but it
also costs half a million dollars. I wonder if there are places where you
can sort of rent these by the hour, and if anybody on this list has done
this or knows of one in their area that they could use if they wanted.
Also, how do these enlargers work exactly?  I am having a hard time
visualizing a laser enlarger.

There is also an article about David Fokos in the May/June 2000 issue of
View Camera.

I'm pretty sure that Ivey Seright, here in Seattle, has a light jet.  It's
not the sort of thing you'd rent; the workflow is more of you bringing in a
digital file, and the service bureau printing it for you.

It's basically like a giant laser printer, except that the laser actually
prints the image directly onto the photo paper, pixel by tiny pixel (so
small you can't see them).  Everything else works just like a traditional
enlarger -> chemistry -> wash workflow.

Shannon,
The laser print, if I remenber right, is owned by a printing company.  David
uses a camera for taking his images but beyond developing the film everything
is digital.  I think he told me that the Light Jet is many thousands of
dollars.  I doudt you can rent one.

Thanks,
 I owe you one!
I had  what I think was the email/virus on my machine unopened and was
checking the list first before opening my mail. Glad I opened Tim's email

So, they expose your paper and then you take it to your darkroom and
process it?  Or they process it for you right there according to your
specifications?

They scan your film with a drum scanner into a huge file, do all the necessary corrections in photoshop and then output it to the Lightjet 5000 which is a 400 LPI laser printer which exposes color film (typically fuji crystal archive polyester) with red, green, and blue lasers. The paper is then treated to the standard chemical setup and processed. You send them your film and they scan it and return completely processed prints and the film. You can also send them (various places have these) a digital file for printing but the odds are they have a better scanner than you. This is a 100% digital process. A good drum scanner can extract a lot more information off of the film than even the best enlarger lenses, and since the paper is exposed without a lens at all, there is better edge to edge sharpness (supposedly).

If I'm not mistaken the processor is included with the LightJet, but this is 
just a guess. I think the term "laser enlarger" is a bit misleading. Seems to 
me it's more of a very high quality dedicated printer, just happens to use a 
conventional process to create the final image. The only thing it's enlarging 
is the distribution of the pixels from the scanned image.

That's not to say the images don't look incredible.

hi all.

need some opinions...I have been asked to work on a national ad 
campaign.  They want the prints to have that old look (no toners) 
from the early 1900's, with flat but washed out highlights and black 
blacks.  Almost like a print made from a bad copy neg and printed on 
matt paper (wait, that's an idea).  Any other suggestions would be 
appreciated.  Was thinking of either an old film stock or glass plate 
usually found at swap meets or even pre-fogging the film, something. 
Any ideas and/or experiences with the above mentioned ideas.

Thanks

Try shooting Kodak's Technical Pan. You should be able to determine the right 
exposure index/developing time combination to produce an effect like you 
describe. The film, depending on how it is processed, can produce a long 
tonal scale or a very short one. You should be able to get information about 
this film, and some recommended developers, through the Kodak web site.

Good luck.

  Well, of course this is not what prints from the period look like at all.
I wonder what they have been looking at, have they showed you anything as a
sample? 
  You can mash out the highlights with an overdone highlight mask but I
suspect they have been looking at prints from heavily retouched negatives,
or maybe just degraded prints.
  Ideas of what is "period" are often ludicrous.

Hey Alexis,

Bergger just introduced a paper call V.CB Style. It not on the Bergger
website as of yet.

It's a VC Warmtone 1/2 matte on an ivory tinted base. I have a freind who
beta tests and prints examples for me. It just so happens he printed an
interior of a turn of the century kitchen. He only did a slight selenium
tone, blacks were great.

Looking at the print made me feel old.

Hope this helps.

Kind Regards,

John Horowy

 The light jet printers are HUGE! they take a room of their own and need the
support of a complete chemical darkroom just as you would with normal
optical enlargers. The size and weight requires a railroad car
transportation to the sight or at least full truck.
They are about the size of a 40 inch roller transport  processor or say 4
foot high by 5 foot deep by a width that will allow for the full width { 48
inches + } of the paper and a couple of more feet on each end.
 Very massive looking machine!
 The resolution is supposed to be able to reach 8000 dpi! I have seen 90
inch lightjet prints that are very good and were made from only a 4x5
camera!
As mentioned before  they will allow for many types of photographic paper to
be used. The folks that run the one I'm familiar with are very experienced
workers at the level of Lazer scanner operators.
 They are probably the end of the silver processed commercial images.
 The Iris and lightjet processors are dinosaurs today even though they are
only a couple of years old.
   Pigment printing of some type will probably be the Near Future as the
life expectancy of many pigments is over 1000 years and going strong { oil
paintings} . Epson has a start on pigment prints with their new 2000p,
7500p, and 9500p printers. Even in this first generation of pigment printers
the quality of photographic prints and Iris prints has been  challenged.....
at  a fraction of the price for machinery. The quality is not quite as good
as the best silver prints yet but they are real close on this first wave of
printers and I'll just bet we haven't seen the tip of the iceberg yet!

One of the most significant things I learned at a printing workshop (given 
by John Sexton and Anna Larson) is the importance of controlling non-image 
light.  It doesn't matter that you have a great enlarger, perfectly 
aligned, fitted with an APO lens--if you have light leaks.  Mine weren't 
from outside (I had sealed the door well).  But my enlarger spilled light 
from every crevice and seam.  The window that shows the contrast (in a 
variable contrast head) shown like a white beacon when I put a lens cap on 
the enlarging lens.  Also my safelight wasn't--replaced the filter to fix 
that.  My, what a difference.

So before swapping enlargers, check for light leaks on the one you 
have.  Darkroom tape works on some, but you may have to construct baffles 
over the air vents and along seams.  Be sure not to cut off any air 
flow.  Write directly to me or post again if you want particulars on what 
I've done.

Hello Folks !
I think the book you spoke about has been re written and split in two
(which version I own)
The first is titled :
"Physique Photographique" by Louis Gaudart and Maurice Albert ed : "Le
temps Apprivois, 18 Rue de Cond , 75006 PARIS" ISBN 2-283-58285-7
And the other :
"Cours de Chimie Photographique" by Pierre Montel and Pierre Glafkides,
same ed, ISBN 2-283-75116-0
I've bought them one year ago, and I've seen them in a shop yesterday.
Hope I've made no mistake and are speaking of the very same book than
you Daniel ;-)
cheers

>blacks.

That sounds like the negatives I've been printing, which are from the early
thirties. These were taken by my grandfather. I think the blown out
highlights and very dark blacks are the result of taking pictures on very
bright days in bright light, and from not understanding exposure very well
or perhaps not even having a light meter, rather than because they are old.
(I have made some myself like that.)

 The "old look," as I've discovered,  includes holes in the negatives and
mold on the negatives. Some of mine also have creases where they were bent
at one time.   Some have long scratches across the whole negative.

perhaps i described the pics wrong.  the time period and quality of 
the photo's would be like the opening of the old "Cheers "TV show. 
They have existing film footage from what appears to be either before 
or after Prohibition and the prints will be placed into the footage. 
Without seeing it its hard to explain but imagine prints you might 
have seen at historical museums or old bars/restaurants that have a 
grayish cast over it but with some good blacks.  I think we are going 
to go the print/copy neg/print route as it is controllable that way. 
But if anyone has other ideas that would be great.

Thanks

Alexis

Could it be that these pictures were simply on orthochromatic film
and that much of the effect could be obtained by taking existing
color pictures and "getting the Red out"?
I think it would be far easier to experiment using digital
imaging. It would certainly be easier to change the contrast
of highlights etc.  It might be easier to add a "dirt" screen
as well.

Periodically, this list get violated with somebody's Spam like the recent:

As soon as I see it, I act to clean it up and prevent it in the future. Please
do not send me email immediately about this - give me a few days to spot it
and get rid of the problem.

This one is paricularly troublemsome because I cannot figure out how in
the heck it ever made it to the list - the sender is not subscribed to
pure-silver (or did an unsubscribe before I got to find them).  So, I
did the next best thing - I blocked the sender's email domain from sending
my server *any* mail to anyone.  This should stop these morons.

Recognize that I travel a lot and cannot get to these kinds of things
instantly.  Particularly if I am overseas, it may be several days
before I can get to pure-silver admin issues.

A good strategy (which I use) to keep your mailbox from getting too
confusing with too much oddball email, is to set up a filtering rule
which puts all pure-silver email in a separate folder rather than
letting it sit in your Inbox - then you can go back later, read
what you like and delete the rest.  This is also a way to set rules
to block email from people whom you never want to see (like me ;)) in
you email pile.

'Sorry, but there is little more that I can do.  I do not what to lose
subscribers, but there is a limit to what can be done.  I have cranked
up system security and mailing list access control as high as I can without
making the list impossibly miserable to use.  In truth, we've not had much
of this in over 5 years of operation, so an occasional incident does not bug
me too much...

Hmm... I'd be more interested in a flasher for film.

Pre-exposure flashing of film is an alternative to hypering (baking
film in a nitrogen/hydrogen atmosphere to remove moisture from the
emultion) for astrophotography.  It doesn't work the same (flashing
obviously doesn't remove moisture), but it gives similar resutls.  I
can buy pre-hyperred Tech-Pan in 35mm and 120, but not in 4x5, and I
really don't have the time to fiddle with hypering sheet film.  Maybe
a denser filter in the flasher would work well enough.

Subject: Spam Suppression On Pure-Silver


Periodically, this list get violated with somebody's Spam like the recent:

The Western Web wrote:

As soon as I see it, I act to clean it up and prevent it in the future.
Please
do not send me email immediately about this - give me a few days to spot it
and get rid of the problem.

This one is paricularly troublemsome because I cannot figure out how in
the heck it ever made it to the list - the sender is not subscribed to
pure-silver (or did an unsubscribe before I got to find them).  So, I
did the next best thing - I blocked the sender's email domain from sending
my server *any* mail to anyone.  This should stop these morons.

Recognize that I travel a lot and cannot get to these kinds of things
instantly.  Particularly if I am overseas, it may be several days
before I can get to pure-silver admin issues.

A good strategy (which I use) to keep your mailbox from getting too
confusing with too much oddball email, is to set up a filtering rule
which puts all pure-silver email in a separate folder rather than
letting it sit in your Inbox - then you can go back later, read
what you like and delete the rest.  This is also a way to set rules
to block email from people whom you never want to see (like me ;)) in
you email pile.

'Sorry, but there is little more that I can do.  I do not what to lose
subscribers, but there is a limit to what can be done.  I have cranked
up system security and mailing list access control as high as I can without
making the list impossibly miserable to use.  In truth, we've not had much
of this in over 5 years of operation, so an occasional incident does not bug
me too much...

;Hmm... I'd be more interested in a flasher for film.

We used to preflash x-ray film when I was in grad school using a cheap flash
unit with neutral density filters at a specific height above the film.  We
preflashed to increase the sensitivity of the film to low level exposure
with gamma radiation and intensifying screnes.  We determined the flash to
film distance and the amount of neutral density filtration just by flashing
a bunch of film at various distances and with various amounts of filtration
until we found that which just barely gave any density to the flashed film
and then raised the flash a little bit farther.  I've always thought one
could do the same thing,  a little more controled perhaps,  to pre-flash
film for pictorial uses if one had a need.

;Pre-exposure flashing of film is an alternative to hypering (baking
;film in a nitrogen/hydrogen atmosphere to remove moisture from the
;emultion) for astrophotography.  It doesn't work the same (flashing
;obviously doesn't remove moisture), but it gives similar resutls.  I
;can buy pre-hyperred Tech-Pan in 35mm and 120, but not in 4x5, and I
;really don't have the time to fiddle with hypering sheet film.  Maybe
;a denser filter in the flasher would work well enough.

Preflashing and gas hypersensitisation are two different animals.  In
preflash one is giving an exposure that is just below that needed to form a
latent image in the silver halide crystal.  Then low intensity light will
push the silver halide crystal over to a state that represents a latent
image (basically the accumulation of a critical amount of reduced silver
that will form a stable nucleus of silver that can act as a development
center in the presence of a developing agent).  

In gas hypersensitisation one is removing any water hydrating the emulsion
and replacing any disolved oxygen in the emulsion with a hydrogen and
nitrogen gas mixture.  The effect of this is to decrease reciprocity
failure. This allows for longer exposures with less decay of the reduced
silver so the light catalysed accumulation of reduced silver can procede to
a point where a stable nucleus has formed, thus forming the latent image.

In short,  preflashing increases the sensitivity of the film (or paper) to a
short low level exposure while gas hypersensitizing over comes reciprocity
failure to allow for long exposures.

While we are on the topic of paper flashers,  I recall seeing what I believe
to be this very unit attched to Les McLean's enlarger in an article he wrote
for a popular press magazine (Practical Photography I believe).  I think an
honest opinion of the usefulness of preflashing paper from someone who uses
the technique may be helpful to those of us that have never tried it with
printing.  Les?.....

  Grayed down highlights are caused by fogging or by oxidation of prints.
The oxidation can also cause a flattening of the highlights because of the
destruction of the silver there. Usually, however, the darker areas will
also be affected.
  Back when B&W was the mode for snapshots most photofinishers tended to
overdevelop to insure that there would be some image. The simple cameras
also tended to overexpose, especially in bright daylight. The paper used
for photofinishing was usually of a single contrast being supplied on long
rolls. A sufficiently overexposed and overdeveloped negative could give the
soot-and-whitewash effect I think you mean, however, the highlights would
not be fogged, only blown out.
  Without seeing examples of what is wanted its hard to suggest methods of
obtaining it.
  Perhaps you could get the effect of blown out highlights by using
Farmer's reducer on the print. I am not sure how to get the fogged effect,
perhaps by copying the resulting print and reprinting it with some actual
fogging. 
  Again, this is not an effect I associate with "old" photographs.
  I wonder, BTW, if part of what they want isn't the effect of early glass
plates with no anti-halation coating. These produced noticable circular
haloes around very bright objects and absolutely blew out over exposed
windows. Modern prints from these negatives are often just awful. The old
printers would mask the printer to burn in the blown out highlights since
there was some detail even in the old emulsions.

I fear spam is a fact of internet life and we just have to live with it,
and I do appreciate the effort that mailing-list administrators put in to
keep abreast of it.  So thanks Tim for your efforts :-)  

Equally though I feel that subscribers have some responsibility to read
fully the e-mails they get delivered by the list, and not simply to respond
with "remove" messages which just propagate through the list again and
annoy everyone a second time.  If the spam has appended "sent to you by
Pure-Silver" then it's the *list* that's been spammed, and it's best
ignored - replying to it will simply spam the list again!

So please - if you get spam, check to where you're sending the "remove"
message.  Or better still, ignore it completely, because once a spammer
gets a "remove" message he knows it's from a genuine email address ....  

Cheers
Richard

I may have missed a post or two so sorry if I repeat!
What you may be describing is what was common technique in inexpensive labs
for years. Small prints sometimes dupes themselves were copied with a simple
macro type setup using standard { usually PlusX}camera film of 2 1/4 or 4x5
size. The images were often no larger than the old postcard formats and
rarely larger than 2 3/4 inches by about 4 inches at most. These small
images were blown up to sometimes 40 or 50 inches and often ended up in
bars, restaurants etc. To make them "snappier" than they would normally be
{to help overcome the softness}  the copy negs were underexposed and
overdeveloped to gain high contrast and the appearance of sharper images.
 almost the opposite of good technique }.
 This will give the harshness that you describe.  On top of this they would
turn the images { sold in the thousands} into offset prints and once again
the harshness was increased!
 Several steak houses and other places are full of enlarged prints from
small images that individuals had in their scrapbooks.
 If you think this might be your "style"  you only need make small 4x5 inch
or smaller prints and copy them BADLY!  { underexpose and over develop!   A
little toning and presto black shadows and burnt out highlights.
Make the first prints higher than proper contrast and you will do even
better! One of the reasons for the original poor copies was to wash out
stains in the highlights that would normally have been removed with filters
of the same color as the stain.... or by retouching. This  trick would pass
most requirements and be quick and cheap!

Good luck,
Chuck

This thread is surely interesting and highly educative, but I think I
remember the original poster said it was for a 'national ad campaign'. I
suppose if it's a 'national ad campaign' they have a budget. So why don't
you just shoot whatever you have to shoot, get high quality drum scans of
the selection of pix, and have a competent person work them digitally to
have the result you are after, or do it yourself if you have the
computing/software power required. And bill your client.
If it's an ad done by professionals, they don't care how you do it. They
will care about the result for their client.

I should have added that the small prints when abused a little by stepping
on them etc. will then have the scratches blown up at the same time as the
final print is made and will show as very sharp and contrasty....maybe what
you want?
And avoid using copy film and do use camera film as the highlights are lost
much easier . Copy film is designed to work with the white paper base where
the standard camera film is designed to work with much brighter highlights
and looses a bit here!

No it is not the same book. The original Glafkides ( we call it "The 
Glafkides" as it is the reference ) is a thick book more than 1000 pages
ISBN 2707500437 and Paul Montel was the editor. If you find it used it
should be relatively expensive ( 150 to 250$ ) when I bought it new 24 years
ago it was also expensive (80$) . I have not seen the 2 books you are
speaking about but I believe they are part of the original.

Thanks, and i am sure you mean well, but there are still people in 
this digital age that prefer to do things the "the old fashioned 
way", to achieve a style or look, and clients who appreciate that, 
not to mention budget considerations.

I have aligned my enlarger (Beseler 23cII) using 2 mirrored tiles (btw:
price now about $6US). This seem to be a very good method, and it works
basically the same as the Versalab tool (sans laser beam-sniff, sniff).  I
have placed a felt ring on top of my negative carrier to cut down on light
leaks from the negative stage.  I made some test prints early this morning
(1am) on Kentmere VC Select.  They are sharp corner to corner and the
highlights have more detail than in the past.  Someone mentioned
split-filter printing which I hadn't done for a while, so I even made some
prints this way.  It's fun, but I end up using an extra sheet of paper when
I follow Anchell's recommendations (The Variable Contrast Printing Manual
ISBN 0-240-80259-4).  Thanks again to everyone for giving great advice!!!

I believe that readers of this list prefer to do
photographic printing the old fashioned way. 

I suspect that your client ultimately
is going to reduce your product to a computer
scan and that budget considerations actually
favor using the computer earlier on in the process.
 That's why so many very nice
used enlargers have been for sale recently. 

There is a steep learning curve, but 
I think you can go to a copymat and rent
a computer with photoshop and a scanner (maybe
a slide scanner too) for $10/hour; you might
have to grab a 12-year-old off the street
to help with the software:)

Again, thanks and i am sure your intentions are well meaning, but the 
point is being missed.  Perhaps my signature isn't showing up or 
something.  Since I do B&W printing professionally using traditional 
methods, it seems strange that I would be asked to produce something 
a certain way if all they were going to do was put it into a 
computer.  Actually what they intend to do is take my print. shoot it 
onto 35mm film stock (motion) and edit into the existing 35mm footage 
they have.  So again thanks but digital isn't what will happen.

BTW, i was recently bidding on a project and the photographer asked 
for me to send over a sample of a proprietary printing technique that 
I do.  Sure.  Well months went past ( with me calling every week to 
fine out the status of the job and to get my print back only to get 
the run around).  Finally I got the word that not only did I not get 
the job but that my print and style was used as the "match print" for 
a digital guy to do the job at twice the price. So not only did I 
lose the job to a higher bidder, my technique was stolen by a digital 
lab.

I wanted to stop spending a fortune on "dust-off" type products.

I was thinking about either

1)  a small compressor with a trigger nozzle or

2)  A large cylinder of C02 and a trigger nozzle.  I was thinking that the
C02 canister
would be quieter and be more darkroom compatible.

What do others on the list use to blow the dust off economically.

I have created a negative pressure system in the darkroom to help with
extration.

I use a scuba tank and an old regulator no longer fit for
diving.  This is about the cleanest air you will ever
find...

we use nitrogen with the trigger nozzles.  compressors can release 
moisture into the line and will get on the negatives.

IMO, for the long term an investment in a compressed nitrogen system would
probably be the most effective solution. A tank of nitrogen and a regulator
would be required, but so would a CO2 system. A manifold could be installed
to distribute the compressed nitro. The regulator should provide a low
pressure supply but I would probably used rigid copper for safety reasons
for the distribution of the gas to each individual valve. The compressed
nitro can be used to dust and evacuate air out of partially filled developer
jugs.

My 2 cents worth,

Don Bryant

Tim... how do you adjust for the small pressure and air flow required in the
darkroom?  Will the Scuba regulator go that low?

I use a scuba tank and an old regulator no longer fit for
diving.  This is about the cleanest air you will ever
find...

I guess everyone has small light leaks from their enlarger, especially
around the neg carrier "seal" or lack thereof......

SO what was the effect of the leaks in a side by side compsrison?  Dilution
of print highlights?


I have used plain old window gasket material in the past to cure this
problem... maybe I should do it again?

Clarification:  I use only the first stage of a scuba regulator - this
reduces the tank pressure from a nominal 3000psi to about 160psi or so.
Attached to the first stage (this is the part that mounts to the tank)
is a standard second stage hose.  At the other end of the hose is
a standard air blower attachment (what you see on the end of normal
compressor hoses) which can be purchased at any scuba shop.  This
give you controlled air flow and works just fine for blowing
negatives clean, cleaning out cameras, etc.

A couple points to ponder:

1) Make sure the tank you use is still inspected regularly to
   make sure you have no safety issues.  You can get a new
   80ci tank for about $150. You might even be able to find
   a used one cheap in the paper or buy it from a scuba school.

2) Make nice with your local scuba shop.  Unless you are a
   certified diver, most places will not refill tanks
   (under $5), but if you explain your use of the stuff
   to them, they'll probably accomodate you.  Also, they
   probably have old training equipment they would be
   happy to unload for small $$$ which is how I got
   a first stage for $25 which was no good for diving
   but fine for what I was doing with it. (I already had
   a really nice rig for diving and I didn't want to use
   it in this application.)

Hello every body,

    It is a question about Technical Pan 120. A which EI ( 12 to 32 ? ) do
you use it for general purposes an what is the development time in the
liquid Kodak Technidol. Many thanks

EI of 25 is optimal if you use technidol to develop it. If using Rodinal 1 
to 100 then
Techpan should be rated at 12 at the most. I have done tests and the shadow 
speed of the
film drops by at least a full stop if developing with Rodinal. The accutance 
is still very
similar and the enhanced red sensitivity is still there as well.

good luck,

John Chong

Hi Sylvia
I have just come back from a week of personal photography in wildest West
Wales, and cannot recall whether I replied to your email before I went. If
not, I apologise. I did not mean to be rude in this way.
For Delta 100, which is brilliant in DiXactol in 35mm, I use an N time of 7
minutes to print on a single condenser Leitz Focomat 1c. I'd go to 71/2
minutes for a diffuser enlarger. For N-1, I use 53/4 minutes (61/4 minutes
diffuser). For N+1, try 91/2 minutes (101/4 diffuser).
Hope that helps and that it's not too late.

Barry Thornton

Hi Barry

We have just developed a roll of FP4 plus in DiXactol and sure enough we
have very printable negatives from our 35mm film enlarging to 9x12 we
will try some more.  However I had to use some of this modern stuff
recently, Delta 100 as it was all I could get at the time, I have read
the past emails looking for the time to develop Delta 100, my question
is how long should this be in the developer for?

Richard Ross's flashing device is an absolute 'must'. You wonder how you
ever managed without one once you have one in the darkroom. I simply put
some Velcro on the back of the flasher head, and on the lens caps of all my
enlargers. The flasher is mounted in a moment centred over the print. With
hands-free operation like this you can dodge the flashing exposure too if
you want only to flash part of the paper.
You can also flash over the developing dish for some interesting effects.
To preflash film, it isn't necessary to go to al sorts of trouble setting up
special rigs in the darkroom - especially with electronic flash units which
are far from reliable in the consistency of their light output. The answer
is very simple - preflash in camera whenever you need preflashed film. Take
a meter reading through a diffuser in the same direction that the camera is
pointing. Transfer this reading to the camera and place the diffuser over
the camera lens. Close down as many stops as you need to achieve the
preflash you need on film. Preflashing at zone II is the most that can be
done without too noticeable an affect in my experience. It's really easy
this way - a matter of a few moments. The diffuser can be a disc of opal
glass but a couple of thicknesses of white shopping carrier bags common over
here in the UK work just as well.
Not only does the preflash increase film speed, it's a great way to boost
shadow detail in high contrast scenes.

;Hmm... I'd be more interested in a flasher for film.

We used to preflash x-ray film when I was in grad school using a cheap flash
unit with neutral density filters at a specific height above the film.  We
preflashed to increase the sensitivity of the film to low level exposure
with gamma radiation and intensifying screnes.  We determined the flash to
film distance and the amount of neutral density filtration just by flashing
a bunch of film at various distances and with various amounts of filtration
until we found that which just barely gave any density to the flashed film
and then raised the flash a little bit farther.  I've always thought one
could do the same thing,  a little more controled perhaps,  to pre-flash
film for pictorial uses if one had a need.

;Pre-exposure flashing of film is an alternative to hypering (baking
;film in a nitrogen/hydrogen atmosphere to remove moisture from the
;emultion) for astrophotography.  It doesn't work the same (flashing
;obviously doesn't remove moisture), but it gives similar resutls.  I
;can buy pre-hyperred Tech-Pan in 35mm and 120, but not in 4x5, and I
;really don't have the time to fiddle with hypering sheet film.  Maybe
;a denser filter in the flasher would work well enough.

Preflashing and gas hypersensitisation are two different animals.  In
preflash one is giving an exposure that is just below that needed to form a
latent image in the silver halide crystal.  Then low intensity light will
push the silver halide crystal over to a state that represents a latent
image (basically the accumulation of a critical amount of reduced silver
that will form a stable nucleus of silver that can act as a development
center in the presence of a developing agent).

In gas hypersensitisation one is removing any water hydrating the emulsion
and replacing any disolved oxygen in the emulsion with a hydrogen and
nitrogen gas mixture.  The effect of this is to decrease reciprocity
failure. This allows for longer exposures with less decay of the reduced
silver so the light catalysed accumulation of reduced silver can procede to
a point where a stable nucleus has formed, thus forming the latent image.

In short,  preflashing increases the sensitivity of the film (or paper) to a
short low level exposure while gas hypersensitizing over comes reciprocity
failure to allow for long exposures.

While we are on the topic of paper flashers,  I recall seeing what I believe
to be this very unit attched to Les McLean's enlarger in an article he wrote
for a popular press magazine (Practical Photography I believe).  I think an
honest opinion of the usefulness of preflashing paper from someone who uses
the technique may be helpful to those of us that have never tried it with
printing.  Les?.....

Barry and Richard,

So why couldn't one use a low wattage bulb driven by an electronic timer?
Is there a "feedback loop" to insure a constant and repeatable output or
something of that sort.

Daniel,
Tech-pan is a very fine film for general purpose use but there are several
very important points to consider before using it.

The effective speed of Tech-Pan varies according to the kind of light you
are shooting in. It has an extended red sensitivity and gains speed when the
red proportion of white light increases- as at dusk or early morning. I have
found the difference to be as much as one stop. I rate the film at 50 asa
for these times or at 18-25 asa for late morning to mid afternoon use. If
you are shooting in shadows, where there is a larger amount of blue light
the speed falls even further.

Contrast in the subject can be a problem with this film as the highlights
readily burn out if even slightly overexposed and compensating in the
development will not always rectify the situation. I have found the best
commercial developer to be Technidol, but am working on some variations as
found in the Film Developing Cookbook by Anchell and Troop. Shadow details
is readily preserved, though, with a minimum printable density of  0.01
above base fog. The negs should therefore appear much thinner than negs from
a conventional film such as Pan-F to print successfully.

One other point about Technidol. I found that the agitation is very
important with this film but I don't use Kodaks recommendations (which can
lead to hernias!)
I agitate continuously for the first 30 secs then gently swirl the tank in
alternate clockwise and counterclockwise directions every 30 secs for the
rest of the dev. time.(thanks to Fritz!). This appears to give a reasonably
compensating effect and helps avoid totally burnt out highlights. It's
important to always use a stop bath and to keep all the subsequent solutions
at around the same temperature, as the film will easily shock with radical
temp. changes. It's perhaps best to have the stop 1 deg. lower than the dev.
and the fix 2 degs. lower than the stop as the wash will usually be 3-5
degrees cooler than the dev.(if you follow).  Dev. time for me is 6.5 mins
at 20 deg.C- much less and you will start getting signs of underdevelopment
in that the film will take on that 'lith film developed in ID-11' look,
which will give very flat prints.

The only way to use this film is to experiment wildly- and be creative.!!!

Best wishes,

Julian Smart.

A couple of years ago, I read a similar comment, mentally noted it - but did 
nothing.  A few days later, I exposed a sheet of paper in the easel, upside 
down (and not the first time, either).  When I  noticed this in the 
developer, I restrained my usual impulse to "rip it out" of the developer and 
throw it away.  I let it develop to completion.  There was a LOT of image 
there, on a standard DW FB paper.  Although the light had to make only one 
pass through the paper to reach the emulsion, I wondered if - properly 
positioned and exposed - the emulsion would prevent the light from passing 
through, reflecting from the white easel surface back up to the underside of 
the emulsion, and confounding the exposure somewhat.

I didn't know the answer, but I immediately sprayed all of my easels, etc., 
with a flat-black paint.  Now, I can sleep easier at night.

dear group

free web space is available for guest photographers within my website. This
gains upwards of 100,000 visitors a week.
Visit http://www.cjballphotography.co.uk to see if you shape up.

I am also interested in any photographic formulae, tutorials, reviews etc.
In fact anything that pertains to fine arts photography and photographic
education.
send me ideas suggestions. Can you think on how I could improve my site ?
please let me know

All the best to all photographers, the proponents of the most democratic of
artforms

Take care

There is a new flashing device on the market called the Dauxlite II. It 
is available at  Pro Photo Supply in Portland,Or. and comes from a local 
designer of photography products. I don't know much about it but it is a 
handheld unit that uses LEDs for it's output and involves multigrade 
filtration as well.....

  I am another who paints easels flat black. I've never tested this but it
woudl be interesting to make a couple of prints with half the paper on a
flat black surface and half on a white surface and see whether there is a
visible difference.

Daniel, The Photographers' Formulary has a TD3 developer which worked great
for tech pan enlarged positives that I used for making platinum negatives.  It
has a range of contrast and is controlled by part A to part B.

i also have used HC110 at 1:15 to 1:20 rated at 50.  It works great for
copying negatives to make quick slides as well.  Technidol works great but it
is expensive for my taste.

  FWIW I just did a test with Anchell & Troop's TDLC-103.

  Developed 10'/68F with ordinary intermittent agitation, EI is 12 for
.10DU above fb&f for Zone I, short toe, fairly straight line out to Zone
VII, then beginning to shoulder off until the curve goes essentially flat
(blocked) past Zone X. D-Max is 1.60 at Zone XI.

  This is pretty much the "standard" TP curve shape.

  You might try Ethol TEC 1:15, 5'30"/70F intermittent agitation, EI 50(!),
with the same curve shape.

Hi,

Has anyone tried Kodak High Speed Infrared in DiXactol? Perhaps Barry
could comment on the suitability of this film-developer combination. I
ask because I understand that KHSI works very well with pyro - and I'd
like to try a similar "staining" developer that is rather less toxic!

Thanks

Guy

You could, and in fact this is more or less exactly what the PaperFlasher
comprises!  Most of the problems we had during development of the product
centred on getting a sufficiently even light output.  Also, the power to
the bulb is electronically regulated for consistency.

Richard

Interesting!  LEDs were the first source we tried but it proved impossible
to get a sufficiently even spread of light without "hot spots".  Multigrade
filtration is a moot point - as discussed a while ago on the list it
doesn't have a lot of effect, except that flashing at a hard filtration
doesn't work as effectively as white light or soft filtration.

I'll let Richard reply about the feedback loop.
The flasher has a timer to 0.1 second. It is quickly and conveniently moved
to where you want it. I guess it effectively is a low wattage bulb (LED I
think) driven by an electronic timer.

Barry and Richard,

So why couldn't one use a low wattage bulb driven by an electronic timer?
Is there a "feedback loop" to insure a constant and repeatable output or
something of that sort.

I carried out tests on this many years ago with double weight paper. There
was no discernible difference between black or white base boards on the
resulting print.
However, to give ease of viewing/focusing, and to be actinicly safe, use an
orange or deep yellow base board or easel. They look pretty well white under
safelighting anyway.
With light spill from enlargers being so difficult to prevent completely, I
do paint the walls immediately around the enlarger mat black, but it is
surprising how much light is reflected from clothes when we stand in front
of the enlarger wearing white or light colours. I have some 'safelight red'
shirts which I wear for the purpose. One day, maybe, they will come back
into fashion again!

Has anyone tried Kodak High Speed Infrared in DiXactol? Perhaps Barry
could comment on the suitability of this film-developer combination. I
ask because I understand that KHSI works very well with pyro - and I'd
like to try a similar "staining" developer that is rather less toxic!

Thanks

DiXactol will work with Kodak IR, but I just can't see why you would want
to. The whole point of DiXactol is to give ultra sharp results via edge
effects and to control halation, the very opposite of what you get with IR
film! But if you insist, you can use the combination.
There is pretty high base fog but nothing that can't be printed through. Use
the single bath option for around 10 minutes at 21C depending on your
enlarger and printing paper. Try it printed on a graded paper rather than a
VC to start with.

I can confirm that there is no advantage at all in using VC hard filtration
while flashing with Richard's flasher, and hardly any advantage in soft
filtration. The gain in paper response is pretty well cancelled out by the
cut-down in light output by the filter. But if you want to do it, it's a
cinch to place a filter gel over the flasher's head.

Interesting!  LEDs were the first source we tried but it proved impossible
to get a sufficiently even spread of light without "hot spots".  Multigrade
filtration is a moot point - as discussed a while ago on the list it
doesn't have a lot of effect, except that flashing at a hard filtration
doesn't work as effectively as white light or soft filtration.

I carried out tests on this many years ago with double weight paper. There
was no discernible difference between black or white base boards on the
resulting print.
However, to give ease of viewing/focusing, and to be actinicly safe, use an
orange or deep yellow base board or easel. They look pretty well white unde=
r
safelighting anyway.
With light spill from enlargers being so difficult to prevent completely, I
do paint the walls immediately around the enlarger mat black, but it is
surprising how much light is reflected from clothes when we stand in front
of the enlarger wearing white or light colours. I have some 'safelight red'
shirts which I wear for the purpose. One day, maybe, they will come back
into fashion again!

As a side note to the easel reflectance thread I wanted to mention that  I
worked in an Aerial Photo darkroom that had a Log-E-Tronics contact printer.
This printer has a slit shutter with small openings that "scans" back and
forth exposing the paper by slowing down on dense parts and speeding up
where thin neg was encountered. The exposure was read through the back of
the paper. The easel was clear glass with the sensor {Video head} below the
paper. There was a large amount of light coming through the paper when you
looked through the bottom with sides open.
  My guess is that the reflected light might have an effect on conventional
easels. I'm trying now to remember if I have ever { or should I say in my
memory :o) } exposed two sheets of paper at once by accident and then
developed them to see how strongly the bottom sheet was exposed. I seem to
remember that I did this with Agfa #6 single weight and the prints didn't
separate until in the developer ... If memory serves me there was a slight
image on the bottom sheet so the possibility of problems may exist. I think
Richards way of testing with different areas of black and white paper
underneath would take into affect the threshold effect in testing. Would
this not show in a contrast increase as the low light values would be
absorbed and not reflected enough to affect the print highlight area but the
light from the neg's shadows would have enough energy to pass back through
affecting those areas?
I would be curious to know if anyone tries this in the next week as I can't
print for a few days or so unless someone wants to help move the hotwater
heater and sink drains....for the third time   :o)

Unfortunately this is unlikely to work for astrophotography.  The
subject is a (hopefully) dark sky and star field and I don't think it
will register on a meter.  If I could get a meter reading I'd probably
need an in camera preflash of a couple of minutes.

For roll film I can buy hypered Tech Pan, so I probably wouldn't
bother with preflashing it.  For sheet film I was thinking of
preflashing in the darkroom (although the time between preflash and
exposure would probably be too long), or building a box to attach a
film holder and a light source with ND filters.

Why do you say modern electronic flashes are inconsistent?  I would
assume that if I set the flash on manual and made sure to let it fully
charge that I would get consistent light levels.

Hi Brian
I take your point about flashing using the night-time sky!
No reason why you shouldn't do it in advance in daytime however. The point
is that a camera is the device designed and made to expose film to
controlled amounts of light. No need to construct it all over again in the
darkroom.
According to a number of tests I have seen of professional flash units over
the years, including one just a couple of months ago, we cannot rely on a
fully charged flash unit on manual giving the same light output
consistently. I have not conducted tests myself - indeed these days I barely
ever use flash - so cannot speak with recent personal experience and
certainty. I did try to out a couple of amateur flash units in this way for
Zone system film speed tests about 10 years ago to see whether it would
provide valid results and avoid the need for bright overcast shadowless
outdoor lighting for this process. I didn't find I was getting consistent
results.
I guess that camera/flash systems where the camera quenches the flash by
reading light received at the film plane would be very consistent, but I
don't think that is what you had in mind.

I have tried this test on double weight fibre paper making identical
exposures on identical paper with white/black under the respective sheets of
paper, then processed together. Even with the most nit-picking scrutiny
afterwards, I could see no difference. As I said before, if you are still
uneasy about this, don't use user-unfriendly mat black easels, use a
non-actinic colour like orange. Don't Saunders use yellow?

Hi Barry Yes you did send us a reply thanks very much.  Hope that Wales was
not too wild, and the photography was awesome.
We have just had to replace our tired laptop computer computer it must have
gone past its 20 million key depressions as the key pad ceased up, we are
trying to find our way around a new Mac after years of the PC world.  I could
be in danger of testing some digital imaging.

Thanks again for the information the negatives look great from the roll of
Delta 100.

Thanks.  Your reply finally turned on the light in my head and it
occurs to me that I can point any camera (not just the camera used to
take the astro photo) at a featureless wall (focussed at infinity) and
make the pre-exposure flash.

I was under the impression that the main cause of long exposure
reciprocity failure was energy leaking from crystals that hadn't been
hit by enough photons quickly enough to push them to the fully "on"
state.  Given this, the purpose of flashing is to elevate the entire
piece of film to just below the fully "on" state so that the low rate
of photons striking the film during a long astrophotography exposure
(five to ten minutes, longer if you are under really dark skies and
can guide that long) is enough to leave a lasting image that won't
leak away during the exposure.

Assuming the above is true, I figured that flashing the film just
before the main exposure would give the best results.  With too long a
delay I assumed the pre-flash exposure would have time to leak away
itself.  I guess that doing it the same day should be good enough.

Of course the thing to do is try it and see what happens.  Why
couldn't I think of these nifty science fair projects when I was in
school?  :)

I'm expecting a new telescope to arrive in August, which means that
I'm also expecting at least another month of cloudy nights.  :)

Thanks for the advice! This is an academic exercise for me as  all of my
easels are already yellow or dark enough to not worry. I just use the back
of a reject print for composing and focusing.
I print mostly large stuff and had to make my own.{ ever priced a 30x40 inch
easel? :o) }

Hello !
If I do understand you well, you've to duplicate the look of early
century picts.
May I do a remark ? Film at that period was not "Panchromatic" I think
(Mr Knoppow, help !)
So I think that the washed out highlights were from lack of blue
sensitivity.
Why do not try Ortho film ?
Hope this will help a bit !

If you could at some time update us with the results of your trials, I, and
I am sure the rest of the pure-silver community, would be most interested.

  I'm not sure ortho film is responsible for this look. Around 1900 most
film was still "color blind" meaning sensitive to blue and UV light. This
is the fundamental sensitivity of silver halides. Pictures taken with color
blind, or "ordinary" film have an odd tone rendition due to the lack of
color sensitivity but the gray scale rendition purely due to brightness can
be very good. 
  Orthochramtic films are sensitized to green and, for some types, also
yellow, by the addition of certain dyes to the emulsion. I am not sure of
the date of introduction of ortho film but it must have been available not
long after 1900. It has a considerably better rendition of the gray scale
equivalents of color, particularly human skin, although it still reproduces
red as black. Panchromatic film is sensitized into the red, also by the
addition of a dye or dyes to the emulsion. Pan film was introduced as early
as 1905 but did not become popular until the late 1920's. It had a
reputation for being soft in contrast and grainy compared to the ortho
films of the day. 
  When news photographers used flash bulbs as a primary light source ortho
film was preferred since its lack of red sensitivity yielded somewhat more
detail in faces, which tended to be washed out by the flash-on-the-camera
technique.
  Pan film became more popular as it was improved and began to displace
ortho film for most uses by the late 1920's. The motion picture industry
was forced to use pan film by the changes in lighting caused by the
introduction of sound. Use of daylight was precluded by the necessity of
closed, sound proofed, stages, and arc lights were too noisy, both
mechanically and electrically. So incandescent lighting had to be used and
ortho film was just too slow.
  Whatever advantage ortho film might have had was eliminated by the
discovery of gold sensitizing by Agfa around 1935. Ortho films continued to
be popular for many uses until the 1960's but its market was slowly eroded
so that there are no longer any ortho films on the market intended for
pictorial use. 
  Very old images sometimes have blown out highlights due to halation. This
was an especial problem for plate negatives which did not have a back
coating. The familiar effect of completely detailess windows in interior
photographs of old factories (for example) is mainly due to this effect.
There is often actually detail there but it takes careful burning in during
printing to make it visible.
  There are so many really old photographs with really fine tonal rendition
that I think the effect described is not due to film or printing, but
rather to degradation of prints over a long time.

Returning from holiday I have a backlog of pure-silver to catch up on, so
please forgive my late comments.


Richard Ross, Re: F-stop printing 06/07/2000 wrote, "The most confusing
thing about F-stop printing is the name".  But is it really confusing?  If
you think in terms of 'F-stop equivalents'; the print exposure increase or
decrease needed to achieve the same change in print density is equivalent to
a change in aperture, I think the meaning is clear.  After reading Gene
Nocon's book (1987) I enthusiastically took to F-stop printing. I use a
Baeuerle timer, which permits times to one tenth of a second, and a wall
chart beside my enlarger gives the F-Stop equivalents and a very simple
means of finding the exposure for a change of enlargement size.  The
attachment shows the chart for those interested. I think it
self-explanatory. It is based on an assumed exposure for a working print
with a 10" base, of 10 seconds. If for example the actual exposure at lens
aperture of f11 is 14 seconds, (a half F-stop equivalent more) then the same
difference is applied to the indicated exposure of the new enlargement size,
so a 20" base print would need 56 seconds at the same lens aperture, or 28
seconds at f8.  Please Richard do not introduce the new name of Talbots. In
any case it would only be fair to call them Nocons, or Tim Rudman after the
popularisers of the method if you must go this way :-)

Eric Boutilier-Brown wrote about Film Drying 10/07/2000.  Dictionary of
Photography (Illife)  suggest 2 or 3 minutes in methylated spirits, not
stronger than 80%.  I have not found this very satisfactory, due possibly to
impurities found in the meths kept by hardware stores.  Much better, and a
method I use when rapid-drying short lengths of copy or lith 35mm film, is a
mix of 3 parts petroleum ether and 1 part diacetone alcohol.  The  water
diffuses to the bottom of the tank (stainless steel) and thus cannot
contaminate the film when removed. The film dries very quickly. Do not on
any account smoke or bring a flame near this mixture - It is very very
inflammable.

Then perhaps the answer is wet plate? Blown out high lights is easy with that.

Good luck

    Hi all
well, I think the most different thing from modern prints to old ones is the
printing medium, because differences in the negative are not so visible because
they used big negatives and developed by inspection, then a good print
carefully made and processed can look quite good even today, most differences
come from the type of film (blue sensitive) and print paper (salted paper,
albumen paper, carbon prints, bromoil....etc...), I tell you:
    - THE NEGATIVES were not pancromatic, just blue sensitive (called ordinary
plate) or orthocromatic, often the ortho film was used with a red filter (with
greater exposures) to obtain a more panchromatic effect. Plates were developed
by inspection and contact printed, then a more or less contrasty negative was
created, because contact printing in old papers nedded a full tonal rendition
in a contrasty negative, the negs had no exposure latitude, this was corrected
when developing under the red light. Also a blue sky in a blue sensitive plate
is absolutely burned out and like in modern slides when a neg is developed to
its full contrast detail disapears ( specially with old developers)
.Solution... use a normal film with a blue filter, develop to a greater time to
obtain more contrast, you can use as sugested technical pan, but you can use
anything developed in rodinal to a extended time. You can also photograph in a
normal film with a blue filter, then develop normally and make big negatives in
the darkroom proyecting with the enlarger on ortho film and develop by
inspection, then use the negs for  contact printing.
    - THE PRINTS were made on ancient materials, you can do your own old
material with some chemicals bought in specialiced stores, for example salted
paper is just a cotton paper soaked in salted water, then painted with a silver
nitrate solution (corrosive!!!), then dryed in a dark place, and finally
contact printed in the sun and fixed in sodium sulfide when finished. It is
very easy to do, if you do it this way prints will not be very stable but a
longer process can be done if you want the prints to last a century, color and
texture will make the prints to look like drawings, really beautifull. Other
processes as carbon printing, albumen papers and cyanotypes or even bromoil
prints are more complicated, but ready made kits are sold. Printing in 19th
century processes will make photos look really old, and you can also use an
acetate photocopy as a contact negative (or scaned photos printed in acetate
paper).

    You can ask me more if you want from old methods or buy a book.

 I have noted that several times in Westons writing he mentions
vigorous or strong negatives. Is this just his terminology for
contrasty or does it have a deeper meaning related to
density/contrast/tone placement?
 TIA

  This seems to be pretty common parlance in old photo books. Negatives are
described as "vigorous" or "brilliant", which I interpret as meaning they
don't print flat.
  Even though Lloyd A. Jones of Kodak Labs published his first exposition
on tonal reproduction in 1920 the relationship between negative contrast
and development, and printing qualities doesn't seem to have been well
understood generally. Jones paper was published in the _Journal of the
Franklin Institute_, a well respected, peer-reviewed, scientific journal.
It probably didn't have much currency. 
  I am afraid that most photographers of the twenties and thirties had very
little understanding of some very fundamental relationships in photography,
they certainly don't show up in early books.

You might check with Michael A. Smith about this one. He is knowledgable on
Weston printing & developing methods and follows the same basic path himself
with excellent results. Check at  http://www.michaelandpaula.com  and I
think it will get you to his webpage.

At least two years ago I was using PMK  for some 8x10 HP5 negs I was working
on. I purchased some new darkroom materials and along with them I picked up
some of the premixed PMK from Photographers Formulary. Some how the batch of
PMK that I was using got into a box that was supposed to be put in the back
of my chemistry cabinet but instead went to an outdoor storage room.  A
cpouple of days later after a hour or two search I went ahead and used the
new batch from Photographers F. and forgot about the old PMK batch. This
already half used PMK was stored until recently in an unheated and
unairconditioned room in an area that stayed below freezing for long periods
and was also subjected to "Deep South" summer temps for at least two
summers.
Since I just found it I decided to try it to see if it was any good at all.
I keep a supply of test negs to run to test the developers {partly Xtol
related ..:o) } before making any neg runs and had previously tested PMK
very closely .
To my surprise the "old" half used and temperature abused developer checks
out almost exactly the same as a fresh batch!
I just thought that this was remarkable enough to mention!
Well at least I'm impressed! :o)

Thanks for the replies!
 I started processing in the 60's but never really tried many of the old
papers or films earlier than TriX or Kodabromide vintage.
 Just was not sure if the "Vigorous" negs were needed for paper of Weston's
day or if it was just a common way of expressing the results such as the
term "snappy" is used today.

I'm looking for an easy to follow calotype recipe - hopefully by tomorrow so 
I have time to order in chemicals. Short notice I know. It's for a class 
workshop, and I need something that tertiary students can follow easily.

Any recipes or links to webpages would be greatly appreciated. All I've 
found a very vague instructions, and 'Keepers of Light' is out of our 
library at the moment.

Thanks
