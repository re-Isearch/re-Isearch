I am used to using self-mixed PMK well over a year old from part full brown
glass bottles with just the same sort of result you are getting. In fact, I
have never been able to leave PMK long enough for it to 'die' before I have
used it up. It's in the Rodinal league for longevity.

I myself use a variant of PMK, called ABC+ ( aka " Rollo Pyro" marketed
by B&S) formulated by Herald Leban from Austria. His formula calls for
more pyro and metol, and Vit.C as anti-oxidant. This formula is less
stable at room temperature (about a year, I keep it in the fridge right
now). When freshly brewn it has to ripen for about a week or so as I
found out in the hard way.

Oh, this formula is specially ment for rotation development such as in a
JOBO,

I'm trying it out now along with Barry's DiXatol!
 I've got a drying cabinet full of test negs now waiting for me to test
print as soon as they dry { slow in our recent 100% humidity spell.}
 I've been itching to try the Rollo version as it is pretty close to the
type I used years ago when I was in school. I gave it up by the early 70's
due to random failures..... mostly mine I'm sure!
The literature gives me reason to believe that many of the problems are
worked out and I'm very much stuck on using my Jobo with the 3000 series
drums.
I mostly shoot 8x10 so the developers don't last long enough to have aging
problems unless I goof and send them to "storage'.  :o)

..well I use the 2501 (?) Jobo tank with a 4*5 inch spiral: I load 4
sheets on it, and process in only 300 ml (4 ml ABC+ + 16 ml SMB (half
strength stock, can't get the full strength stuff in solution) + 300
ml). So a small stock lasts long!

Barry the formula for ABC+:

Part A

                 Distilled water                 	800 ml
                 Sodium Bisulfite                        20 gm
                 Metol                                   20 gm
                 Pyrogallic Acid                 	150 gm
                 Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C)       	10 gm

Hi Cor.
Do you have any guidelines for using ABC+?
It'd be great if you did.
Many thanks

This is the reason that I wanted to try the Rollo Pyro version. I need two
liters of PMK working solution to develop 5 8x10 sheets in PMK!  I use the
first 1000 ml for half the time and then a fresh 1000 ml for the second half
of developing time {recommended to prevent aerial oxidation}. Works great
but is wasteful. { this has been my standard for several years.... well
since Gordon put out his Pyro book   :o)  }  I have never had the great
highlight suppression that I was looking for but do get absolutely
repeatable results good stain and better shadow speed than standard MQ
developers or my other favorite developers. Zone development has been right
on what Gordon H. has in his book except that I standardized on 24C/75F
degrees.
 So far the Rollo Pyro has slightly less shadow speed and about the same
stain as far as measured on the densitometer. I haven't had the chance to
compare the prints yet but will by weeks end. I' m working on Barry's
DiXactol right now and will be checking all three against Xtol and other MQ
developers { also the P. Formulary D23}. This is the first chance I've had
to re-run my zone test on a large group of negs in a while.
Forgot how much fun pure experimenting was! { and I don't have to spot
prints either!  :o) }

I wonder if anybody has any experience with Neopan 400 35mm in DiXactol?
How does it take the stain, etc

I have had great results with HP5+ in 220 and Paterson 200 in 35mm, but have
a few rolls of Neopan I'd like to try

Regards from showery old London

..sure, most of it is derived from an article from Carl Weese in one of
last years issues of Photo Techniques. The idea is that you can use Pyro
negatives both for silver gelatine and alt. photo processes; the yellow
stain acts as added density under UV. Normally negatives or alt.
processes are (too) dense to process as "normal" silver gelatine prints;
it works quite nice;

My figures (YMMV): processing at 22degC in a JOBO CPE2, 2501 drum

FP4 plus (ARISTA 125): 4ml A + 16 ml B + 300 ml water for 8 minutes
HP5 plus (ARISTA 400): 6ml A + 24 ml B + 300 ml water for 6.5 minutes

Note that I use a half strength stock B (the sodium meta borate)


Good luck,

Cor

Almost out of habbit I use APX400 as my "standard"film for MF (..it is
cheaper than Kodak..;-)..), I use it mainly in my Fuiji 645 rangefinder
camera. 
I do produce (some) nice negatives with this combo, but quite a few
images lack the sharpness I want. I tend to use 1/125 -1/250
shutterspeed, so the main cause can be me: mybe I am not that good in
focusing with a range finder (had the rangefinder checked, it was ok).
Use the same film with my 6*6 Bronica in the studio, also here got some
sharpness problems.

This intro leads to the following question: recently a dutch
fotomagazine ran a article compairing different B&W films. If I recall
correctly they claimed that the AGFA film is not very good at resolving
details..say a "less sharp" film than Tmax400..

I am not sure if this is tue, so I would like to hear some opnions about
APX400 (I rate it at 250 asa, process in Xtol) versus Tmax400 (which I
use for 35mm only, rate at 320 asa soup in Xtol).

Oh..I do wear glasses, but when using my manual 35mm or my 4*5 inch
camera I do not have sharpness/focussing problems,

thanks,
Cor

Hi all,

I've just got some Xtol, having read good things about it, to use with
Ilford Delta 100 and 400.
The artticle suggested a small speed increase was obtained (1/2 stop -100,
2/3 stop - 400), but I'd be interested to know what others think or have
found.

Regards,   John

Given what you have said and your experience with images that are regularly
less than sharp, why not just buy a few rolls of other films and do a direct
comparison. Using a film that gives substandard results in an attempt to
save a few pennies per roll is not a saving of any kind, it is an expensive
waste.

..that is exactly what I will do now, but somehow I find it hard to
believe that AGFA's APX400 is an inferior film, but if my tests prove
it, I obviously dump the the rest of my AGFA stock..

Carl also goes on to say, in his and Sullivan's book, that if you want the
best results for either silver printing or for an alt process, you have to
develop accordingly.  For a Pt print you need to aim for a much denser,
contrastier print (maxing out at about 1.8) than for silver.  For straight
Pd you need even more contrast tthan that (about 2.1).  Negatives need much
longer development times for Pt/Pd, because of the greater tonal range
available than with silver prints.  Using pyro developer may allow you to
"get away with" using a negative originally developed for a silver-based
process for contact printing, but you will not get the best possible
results.  For that, you need to develop the negs with much higher density
in the highlight regions.

  Xtol 1:1 9'30"/70F is a good starting point. Actually Delta 400 could
probably use a minute more but I've never tested that.

  A few tidbits....

  Two tests gave me EI 125 for Delta 100 in Xtol 1:1, so I think that's
valid, but I just go ahead and shoot it at EI 100 to move shadow detail up
off the toe a tad more. Delta 100 has slightly decreased shadow contrast,
while Delta 400 has a fairly straight-line curve shape. EI 400 for Delta 400.
  You certainly won't hurt anything by exposing a little more; that's
largely a matter of taste. I use .10 DU above fb&f at Zone I for the
speedoint.

  Delta 400 has slightly reduced red sensitivity compared to the more
traditional films we're used to; caucasian skin tones may appear a little
dark. Delta 100 doesn't share that trait.

  Unlike many developers, Xtol gives its _slowest_ speed with no dilution.
Diluting to 1:1 usually gives at least a 1/3 stop higher EI.

  The Delta films will retain a magenta dye color after processing if a
wash aid isn't used; this is of no consequence but if you don't want
slightly magenta negs, use a wash aid. You can use the store-bought kind or
make you own by dissolving a tablespoon of sodium sulfite in a quart of
water; after fixing, give the film a couple of minutes in the wash aid,
then wash.

  Also, the Delta films need about 1/3 more fix time than traditional films.

Yes and No!  :o)
I will be glad to!.....but I just _today_ found that my time has been
hijacked AGAIN !!!!!!!
 I now have more photo work than I can handle for at least a month but will
be back at it again hopefully before long! I can't complain as I'm trying to
make a living in photography but I sure did want to update things a bit
before the summer was over! { Fall is my favorite season to shoot as the fog
and mist start rolling in around here! }
 I also would enjoy any new info that others have gathered on the
differences in the types of Pyro and also Barry's DiXactol developer. One of
the things I'm interested in is the use of the above developers on Tmax 100
as I'm trying to switch to the 4x5 and Readyloads for backpacking....due to
the ...uh....age thing.    :o)

Good Light to all,
Chuck

It's not as good as HP5+ for stain, but nothing else is either!. You will
find it about average. The grain on 35mm is a little better than HP5+, but
can still be a little too prominent. Try Delta 100 in 35mm - it's great in
DiXactol even if you sacrifice some speed. It is, though, a genuine EI 100.
No need to cut speed as you would have to in other developers.

Subject: AGFA APX400 versus Tmax400


Almost out of habbit I use APX400 as my "standard"film for MF (..it is
cheaper than Kodak..;-)..), I use it mainly in my Fuiji 645 rangefinder
camera.
I do produce (some) nice negatives with this combo, but quite a few
images lack the sharpness I want. I tend to use 1/125 -1/250
shutterspeed, so the main cause can be me: mybe I am not that good in
focusing with a range finder (had the rangefinder checked, it was ok).
Use the same film with my 6*6 Bronica in the studio, also here got some
sharpness problems.

This intro leads to the following question: recently a dutch
fotomagazine ran a article compairing different B&W films. If I recall
correctly they claimed that the AGFA film is not very good at resolving
details..say a "less sharp" film than Tmax400..

I am not sure if this is tue, so I would like to hear some opnions about
APX400 (I rate it at 250 asa, process in Xtol) versus Tmax400 (which I
use for 35mm only, rate at 320 asa soup in Xtol).

Oh..I do wear glasses, but when using my manual 35mm or my 4*5 inch
camera I do not have sharpness/focussing problems,

Cor
For some years about 7 years ago I processed film for a London photographer
who insisted on using the old Agfa AP400 in 35mm, which I knew to be more
grainy than Tri-X or HP5. He specified Rodinal developer. The first time he
ordered, I called him before processing to tell him that the film was pretty
grainy, and that Rodinal tended to produce grain like sandpaper. Together,
they would be lacking in resolution. He insisted. With a sigh, I followed
his instructions. How wrong I was! The negatives produced really sharp
prints with particularly rich tonality.
Later when APX 400 emerged, he switched to that, and again Rodinal gave
lovely tones, very crisp sharpness and even finer grain. I have never been
able to get results like this with any other developer with this film. It is
just one of those lovely combinations.
Your email raised one of those perennial misunderstandings in photography.
It mentioned resolution and related this to sharpness. There is little
connection! There is no doubt that T-Max 400 is finer grain than APX 400,
and this does help to raise resolution levels. However, this has no bearing
on acutance, and it is quite usual for a coarser grain film to look sharper
than a fine grain one. Indeed people using Tech Pan, for instance, for the
ultimate fine grain in search of apparent sharpness are quite likely to be
disappointed. It is a fact that a little visible grain makes the image look
sharper than a perfectly smooth rendition. Also edge effects in development
raise the appearance of sharpness greatly. My experience has been that
conventional grain films respond more to edge effect enhancement through
development than tabular grain films.
And so to Xtol. I keep reading about how this developer is sharper than
conventional MQ developers. Sorry, not in my use it isn't. It may give
slightly finer grain, and thus slightly higher resolution, but it just
doesn't look sharp! I have seen printed comparisons in magazines which
purport to confirm this improved sharpness. They show comparative giant
enlargements of a tiny section of the negative in each developer, and the
Xtol does seem to show some detail slightly more clearly. Sorry - this is
not sharpness - this is resolution. Viewing the whole print would show that
the definition, the apparent sharpness, would seem higher with other
developers. Dilute Microdol/Perceptol looks significantly sharper than Xtol
with equally fine grain, though the speed is slightly less obviously. The
acutance-enhancing edge effects of the metol developer score over Xtol.
Anything I develop in Xtol, dilute or otherwise, in 35mm or medium format,
just looks slightly mushy. The effect in large format is far less of course.
Try your Agfa 400 in Rodinal Cor. I think you will like it. If you must use
TMY, a particularly nice combination for apparent sharpness and enhanced
shadow detail/contrast is my own formula metol two bath shown on my web
site. This also helps with the great sensitivity of T-Max films to time of
development. I still think you will prefer the Agfa combination.

Hi all,

I've just got some Xtol, having read good things about it, to use with
Ilford Delta 100 and 400.
The artticle suggested a small speed increase was obtained (1/2 stop -100,
2/3 stop - 400), but I'd be interested to know what others think or have
found.

John
I find Delta 100 in Xtol is a terrible combination - see my comments on
APX400 to Cor Breukel. You get speed and fine grain, but the sharpness is
mushy. I am not a particular fan of Delta 400 anyway, but its lack of
apparent sharpness via edge effects, compared to say to HP5 Plus, is only
exacerbated by Xtol.
Of course, if you are not too bothered by sharpness, and a smoother look is
your aim, Xtol would do the job well. Depends how you prefer your images.
I find I still need to cut speed a little with Xtol (to 80 for 100, to 320
for 400), but you would need to do speed tests with your own equipment.

..First thanks for  your clear reply, Barry! It is reassuring to hear
that it should be possible to get good negatives with APX400 (got still
quite a few rolls in the fridge).  

Could you be so kind to give me a starting point on Rodinal and APX400:
at what speed would you shoot APX400, and at what dilution, temperature
and time do you use Rodinal?

I seem to remember that Rodinal is supposed to have a legendary shelf
life. I was given a botttle quite some time ago, the solution is very
dark now, with even some precipitate on the bottom, so I guess it is
best to dispose this bottle properly and get some new one..

I am aware of the destinction, I just poorly phrased my question, I was
referring to the lack of apparant sharpness, these images do display a
nice grain but are "soft" in appearance..


Thanks again, Barry..I'll test Tmax400/120 in Xtol 1:1 vesrsus
APX400/120 in Rodinal in the near future

Best,

Barry,
I beg to differ on this one. Seems that some combination lens/film/Xtol give
results that are quite different from yours. I do use only 2 developers:
Xtol and PMK, and did learn what I can do with them, and more importantly,
what I cannot do with them. A project I'm working on is shot using Leica M
lenses/HP5+/Xtol is giving me results that can fool the eyes when printed in
11x14". I understand your distinction between resolution and sharpness, but
it seems to me that it is sharp. But once again, maybe it's a question of
personal perception (isn't it what photo is all about?...)

Barry,

Hmmm, Interesting. The article I mentioned was written by Ctein, who writes
(wrote?) in Camera and Darkroom. He was so impressed with Delta in Xtol he
was going to make it his standard combo.

Now I'm confused.     Ok, I guess some testing is called for.

Regards,   John

Cor, 

The other day I finally came to the end of a 500ml bottle of Rodinal which
had been open several years.  It was very dark, but still worked fine.
I've long given up worrying about the keeping properties of Rodinal, and
I'm also a great fan of the APX/Rodinal combo.  I like APX400, so if you
can't get on with it I can give your surplus rolls a good home ;-)  I'm
sure you'll like the results in Rodinal though.  As far as time is
concerned, I find the manufacturer's times work fine for all the APX films,
and 35mm APX25 / Rodinal 1+50 gives excellent results.

Cheers
Richard

I gave somebody a bottle of Rodinal a few years ago, but that person only
used very little of it, so when she recently told me that,  I asked if I
could have the rest back. Real dark stuff inside. But it worked just as
well as newly puchased Rodinal. At least with HP5+

  Definitely. I find Delta 100 in Xtol 1:1 quite the opposite of mushy.

  People are getting such a huge variety of results with Xtol; I think the
consensus is that it's sensitive to water quality or characteristics.

Good idea. See my comments to Luc Novovitch. The need for apparent sharpness
via edge effects grows less as the size of the negative increases anyway. My
tests have been with 35mm and 6x6. I greatly respect Ctein's views, but
disagree with him on this one. Samples are shown in my forthcoming book -
promised by the publisher for October.

Barry,

Hmmm, Interesting. The article I mentioned was written by Ctein, who writes
(wrote?) in Camera and Darkroom. He was so impressed with Delta in Xtol he
was going to make it his standard combo.

Now I'm confused.     Ok, I guess some testing is called for.

Richard is right Cor. If you are really bothered about that precipitate, buy
some new Rodinal - it's a pretty safe investment. Or you could stir the
precipitate into your coffee to add extra flavour!
I find Agfa's published times spot on too.

Something I noticed with Xtol over the years is that the way you mix it
makes a (big) difference. May sounds a little wacky, but it's based on
experience. I get the best results by stiring gently until dissolution of
the powder when mixing to get my 5 liter of Xtol. Worst results were when I
vigourously shook the container to get the powder dissolve. I think, but I'm
not a technician, that the massive input of oxygen when shaking vigourously
is detrimental in getting the best results with Xtol. Seems like it's a way
of speeding up the oxidation of the developer.

Barry,
I beg to differ on this one. Seems that some combination lens/film/Xtol give
results that are quite different from yours. I do use only 2 developers:
Xtol and PMK, and did learn what I can do with them, and more importantly,
what I cannot do with them. A project I'm working on is shot using Leica M
lenses/HP5+/Xtol is giving me results that can fool the eyes when printed in
11x14". I understand your distinction between resolution and sharpness, but
it seems to me that it is sharp. But once again, maybe it's a question of
personal perception (isn't it what photo is all about?...)
/ln

Luc

Absolutely! If you like it, use it.
I have to admit that when I mean sharp, I want SHARP! It's been something of
a life-long obsession with me. To get a true picture we need to do
side-by-side blind comparisons with the variables reduced as much as
possible I did do some tests using Delta 100 in my SL66. I have three backs
for the camera and shot identical pictures of a strongly obliquely lit
textured picture on three films bracketing in half stops to check
comparative speed. The camera, mounted on a heavy tripod, was critically
focussed using the Planar lens at f8, and the exposures were made with
mirror up. The exposures were all made within moments of each other. I
repeated the process within about ten minutes with a further three rolls.
The light was to all intents and purposes unchanged in this time.
I processed the films in:
Perceptol 1:3
Xtol 1:2
ID11 1:3
Ilfotech (for which read HC110) 1:62
DiXactol single bath option
Ilfosol S 1:9
I critically focussed one neg. to make a 20 inch square print on Multigrade
FB, then without changing anything else swapped the negs. and made matching
prints, as closely as was possible - not an easy task! I had to choose among
the 1/2 stop bracketed negs. to try and get as close a match as I could. This
gave a good indication of relative speed.
The sharpest appearance was very clearly given by DiXactol, as you might
expect. It was probably the most grainy, but the stain masks this and makes
it less apparent. The finest grain was given by Perceptol, again as you
might expect. Xtol was only just behind it though, and as a guestimate, was
about 1/4 stop faster than ID11. Perceptol was perhaps 1/4 stop slower than ID11
/Ilfotech/Ilfosol. However, Xtol looked the least sharp. All the other
developers looked about as sharp as each other. The grain of Ilfotech and
Ilfosol was gritty, helping the look of sharpness. Perceptol gave noticeable
edge effects, helping sharpness in a different way. Ilfotech and Ilfosol S
were very slightly more grainy. From this test with this film, I deduced
that Xtol is slightly biased towards fine grain and speed.
This was just with Delta 100. However, in processing hundreds of different
films for clients in their choice of developer, it does seem that my general
impression of Xtol stacks up.
This takes no account, of course, of other pluses like its easy mixing, long
life, and greater environmental friendliness.

  The ID-11 and Perceptol here are diluted to the point where both are
producing considerable edge effects, I would expect them to look "sharp". A
fairer comparison would be to dilute them 1:1 or not at all, particularly
the Perceptol.
  Perceptol is virtually identical to Kodak Microdol-X, it should have
similar performance. The heavy restraining action of the sodium chloride in
both result in about a 3/4 stop speed loss in comparison to D-76/ID-11. At
1:3 the speed is about the same as D-76 but the very fine grain properties
are no longer there, the grain being about the same as D-76/ID-11. However,
at this dilution both Microdol-X and Perceptol have considerable edge
effects due to local exhaustion.
  At 1:3 I find D-76 to have enough edge effect to make the images
unpleasant to my eye. 
  I think it is important to discriminate between apparent sharpness
(acutance), as caused by edge effects, and real sharpness as determined by
resolution. The eye interprets edge contrast as sharpness. A not very sharp
image with enhancement of edge contrast looks much sharper even though it
may not have much actual detail. A sharp grain pattern overlying the image
also results in the illusion of sharpness. So, a diluted extra fine gain
developer, like Perceptol, may give very much sharper looking images from
small negatives when highly diluted. The same for Rodinal, which, at the
high dilutions it can be used at, produces prodigious edge effects and
sharp grain. 
  Developers which tan the gelatin also tend to produce strong edge effects
partly as a result of the difference in penetration of the developer due to
the varying hardness of the gelatin, and partly due to mechanical
distortion of the gelatin as a result of the differential hardening. Such
negatives will generally show a relief image when the emulsion is examined
by reflected light. 
  Since grain and edge effects are of fixed size their effect is different
for large negatives than small ones. I think the concern about this is
mainly about 35mm where the resolution of the films and lenses is often
marginal.

  I wouldn't be surprised.
  I've used only the 1L packets of Xtol, mixed with distilled water, and
always use a magnetic mixer...and have never had any problem with it. Otoh,
if what's purported to be a general-purpose D-76 replacement requires all
that to be reliable and consistent then it certainly doesn't live up to
Kodak's claims and probably wouldn't be a good choice for the casual user.
  I've found Xtol 1:1 and 1:2 to give somewhat more graininess and acutance
with HP5+ and Delta 100 than D-76/ID-11 1:1, quite the opposite of the
usual statements about reduced graininess. While the increased acutance is
nice it's not tremendously higher and imho not worth the much more visible
graininess.
  Maybe it works better with other films.

Hello every body,

    I have always been told that D 76 and ID 11 are strictly identical
formula. Is that right ?

  The published formulas are the same but the packaged developers are not,
according to their MSDS. 
  Packaged Kodak D-76 is actually the buffered formula D-76d. It contains
both borax and boric acid in equal amounts. This buffering eliminates a
problem the original formula has of increasing activity slowly on storage
due to a complex interaction between the hydroquinone and sulfite.
  ID-11 is (according to its MSDS) more like the original D-76 but has a
sequestering agent added, probably to eliminate the slight fogging D-76
produces from deposition of dissolved silver. I am not sure what effect
this might have on grain since part of the fine grain characteristic of
developers of the D-76 type is due to partial physical development.
  Ilford Microphen is similar to D-76 with Phenidone replacing the Metol.
It is buffered in a similar way to D-76d. It contains restrainers, required
by the Phenidone.

"Regular" D-76 contains 2 grams per liter of Borax. D-76d contains 8 grams
of Borax and 8 grams of boric acid per liter. With equal amounts the
activity is the same as _fresh_ standard D-76.

  Time/Temperature charts can be use for D-76 and ID-11 interchangibly. 
  This formula is now 74 years old!

The published formulae are identical, but who knows what Kodak or Ilford
might actually be putting into their packaged developers?

Lorena,

I've never tried this combination but I have heard of people using PMK with
a 1:1:100 dilution to process lith film for con tone interpositives for
making duplicate negatives. I would start there and see how that works. You
may even want to try something like 1:.5:100 and then stain in sodium
carbonate.

Let us know how that works if you try it. Perhaps some other PMK sage will
chime in.

Many thanks Richard,

    I prepare D 76 myself 2g of metol, 100g of sodium sulphite, 10g of
hydroquinone and 2g of borax. That is the non buffered formula. I use
distillated water and put the solution in dark,full, closed small bottles
with the exact quantities needed for let say 2 35mmm or 2 120 ( I use it at
1:1 dilution for trix prof 120). Doing this I have kept the solution for 6
months without any differences in results (contrary to what Kodak is saying
).

    Daniel

Hello every body,

    Does any one know the difference of formula between T Max and T Max RS .
I have found that for T Max 400 and 100 T Max RS gave much more details in
the shadows and for T Max 400 35mm I develop 6mn and half at 20C for
condenser enlarger ( Durst 1200 ). The problem is that T Max RS is very
expensive. What is the experience of the other members?

    Daniel

For tests, I'd suggest using twice the amount of water as indicated  for
approximately 10 min with constant agitation in a tray at 68F. An EI of
around 16 should work fairly well.

Kodalith can also be used with PMK 1:1, with bracketing around an EI of
4. 
I develop the film by inspection under a deep red light. Depending upon
exposure, 
tones can be shifted to the low contrast / high value shoulder of the
curve, or the high contrast linear region. Development by inspection
by-passes the requirement
for extensive testing.

 Snipping here...
  
  You are doubling the Hydroquinone. The formula for standard D-76 is:

Kodak D-76
Water (at about 125F)			750.0 ml
Metol						  2.0 grams
Sodium Sulfite, anhydrous		100.0 grams
Hydroquinone				  5.0 grams
Borax, granular				  2.0 grams
Water to make				  1.0 liter

The buffered version, D-76d is:

Kodak D-76d
Water						750.0 ml
Metol						  2.0 grams
Sodium Sulfite, anhydrous		100.0 grams
Hydroquinone				  5.0 grams
Borax, granular				  8.0 grams
Boric Acid, crystals			  8.0 grams
Water to make				  1.0 liter

 The activity can be adjusted over a wide range by varying the ratio of
borax to boric acid.
With equal amounts the activity will be the same as the un buffered version.

  The problems with rising activity of the standard formula was discovered
shortly after its announcement in 1926. The buffered version was announced
in a 1929 paper by Carlton and Crabtree of Kodak labs. In this paper they
document the rise in activity over a two month period. The development time
required for a given gamma is nearly halved over that time.
  They did not analyse the cause of the problem but it was discovered
later. There is a slow reaction of the Hydroquinone and sulfite which both
raises the pH and produces a reaction product which is an effective
developing agent. 
  The data for the buffered version of D-76 shows no such rise in activity. 
  The best analysis of the chemistry of this change is one posted by
Michael Gudzinowicz to the rec.photo.darkroom group some time ago. I was
able to find it on Deja.com. Its probably still there. Mike is a Phd chemist.
  D-76 is one of the first developers to be designed with any understanding
of the action of development. It takes advantage of the super additivity of
Metol and Hydroquinone. The Hydroquinone is nearly inactive in D-76 due to
the relatively low pH. It acts to regenerate the Metol. D-76 with the
Hydroquinone left out is about as effective as the complete formula but is
not as long lived. In their paper Carlton and Crabtree tried just about
every variation of the formula possible. 
  A pretty good developer can be made by increasing the Metol to 5
grams/liter and leaving out the Hydroquinone. If the Borax is left out and
the Metol increased to 7.5 grams/liter you have D-23.
  D-76 has no restrainer. A very small amount of bromide added (around 0.7
gram/liter) will suppress the slight fog characteristic of high sulfite
developers, resulting in a slight speed increase. Agfa/Ansco used the
bromide in their version of D-76. Since bromide is leached out of film
during development its possible that developer which has been used once may
show some speed increase the second time, but that will depend on how much
bromide has gotten into it. The general effect of bromide is to lower
shadow speed. 
  D-76, and its variations, was the most common developer for the motion
picture industry for decades, its probably been analysed more thoroughly
than any other formula. 
  I cannot explain why you haven't experienced the change in activity,
perhaps its because of using the develop diluted. The effect is very well
documented. 

  BTW, I looked again for the MSDS for ID-11 on Hazard.com, a good on-line
source for MSDS. What I found was not the same one I've seen before. The
older MSDS contained Cinnamic Acid Disulfide, a sequestering agent. This is
evidently the "plus" in ID-11+. The current MSDS contains a phosphate,
which may also be a sequestering agent and is likely also a buffer. 
  Ilford Microphen uses the same Borax/boric acid buffer system as D-76d.

You are right I made a mistake on the hydroquinone. As I prepare 2l of 
developer I have forgotten to divide by 2 the hydroquinone but the quantity
I weight is 5g per liter. Sorry for that and thank you for the information.
I am myself a Ph D chemist.

Has anyone ever managed to get 'pictorial' results with a techpan/PMK pyro 
combination? Obviously the formula would need to be varied - has anyone 
tried this?
I just purchased a box of 4x5 technical pan film with the promise of

Lorena,
I've never tried this combination but I have heard of people using PMK with
a 1:1:100 dilution to process lith film for con tone interpositives for
making duplicate negatives. I would start there and see how that works. You
may even want to try something like 1:.5:100 and then stain in sodium
carbonate.

Let us know how that works if you try it. Perhaps some other PMK sage will
chime in.


Don
Sounds interesting. I haven't used PMK for Tech Pan, but have played about
by reducing the amount of B by various amounts to control excessive subject
brightness ranges with films like Verichrome Pan, Delta 100 and Pan F. It
did work in reducing negative contrast, but there was also a big and
unwelcome drop in the stain which, by reducing printing density, also
noticeably dropped effective film speed.

How right you are to be sceptical. The times quoted by Ilford in their
technical information on their various films are different for ID11 and D76.
Also, with Microdol and Perceptol, for instance, which are supposed to be
darned near identical, the times also vary. It is noticeable that Microdol
is very conveniently mixed from a single powder, whereas Perceptol isn't.
Metol is not supposed to dissolve in a sodium sulphite solution. If Microdol
is metol based, how do they manage the single powder mix?

  The ID-11 and Perceptol here are diluted to the point where both are
producing considerable edge effects, I would expect them to look "sharp". A
fairer comparison would be to dilute them 1:1 or not at all, particularly
the Perceptol.
  Perceptol is virtually identical to Kodak Microdol-X, it should have
similar performance. The heavy restraining action of the sodium chloride in
both result in about a 3/4 stop speed loss in comparison to D-76/ID-11. At
1:3 the speed is about the same as D-76 but the very fine grain properties
are no longer there, the grain being about the same as D-76/ID-11. However,
at this dilution both Microdol-X and Perceptol have considerable edge
effects due to local exhaustion.
  At 1:3 I find D-76 to have enough edge effect to make the images
unpleasant to my eye.
  I think it is important to discriminate between apparent sharpness
(acutance), as caused by edge effects, and real sharpness as determined by
resolution. The eye interprets edge contrast as sharpness. A not very sharp
image with enhancement of edge contrast looks much sharper even though it
may not have much actual detail. A sharp grain pattern overlying the image
also results in the illusion of sharpness. So, a diluted extra fine gain
developer, like Perceptol, may give very much sharper looking images from
small negatives when highly diluted. The same for Rodinal, which, at the
high dilutions it can be used at, produces prodigious edge effects and
sharp grain.
  Developers which tan the gelatin also tend to produce strong edge effects
partly as a result of the difference in penetration of the developer due to
the varying hardness of the gelatin, and partly due to mechanical
distortion of the gelatin as a result of the differential hardening. Such
negatives will generally show a relief image when the emulsion is examined
by reflected light.
  Since grain and edge effects are of fixed size their effect is different
for large negatives than small ones. I think the concern about this is
mainly about 35mm where the resolution of the films and lenses is often
marginal.
Richard
That is just about what I have found to be the case. Any thoughts on the
effects of higher dilutions of Ilfotech HC or HC110 in terms of edge
effects?
Also, I don't know whether you have Ilfosol S over in the US, but I am very
curious as to its recipe. It is a most pronounced yellow colour even when
fresh, and produces a gritty, though fine, grain pattern. I Have not been
able to wheedle information out of Ilford as to its composition. It is
interesting that it is Ilford's recommended liquid developer above all
others for "best overall image quality", "finest grain", and "maximum
sharpness" in their technical information for FP4 Plus, as it also used to
be for the old FP4. It is a little known/used and under-appreciated
developer in my opinion, maybe because it only comes in a 300ml bottle of
concentrate.

Yes the film speed probably will drop, I'm glad you mentioned that. As for
staining I always do a stain soak in sodium carbonate now and I find that
provides a very nice stain. I use roughly 25g per liter.

I have also tried a combo of HC-110 and phenedone which gave a big speed
increase but Tech-Pan always streaks on me so I gave up on it. And I think
John Hicks has tried C-41 developer at 68F for 9m and gotten excellent
results but I can't remember the EI he uses for that combo.

Anyway a lot of possibilities with this film.

Hello Everybody.
I'm new to the internet but am already enjoying this site. It is just =
great to be able to participate / share such an accumulation of =
experience and knowledge. (I'm trying to keep up).
Since learning to print I have been using various print developers (Agfa =
WA, Kodak's Dektol, Ilford's MG, Eukobrom(UK labels)), and am now about =
to start trying some of the published formulas that have appeared in =
books like S Anchells' "Darkroom cookbook".=20
I realise that with so many experts out there I run the risk of sounding =
like a philistine, but is there any point in mixing your own paper =
developer ?=20
If so, is Amidol worth trying out?
The Westons all used it, Adams thought it could block up the shadows.?
Does such varied opinion stem from different tastes, the use of =
different papers, or from different types of negatives, ( ... Westons =
pyro, Adams HC110)?
Does anyone have any thoughts, formulas, favorite combinations of paper =
/ developer?
The negs I am printing are PMK or DiXactol if this makes a difference.
Scott Morrish.

Yes, Amidol can be worth it. It is one more fine tool to use to get your =
images to look the way you would like them to. Both Michael A. Smith and =
Paula Chamlee develop Azo in Amidol & get stunning results... it works =
very well for them. Others can shoot the same subject matter and also =
get stunning results using alt processes or different papers & =
developers. No, they don't look like the prints developed in Amidol, =
they aren't supposed to as you know. They look like the artist wants =
them to look, choosing the developer/paper/film combinations to suit =
their creative goals.

But, try Amidol and see if it works for you.

    But with Edwal paper developer, I can pass prints and keep on going =

Some time back, I had a problem with a white streak running down the center
of my negs.  Some individuals suggested I refix.  Well, I finally got around
to do it.  Great, the streak is gone but now have little raised bubbles
running sporatically down the center of the neg.  Is there any hope in
saving the negs.  What happened, over fixed?

This is off-topic, so kill if you don't care...

I grew up on Kodiak Island in Alaska.  Last week I went there to visit family
and, while there, got a chance to fly down to Bear country.  I took a walk
and shot a ton of stuff: B&W, digital, and (gasp) color.  The Bears are
pretty used to people gawking at them and we got pretty close - too close,
as it turns out - we beat a hasty retreat when two of them started
wrestling around just a bit too close to us (about 40 feet). 

Anyway, just for fun, I posted a few of the digital pix on my web site.
These are not art, they're pure tourist stuff, but fun nonetheless.
They are also 1600x1200, so it may take a while to download.  If you
care, have a look at: http://www.tundraware.com/Bears

Now, back to *real* photography

Amidol is not particularly toxic. It is Pyro, which by rumor, gave Weston
Parkinson's. There is, in fact, no evidence of this whatsoever. However,
Pyro is toxic enough to require some care when preparing developers with it. 
  Both Amidol and Pyro are prodidious stainers when they oxidize. Keep them
off your clothing and hands. Pyro leaves brown or yellow stains, Amidol
black stains. Both are hard to get off once they form. 
  Amidol is a very good developer, but not magic. Amidol formulas are very
simple and easy to mix. There is nothing wrong with the stuff except it is
too expensive.

Please, PLEASE, users of Outlook Express, Outlook, and Netscape mail, set
your programs to send _Plain text_. Not HTML or RTF. Many mail readers
cannot deal with this stuff. 
  HTML or Microsoft text more then double the size of messages.
  It is a very good practice to send only plain text to mailing lists.

  Whatever it is its not overfixing. There isn't much which will actually
disrupt the gelatin. A strongly acid stop bath or fixing bath after a
developer with lots of carbonate in it might do it, but the voids would be
very small and evenly distributed. 
  Can you look at these bubbles with a strong loupe and see what additional
evidence you can find. This is a very strange problem.

Hello,
I have just joined this discussion group. I am an
amateur photograher. Could anyone offer some advice on
the following?
 I am in the process of finnishing converting half of
my garage to a darkroom. I am currently using a Meopta
Opemus IIa cira 1965. I am going to buy another
enlarger. There are not any limitations I cannot get
around from the Meopta but the following distractions
are irratating. Lack of column height (9-10x on 35mm),
lack of intensity on 12*16. I currently use 35mm and
21/4 square and do not currently have any desire to
proceed to 5x4 film or enlargement larger than 12x16
or colour.
The three models I am considering are :
Devere 203, with varicon head, 6x9 and 35mm condensors
at 690
LPL 7451, column enlager, with colour head and all
fitting up to 5x4 for 500.
GEM enlarger with colour and multigrade heads for upto
67 for 440.
Spending  690 is pushing the amount I want to spend
but I really like the ease of focus and head height
adjustment on the Devere. Has any one got any warning
messages about any problems with any of these?

Thanks and regards
Richard

No strong loupe, just use my 50mm enlarging lens.  Looked at the negs this
morning, the swelling of the gelatin went down.  Looking at the negs under
my lens, the gelatin looks similar to what you would see if you broke a pane
of safety glass.  At the swelling spots,  there is no image, just clear.  I
should mention that all the swelling of gelatin is down the center of the
neg, just like the white streak.

  If you check older View Camera magazine issues you will find Michael =
A. Smiths amidol formula. A one litre batch can develop about 80 8x10 =
sheets of Azo, from personal experience, over 3-5 days if you put it in =
a stoppered bottle in between darkroom stints. Michaels small change in =
the formula helps it last more than the 'few hours' of lore.

  The stuff works well and if you are working with contact prints with =
larger negs on Azo you might really like how it looks. Michael and =
Paulas prints both have a real life to them. They shoot with the old =
Kodak Super XX. Since this isn't available any longer you can use =
Bergger 200 and get similar results. Or, use what you like in more =
modern films and develop to get the contact print quality that fills =
your creative needs.

  Amidol IS expensive, no doubt about it. But it lasts nearly forever =
without losing strength and is a good match for the Azo paper. But it is =
only one alternative in the arsenal of creativity. For reasons of =
personal experience if nothing else, it is worth trying. But, if one =
can't get those 'Weston results' with it, it is usually due to =
insufficient experience & time with the stuff rather than all newer =
materials being better. Almost any combination can give excellent =
results if one spends the time with it.

  Amidol isn't 'better' than most combinations out there, but one fine =
choice if you like working with larger negatives and contact printing. =
It is a viable combination with Azo and in the hands of a good =
photographer will yield results that are excellent, with its own 'look' =
that may or may not fill your creative needs.

  Used carefully it can produce prints that rival and in cases even =
exceed the tonal range one gets using platinum printing materials. It is =
good stuff. One of the big advantages some of us have found is that in a =
printing session we are more productive. Since the Azo paper sits in the =
Amidol for only 60 seconds, you can contact print a lot more work, doing =
30-60 prints in an evening or morning. Be advised that Azo is a single =
weight paper though and will require careful handling.

  If one is in Salt Lake City before August 14, there is a good show in =
the Salt Lake Art Center featuring Azo/Amidol images of both Michael A. =
Smith (8x20 contacts) and Paula Chamlee (8x10 contacts), so you can  see =
two modern masters using this combination. At the same time you can see =
the contact prints of Steve Simmons of Veiw Camera/Camera Arts =
magazines, traditional silver prints. The excellent and delicate 7x17 =
inch platinum prints of Lois Conner, as well as original 20x24 Polaroid =
prints from Tracy Storer. Then there are the 12x20 contact prints from =
Tillman Crane, some I know using Bergger paper & a glycin based =
developer.=20

  The show is excellent and offers the chance to see first rate works =
with various films and paper/developer combinations side by side. A =
great way to get the idea of just how good some large format contacts =
can look with different papers and developers, from the standards to =
more exotic brews.

What is the dog ear lever on the right supposed to do?  Looked under the

  Because Eudora version 4 can display HTML. It also can use Outlook as its
display device and is set to do this by default. Eudora can also sent
formatted text but is easier to set up not to. Its in the preferences. It
should also be set up to respond to formatted text with plain text.
  Beware that if you use Outlook Express as the viewer for Eudora you are
subject to the same security problem that Outlook and Outlook Express have
of automatically running Visual Basic scripts. You need to both load the
patch from Microsoft to turn off this feature (you can not disable it
othewise) and to use Eudora itself to display messages. Eudora has a
setting for scripts in the preferences.
  Note that some Eudora settings must be made by editing the .ini file.
There is quite a bit of information on the Eudora.com and Qualcomm.com web
sites.
  I finally re-installed the older form of Eudora after some very annoying
system crashes with the newer version. I also just hate the "sponsored"
version. After re-installing Eudora 3.6 over the newer version I find I now
have a spelling checker:-)

John,

If you dialed in some magenta or yellow that lever cancels the filtration 
which makes it easier to focus.

I should have said mine has a condenser head.  The filters go into a tray
above the top condenser, there is no way that I could see this lever acting

    I took a look at mine:  The lever on the right is connected to a 
white cam that moves up against the column.  Nearest I can figure is 
that it's **supposed** to lock the head at one height.... not that it 
seems to to do that well, but that's my guess.
    Happy enlarging!

P-S,
Printing @ home for the first time, since taking a night course at the local
H.S.  I have a few of questions.

1.  I normally shoot D100 and use rodinal.  Looking for something with a
little more speed so I speak up a pack of HP5+ (120).  Just developed them
this evening with ilfotec hc.  I'm use to seeing clear edges on my negs with
rodinal, does ilfotec hc stain?  Since I don't know what a stained negative
looks like.   The edges of the negs are a light chocolate brown.  Normal?
Other than this the images look fanstatic.

2.  Tried printing a few frames of the HP5+, is it supposed to be this
tough.  The enlarger has a #2 filter, I was printing upto 1 min @f11 and
barely got an image.  Tried without filter, still no better.  Then my bulb
goes out, could that have caused these printing times.

Thanks
John Kufrovich

Hello.
With the comments on "Formatted text" / Outlook Express in mind, could
someone tell me if this message is one of those presenting a problem. I am
generally baffled by all this computer speak. I think i am corresponding in
"plain text", I am using "Outlook" Is everyting as it should be?

THANKYOU
A huge thankyou to those who forwarded info. related to Amidol.
I anticipate having a great time checking this out, and especially look
forward to seeing it with Azo.
Does anybody know if Azo is available in the UK?
Many thanks

If you check older View Camera magazine issues you will find Michael A.
Smiths amidol formula. A one litre batch can develop about 80 8x10 sheets of
Azo, from personal experience, over 3-5 days if you put it in a stoppered
bottle in between darkroom stints. Michaels small change in the formula
helps it last more than the 'few hours' of lore.

The stuff works well and if you are working with contact prints with larger
negs on Azo you might really like how it looks. Michael and Paulas prints
both have a real life to them. They shoot with the old Kodak Super XX. Since
this isn't available any longer you can use Bergger 200 and get similar
results. Or, use what you like in more modern films and develop to get the
contact print quality that fills your creative needs.

Amidol IS expensive, no doubt about it. But it lasts nearly forever without
losing strength and is a good match for the Azo paper. But it is only one
alternative in the arsenal of creativity. For reasons of personal experience
if nothing else, it is worth trying. But, if one can't get those 'Weston
results' with it, it is usually due to insufficient experience & time with
the stuff rather than all newer materials being better. Almost any
combination can give excellent results if one spends the time with it.

Amidol isn't 'better' than most combinations out there, but one fine choice
if you like working with larger negatives and contact printing. It is a
viable combination with Azo and in the hands of a good photographer will
yield results that are excellent, with its own 'look' that may or may not
fill your creative needs.

Used carefully it can produce prints that rival and in cases even exceed the
tonal range one gets using platinum printing materials. It is good stuff.
One of the big advantages some of us have found is that in a printing
session we are more productive. Since the Azo paper sits in the Amidol for
only 60 seconds, you can contact print a lot more work, doing 30-60 prints
in an evening or morning. Be advised that Azo is a single weight paper
though and will require careful handling.

If one is in Salt Lake City before August 14, there is a good show in the
Salt Lake Art Center featuring Azo/Amidol images of both Michael A. Smith
(8x20 contacts) and Paula Chamlee (8x10 contacts), so you can  see two
modern masters using this combination. At the same time you can see the
contact prints of Steve Simmons of Veiw Camera/Camera Arts magazines,
traditional silver prints. The excellent and delicate 7x17 inch platinum
prints of Lois Conner, as well as original 20x24 Polaroid prints from Tracy
Storer. Then there are the 12x20 contact prints from Tillman Crane, some I
know using Bergger paper & a glycin based developer.

The show is excellent and offers the chance to see first rate works with
various films and paper/developer combinations side by side. A great way to
get the idea of just how good some large format contacts can look with
different papers and developers, from the standards to more exotic brews.

Thanks to all that replied.  I went to bed thinking about my mistake.  I
must of suffered a brain fart, my math was wrong, I only used 15ml instead
of 150ml.  Refixed this morning everything looks great.

We have a our annual photo contest @work, trying to get something together
for it.  Now must get a new bulb for the enlarger,  are those bulbs
available at the local hardware store.

Thanks for putting up with me
JK

Well Christer,
Sometime back, I bought a 10-pack of d3200 and a bottle of DD-x.  Calumet
sent the wrong bottle, Ilfotec HC.  It was mark with Calumet product code
number for DD-x.  So they corrected my order and was told to keep the bottle
of HC.  Just wanted to give it a try but plan to definitely use rodinal the
next go around.  Really a big fan of D100 shot at 50 and rodinal 100:1, but
sure is hard to catch my two little ones running around in the yard.

Boy, that HC stuff is like syrup.

Why did you print at f/11? - That is two stops down, my 105 fujinon-ep
starts at 5.6.

Just as soon as I can get a new bulb, I'm going to get back in there and try
those refixed negs.  I don't think I'll have any more problems.

jk

I have a few questions to you too ;-)

Why did you not use Rodinal with your HP5, this is a very nice combination?

Why did you print at f/11? There is usually no need to stop down more than
two or three steps from the full lens opening in order to get a 'sharp'
print

>I grew up on Kodiak Island in Alaska>  Tim Daneliuk

    ..... Snipped!.....

This is the most enjoyable area I ever photographed ... { threw that in just
to keep to the photo subject...:o) }
Howdy, Neighbor!!
 My wife and I spent a some time in the early 80's living in your backyard!
We lived in Womans Bay just outside of Kodiak .....Bells Flats to be exact.
I did a little Aerial photography
{ Sea Otter research}  there and at Katami, and the Bristol Bay area from
Cold Bay north.
What a wonderful surprise to find someone who is a native of the "Island
Terrific in the North Pacific" on the Pure silver list!
Miss it, Miss it, Miss it!
Enjoyed the images and hope that you will at least let us know by email if
you have any more Kodiak images going up! You did get close didn't
you!!!!!!!
 If you ever have time I would surly enjoy corresponding by email about the
Greenest Place on Earth { haven't been back in 16 years!  - got a bunch of
questions } !!!!!!!
  As we live in  and photograph in the Southern Appalachians now all I can
say is " small world"......what a pleasure to hear from an old neighbor. You
might enjoy http://members.xoom.com/keithrogan/ it is from a fellow that is
originally from near me in the Appalachian Mountains (USA}.... he was not so
lucky as to escape the wrath of a "brownie".
 Wish I could go back too,
Chuck  natureseen@mindspring.com

Good morning.
Does anyone in the UK have any Azo kicking around I could buy?
It'd be nice to check it out before importing.
Scott Morrish.
 
PS Thanks Andrew for the Freestyle address.

Probably because you're using a mailer that can convert formatted text
(Eudora 4.3.2).  My version (3.0.5) doesn't do a very good job, and there
are other issues with 4.3.2 that I couldn't cope with.

I recently joined another Majordomo list, and the list-owner has set
Majordomo up to reject anything other than plain text.  I really can't see
the point of HTML etc in email - it simply bloats the message often by
several hundred percent simply to turn the text blue or something.

Please don't use it!

Richard

Hi John,

I usually use Xtol 1+1 with Delta 100 but  sometimes I use Rodinal1+25 when
I want to get that special effect. I havn't got any times  for Delta 100
exposed at 50 and developed in Rodinal 1+100 so I would be interested in
yours. Please also give agitation details and the quantity of undiluted
Rodinal you use for each film.

Thanks and regards

You do not mention the film type. I had similar with Fuji Neopan some time
ago. They advised send it back, I did & heard nothing for about 3months.
After many phone calls I was told that that day it had been sent to Japan as
they could not sort it out. The following day it arrived back to me with no
note, explanation or comment. I do not use that film anymore. I know this is
no help at all, just makes me feel better.
Andrew.

Hello,
I have just joined this discussion group. I am an
amateur photograher. Could anyone offer some advice on
the following?
I am in the process of finnishing converting half of
my garage to a darkroom. I am currently using a Meopta
Opemus IIa cira 1965. I am going to buy another
enlarger. There are not any limitations I cannot get
around from the Meopta but the following distractions
are irratating. Lack of column height (9-10x on 35mm),
lack of intensity on 12*16. I currently use 35mm and
21/4 square and do not currently have any desire to
proceed to 5x4 film or enlargement larger than 12x16
or colour.
The three models I am considering are :
Devere 203, with varicon head, 6x9 and 35mm condensors
at 690
LPL 7451, column enlager, with colour head and all
fitting up to 5x4 for 500.
GEM enlarger with colour and multigrade heads for upto
67 for 440.
Spending  690 is pushing the amount I want to spend
but I really like the ease of focus and head height
adjustment on the Devere. Has any one got any warning
messages about any problems with any of these?

Thanks and regards
Richard

I recently bought a Devere 203 from a friend who had gone DI. Love it, no
more swinging on the focus control while trying to look thro' the grain
magnifier. The build is excellent, & it would appear that all spares & parts
are readily available. Everything about it seems just right and I am very
happy with the performance. I know nothing about the others you mention, but
cannot find anything that I would like to see improved. Glad he went DI.

Check that you can get a carrier with at least a top glass. If you can't,
and you couldn't with the otherwise excellent De Vere last time I checked,
you will never be sure of getting critically sharp prints from even the best
lens with the glassless carrier. This is not just a question of the negative
'popping' under heat. No glassless carrier I have ever seen holds the
negative acceptably flat.

I plead guilty to using formatted text, but not intentionally. For some
reason, even though I select 'plain text' under the Options menu on Outlook,
it randomly changes itself between plain text and RTF(but not the other
option, Word format). Can't figure this one out, but I'll be careful in
future to check for plain text in the message header.

  Because Eudora version 4 can display HTML. It also can use Outlook as its
display device and is set to do this by default. Eudora can also sent
formatted text but is easier to set up not to. Its in the preferences. It
should also be set up to respond to formatted text with plain text.
  Beware that if you use Outlook Express as the viewer for Eudora you are
subject to the same security problem that Outlook and Outlook Express have
of automatically running Visual Basic scripts. You need to both load the
patch from Microsoft to turn off this feature (you can not disable it
othewise) and to use Eudora itself to display messages. Eudora has a
setting for scripts in the preferences.
  Note that some Eudora settings must be made by editing the .ini file.
There is quite a bit of information on the Eudora.com and Qualcomm.com web
sites.
  I finally re-installed the older form of Eudora after some very annoying
system crashes with the newer version. I also just hate the "sponsored"
version. After re-installing Eudora 3.6 over the newer version I find I now
have a spelling checker:-)

For D100, EI50, Rodinal 1+100.  I do most of my b&w work in 120.  I use
400ml of water to 4 ml of rodinal, process 20c@20min.  Agitate for first 30
sec and then 4 gentle inversions for 10 sec every minute.  This combination
works great FOR ME in overcast or shadowed conditions.

Hello again
Thanks to all for advice on Amidol.
Has opened new doors of both possibilities and experimentation for me.
Thankyou.
As is the way with these things, it has also raised new issues, i.e.
enlarging negatives for contact printing.
I would appreciate any info. on Top-notch techniques / materials ( &/or
combinations) that I can use to
achieve a rich and luminous print quality. Besides richness and luminosuty
the impression of "biting" sharpness is, for me, crucial.
Once again...
Any Ideas?
Scott Morrish.

Hello,
Sorry for the off topic message, but I would appreciate input by email (
luc@overland.net) , if you have the time, of 11x14" cameras users. I'm
considering a Korona but would like to have some feed back from users before
jumping...
Many thanks.

Sue, Scott and UK lurkers,

I have around 300 sheets to spare from a 500 sheet box of Kodak "Azo" 8 x 10
Grade 2 Single Weight.
I'm prepared to break it down into packs of 20 sheets at a time for which
the cost would be 15 (fifteen pounds) per pack including postage/packing
and VAT at the current rate... and I'll pop a copy of C&D in the package for
those who haven't seen the magazine.

Let me know by e-mail off list if you are interested.

Cheers,

To C&D magazine subscribers on the Pure Silver list...

     I have had few chances during the past three months to make contact
with subscribers, advertisers and trade/PR recipients of Camera & Darkroom
magazine because of a series of related mishaps on the domestic scene 
hopefully this letter will answer some recent written, e-mail or telephone
queries.
      Some to whom this letter is addressed will know of my wifes long-term
problems with MS (one of the reasons why I have had the opportunity to
publish the magazine from home since 1993 and also why I have never been
able to attend photo trade shows, product launches, etc.). To add to this
difficulty, shortly before Easter Trish had an awkward fall on the slate
floor in our house and badly fractured her left hip and shoulder  she is
also, unfortunately, naturally left-handed, which resulted in a lengthy
hospitalisation in Aberystwyth and then in the local Machynlleth
rehabilitation unit from which she was recently discharged. During that time
I was with her for at least 12-hours every day as part of the NHS
recommended healing process. However, since she has been at home my efforts
have of necessity become more in the order of 24-hours-a-day care with
wheelchair, commode, Zimmer frame, etc. in constant use a situation that
will improve slowly during the next three to four months as she becomes
slightly more mobile and, importantly, self-reliant. Due to this regime I
have only managed a maximum of two hours continuous sleep at any one time
for over a month. Trish is making a recovery, albeit a slow one, but five
physiotherapy, occupational therapy and acupuncture sessions a week are
beginning to show an improvement in her well-being. 
      Obviously my energies have been with my wife throughout and the
forthcoming issue of Camera & Darkroom had to be put on hold for at least
a couple of months. Nevertheless, the issue (2000#2) is now with the printer
and is scheduled for an August publication date  to be followed by two
further issues this year. As a result of this rescheduling the magazine has
had to revert to its original quarterly format, and, all subscriptions on
the database have been adjusted accordingly so that no-one misses out on an
issue they have paid for.
      I hope you understand our difficulties and how we are having to cope
with them at the present time  and having expressed them as best as I can I
hope you will continue to support  Camera & Darkroom so it continues to be
informative reading and inspiration for dedicated photographers and darkroom
workers.

  Barry, I am not sure about Outlook but Eudora version 4 allows choosing
whether to _reply_ to formatted text with the same or with plain text.
Outlook may use formatting when the original message is formatted. I don't
know how to disable this in outlook. 
  I am another who re-installed Eudore 3 after finding version 4 just too
much trouble. Unfortunately version 3 does not quote HTML properly tending
to truncate messages.

Having looked at Bostick And Sullivan site, am left wondering if there is
any chance of going direct to an enlarged negative from the original Neg.
Surely the more steps involved simply degrade image quality.
Ideally i would like to find a process that goes from neg. to neg. in one
go,
on a material that can be developed under safelights.
Am i missing something obvious?
Scott.

Re. Photovision.

Does anyone know if this mag is available in the UK?

There is no contact no. or e-mail  on the website, only a subscription
credit card form which is presumably US only although not stated

Scott,  Yes you are missing something.  While there are ways to go one step to
an enlarged negative, the film is not as good as those used in two steps, and
without many many hours of testing to use a reversal process, the results
don't justify the time spent.

I list several sites of interest on my site.  One with more complete
instructions is Jeffrey Mathias.

Tim,

I received the first issue of "Photovision - Art & Technique" about 3 weeks
ago... I'd visited their website earlier this year but cannot remember
whether or not I'd given subscription address / payment card details.
Certainly there was no comp slip with the mag... the envelope was postmarked
Crestone Colorado and had a "PhotoWork" label attached, which was presumably
the original working title.

The magazine has the "feel" of the original American "Camera & Darkroom"...
probably because the editorial team includes Thom Harrop and Steve Anchell
who were both closely associated with the old C&D. Also on the team is Paul
Lewis, one of my own subscribers, who was the tech editor on Steve's second
"film processing / darkroom" book.

Overall, the new magazine is of nice quality, on semi-gloss paper throughout
(I'd say 125gsm weight, like my own mag), with well reproduced portfolios
(Tim, there's a portfolio of "lith" prints from Eileen Woolford which would
interest you <s>), technical features on ABC Pyro, Linhof cameras, getting
into the Zone System and a review of the Hass Intellifaucet... and that's
about it. It is stylish, in the "View Camera" sense, but doesn't have the
heavyweight technical interest that, say, the American "Photo Techniques" or
the British "Ag+" magazines have.

Having said that, I'll subscribe... small magazines often get my support
<g>... and like "B&W", it will be one to keep. Perhaps if enough UK folks
want to subscribe to it I'll do an import deal with the publisher similar to
the one I have with "B&W"... but as you say there are no "foreign"
subscription details on the website, or in the magazine, so I don't know
what it will cost.

Cheers,

Ed Buziak / Publisher
Camera & Darkroom magazine

The dilution is 1+7+300 as you say.
You may be able to buy packs of just the B solution which
will sort out the problem (at least we can here in the UK). 
Should you try the Two bath option then of course you will 
use them at the same rate. Good luck.

Hello.
Having tried Gold toner on a few (cold/neutral) papers some time ago,
I had not been too impressed, and left it in the bottle at the back 
of the self. Yesterday tried it again on a lith print (Kentona) and was 
astonished. The density increase and colour shift was huge.
A couple of Questions. 
I know gold toner has archival benefits through a different type of 
process to selenium toner. Is it only "archived" once it has gone all the 
way through to its blue grey conclusion? Or does just the early shift of 
colour indicate adequate protection?
Would there be some kind of stain, as with selenium, if the print 
had not been washed enough prior to toning?
(I took the print through HCA and then washed it before gold toning).
Where can one learn about the chemistry and the chemical reactions 
taking place in these vaious processes, so as to achieve a greater 
understanding whilst not needing qualifications in science? 
Is there, for example, a definitive book?
Scott Morrish.

Question to DiXactol users:

I just got the DiXactol from photographers' formulary...

Am I correct that the normal dilution is 1+7+300 ?
If that so, it seems Solution B will soon be used up before
solution A since both A/B come in same volume in its kit

Am I miss something ?

Hope my English is understandable

Thanks,

C.J. Cheng

Can somebody please let me know the merits of using a developer such as
DiXactol.
I am a complete beginner so please be careful with me. I am taking courses
at college and wish to start developing at home and need help.
The developer used at my college is either Ilford Ilfosol or ID11. Is
DiXactol much better than these? What properties does it have or not over
the Ilford developers?

Your help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks Ed. Yes I had heard about the lith article - that was when I first
mailed them weeks ago, but they didn't respond. I guess they don't need any
more subscribers or contributors ;-)
I like to support these ventures too - but in this case it is proving
difficult!

In response...
Stick with what you using at the moment. Do not change things for the sake
of it until you fully understand those that you are using. From experiance,
you can waste alot of time, and money, and go around huge circles only to
discover that where you were, was not so bad as it happens. Needlessly
switcing films or chemistry will only confuse the learning process.. I have
made these mistakes too many times.
However, when you do understand your chosen products, and want to do
something specific that you can not do with those that you are using, then
experimentation has a purpose and i believe, will be far more constructive.
Having said all that i am using DiXactol myself... but for specific reasons.
Scott.

Jon,

You are searching for the holy grail of photography.  Some end up on this
quest, hoping  to find the perfect developer.  Your question is a very
good one, worthy of consideration.


Seriously though, stick with the developers you are using.  Ilfosol will
give fine grain (at the expense of film speed and a slight loss in
sharpness) and ID11 is a very versatile all-around developer, with a
chemical formulation that is nearly the same as D-76, often regarded as
the standard against which other developers that are being introduced
into the marketplace are compared.


You can find out more about DiXactol at the following website:

<<http://website.lineone.net/~barry-thornton/b_thornton_logo_banner.htm>


Barry Thornton posts to this list frequently, so he is perhaps the most
able to answer your question.  I will give you the shorter, descriptive
version.  He and others can fill in with more details if necessary.  


DiXactol can be used as a single or two bath developer.  Using it as a
single bath developer is much the same as what you are accustomed to
using with your present developers.  In my opinion, you will not gain
anything over what you are already using with DiZactol as a single bath
developer, and it is more expensive to purchase. 


Divided development is tolerant of slight differences in exposure on a
roll of film.  It also has a compensating effect.  The first bath is
where the developing agent, preservative and restrainer are.  The film is
left standing in that bath, allowing the developer to be absorbed by the
emulsion.  Not very much actual development occurs, because the pH is too
low to activate the developer.  The film is given mild agitation to make
sure that the developer is uniformly available on the surface of the
film.


The film is then transferred to the second bath without rinsing, and left
there without agitation.  Highlight areas on the negative develop quickly
(they go dark on the negative), and exhaust the developer in those areas.
 Shadow areas continue to develop longer, because the developer is
exhausted less quickly in those areas.  Temperature and time for the
development process are not critical.  The "compensating effect" of this
process gives proportionally more development in the shadow and midtone
areas than in the highlights.


DiXactol also has the ability to stain the film.  It actually looks a
different colour on the light table.  Stains usually produce green, brown
or yellow colours, depending on their chemical formulation.  A group of
developing agents in the catechol-pyrogallol families are capable of
doing this.  You may have heard of "pyro" developers -- they are also
staining developers.  In the early 1900's, these developers were de
rigeur in photography.  Staining works proportionally higher in those
areas that have received the most exposure.  The stain alters contrast
and helps to conceal the film's grain.  Staining developers like PMK
pyro, and rollo pyro are coming back into vogue.  


Now, back to my earlier mantra.  Stick with the processing you are using
now!  RThat's the best advice I can give you.  If you keep switching
films, developers, papers and other materials and techniques at an early
stage in photography, you will be doing yourself a disservice.  Do what
you are doing for at least a year, until you get to know how the
materials you are using are responding for you.  Then, if you dare go out
in search for the holy grail, be careful, because you may never find it,
and you may end up spending a great deal of time looking for it.

Yes there definitely is a definitive book on it:..;-)..

Tim Rudman's book on lith printing,
..and what is even better: Tim is on this list, and always very helpfull
should you have further questions, which I doubt, this book is
exhaustive and simply a must for every serious "lith printer"...;-)..

Best,

Cor.

Hi, 
I'm new to the list so please be patient with me for "butting in". I simply 
want to send a message of complete support to Ed,re Camera and Darkroom 
update. I hope that Trish continues to improve. To other list members I would 
like to recommend Ed's magazine as being first class and well worth waiting 
for despite any delay.

You will find that Gold toner will give impressive results with lith prints
on any lith printable paper. They will all give a final colour of blue. The
eventual blue depends on the development and the exposure given to the
paper. Prints developed longer for a colder tone will give less bright
blues. Some papers will go through other colours before the final blue,
typically purples but can also even be reds, as with Transtar TP5 for
example. There is an intensification which you have observed, it does not
always have to be dramatic, indeed it commonly isn't.
I have not found any work done on testing archival effects at different
toning times but I would expect that as with selenium it will be
proportional to the degree of toning.

staining is not often a problem with gold toners in my experience - and I
use a great deal of gold toner - unless the toner is getting old or
exhausted, then it often will stain highlights a pale yellow with the
prolonged times necessary to get the desired colour.

If the print is either over fixed or under washed/hypocleared the gold
toners may cause bleaching of the highlights, and this can be very
considerable. I quite literally have never observed this in my own darkroom
but I have very often encountered it on workshops where washing facilities
cannot accommodate the large number of prints we sometimes generate - and it
has to be said, people are not always too careful about fixing times -
despite warnings!

The mechanism involved in gold toning is thought to be different to
selenium. Rather than replacement as with Se, gold probably coats the silver
with a colloid envelope which is translucent and gives the blue colour. Some
say it replaces the silver but I believe the coating explanation prevails.
Certainly if you gold tone and then Se tone, the Se will change the colour
to brown as the Se replaces the silver cor inside the gold translucent
envelope, and this is then irreversible if you take the print back to gold -
so it makes sense. (Hence I always advise using the Se first then the gold
in dual toning - not the other way round)
I hope this helps
Tim Rudman

> > > > Synopsis: The 12hr-ISBN-JPEG Project began December 30, 1994. A
`round-the-clock posting of sequenced hypermodern imagery from Brad Brace.
The hypermodern minimizes the familiar, the known, the recognizable; it
suspends identity, relations and history. This discourse, far from
determining the locus in which it speaks, is avoiding the ground on which
it could find support. It is trying to operate a decentering that leaves
no privilege to any center. 


                       The 12-hour ISBN JPEG Project        
                       -----------------------------
                          began December 30, 1994


  Pointless Hypermodern Imagery... posted/mailed every 12 hours... a
spectral, trajective alignment for the 00`s! A continuum of minimalist
masks in the face of catastrophe; conjuring up transformative metaphors
for the everyday... A poetic reversibility of exclusive events... 

	A post-rhetorical, continuous, apparently random sequence of
imagery...  genuine gritty, greyscale...  corruptable, compact,
collectable and compelling convergence. The voluptuousness of the grey
imminence: the art of making the other disappear. Continual visual impact;
an optical drumming, sculpted in duration, on the endless present of the
Net.

  An extension of the printed ISBN-Book (0-9690745) series... critically
unassimilable... imagery is gradually acquired, selected and re-sequenced
over time...  ineluctable, vertiginous connections. The 12hr dialtone... 

                           [ see ftp.idiom.com/users/bbrace/netcom/books ]

KEYWORDS: >> Disconnected, disjunctive, distended, de-centered,
   de-composed, ambiguous, augmented, ambilavent, homogeneous, reckless...
>> Multi-faceted, oblique, obsessive, obscure, obdurate...
>> Promulgated, personal, permeable, prolonged, polymorphous, provocative,
   poetic, plural, perverse, potent, prophetic, pathological, pointless...
>> Emergent, evolving, eccentric, eclectic, egregious, exciting,
   entertaining, evasive, entropic, erotic, entrancing, enduring,
   expansive...

	Every 12 hours, another!...  view them, re-post `em, save `em,
trade `em, print `em, even publish them... 

Here`s how:

~ Set www-links to ->  http://www.teleport.com/~bbrace/12hr.html
                   ->  http://bbrace.laughingsquid.net/12hr.html

  Look for the 12-hr-icon. Heavy traffic may require you to specify files
  more than once! Anarchie, Fetch, CuteFTP, TurboGopher...

  (There are also usenet image browsers: TIFNY, PluckIt, Picture Agent,
    PictureView, Extractor97, NewsRover, Binary News Assistant, EasyNews) 

~ This interminable, relentless sequence of imagery began in earnest on
December 30, 1994. The basic structure of the project has been over
twenty-four years in the making. While the specific sequence of
photographs has been presently orchestrated for more than 12 years` worth
of 12-hour postings, I will undoubtedly be tempted to tweak the ongoing
publication with additional new interjected imagery. Each 12-hour posting
is like the turning of a page; providing ample time for reflection,
interruption, and assimilation. 

~ The sites listed above also contain information on other cultural
projects and sources. 

~ A very low-volume, moderated mailing list for announcements and
occasional commentary related to this project has been established 
at topica.com /subscribe 12hr-isbn-jpeg

This project has not received government art-subsidies. Some opportunities
still exist for financially assisting the publication of editions of large
(33x46") prints; perhaps (Iris giclees) inkjet extended-black quadtones on
newsprint! Other supporters receive rare copies of the first three
web-offset printed ISBN-Books.

Perhaps.  But I've seen this ploy used in other magazine startup situations.  
Over the years, I've been bombarded by such offers, and I'd say about 10% of 
them clearly omit such information.  It's a marketing strategy.  And, if it's 
an oversight, then they're bordering on incompetent......not good people to 
be investing your money in.

The magazine (p. 59) says bi-monthly.  One shouldn't expect more from a
startup magazine.  US subscription price is $24.95.

The web page http://www.hastpublishing.com gives an email address to the
subscriptions department of pwsubmail@aol.com.   Pehaps they could answer
questions about international availability.

Pete,  And how do you make that assessment? Do you know the editorial staff?
Perhaps it was an over site?

The best book on photographic chemistry that I know of is "Modern Photographic
Processing" in two volumes by Grant Haist, pub. John Wiley, 1979.   The book
is moderately technical, but you don't need to be a chemist to understand it. 
It is unfortunately long out of print.  Perhaps it be found via an out-of-print
book search or at a university library.

Toning is chapter 3 in volume 2.

Tim.
Many thanks for your help. It has been exciting seeing what is possible
with Kentona and Gold. (I have used Process lith with Se for a long time,
but never with Gold). The thing besides the color that amazed me was the
huge intensification of not just the shadows but midtones as well. In
waiting for the "blue" the image can really block up. I have ended up
pulling the print with barely a black in it, Se. toning for intensification,
and
extra warmth, and then Gold toning for intense blues, and still further
intensification. You might not like the blue, but to see so much from one
piece of paper is exciting!!

I still wonder if there is any literature anywhere, that deals with the
chemistry of the various photographic processes. Not in heavy detail,
but the kind of practical information that would indicate how long HCA
(Sodium Sulphite) should last as a stock solution, for example.
This may be a silly example, but I have no idea whether it is still as
effective
after a given period of time as when first mixed. And then should prints
be returned to HCA post toning?
Although I want to know yes or no, I would also like to understand why.
Hence my quest for a book on such subjects.

Many thanks
Scott.

Ive just toned a large RC print I made last night,
unfortunately I was using undersized trays and
seesawing the prints through, not ideal I know!!  One
of the prints had too long in one place and now has a
thin yellow stain line across the full width of the
print (toner tide line), is there anything I can do to
save it?

Im not sure what brand or composition toner I was using
I made it up a while ago and binned the factory
bottles, but its one of the odourless types, two bath.

Thanks

Jason Hall

Yes, print it again and stop working that way or you will have that kind of problem very often. Triying to save up cost a lot more.

*****************
It is, and you will find that with Process Lith in Gold will give a slightly
more pastel blue in the mid and high tones if previously Se toned for the
low values, than it does if just gold toned alone. (The brown shadows will
initially be retained in gold even without Se, but will convert to blue
eventually)

It has a very short life. Not worth saving once mixed. The unmixed shelf
life is usually supplied and may vary a bit with formulation etc.

And then should prints

***************8
According to Kodak, HCA speeds up final wash after Se - or at least KRST -
not only because it (KRST) contains much amm. Thiosulphate but they tell me
it also helps re selenium. I don't know what evidence there is for this as
they didn't give me any reference.

I agree. You could try a salvalge but better to do it again and learn from
the experience

  Unfortunately, this is a _very_ hard book to find. A search of on-line
library catalogues locally shows one copy at the University of California
at Santa Barbara.  I believe it is available in a photocopy edition for
around $150. I found the photocopy edition in an Amazon search. I wonder
how much noise it would take to get the publisher to reprint it.

The reason i was wondering was because Washaid is expensive, and when
toning, I can get through it at an alarming rate.
Steve Anshell lists 200gm Sodium Sulphite in 1 Litre as a stock soln,
to be diluted 1:10 for use. As far as I can tell it works as well, in
a third of the time Ilfords Washaid advises. As stock soln., should it
last a day, a week?, a month? And/or is there any additive that will
help preserve it without compromising the purpose of the solution.

And then in connection with the issue of HCA amidst multiple toning,
as a habit I tend to err on the side of caution, and return prints to
the HCA post fix, post thiocarbamide, post selenium etc. Is this
necessary at every stage?
Some say they mix HCA with the Se. toner. Is this wise?
Naturally, any way of shortening the amount of time processing a print
would be a TRULY WONDERFUL THING.

Thanks for your help.
Scott.

At risk of further highlighting my ignorance I'd like
to plumb the depths of the collective knowledge on
toning in general.  Ive used Sepia kits rarely in the
past with mixed results, I know the end result is
dependant on paper, processing etc but I seem to get
fairly random results.  It seems that Selenium is the
preferred toner but doesnt it give a light reddish
tone?

How far to bleach the print?  Is it best to bleach the
print all the way out or just partially.  Whats the
theory behind the level of bleaching?  I dont really
understand what the bleach is doing chemically, Id be
interested to have an understanding of this.

I like to have a deep chocolate tone which I sometimes
get with sepia, though mostly on low key subjects and
then unpredictably, should I just be using a warm tone
paper?  Overall lower density prints tend to come out
light reddish/brown through the highlights which Im not
keen on.

Any good books with examples on toning?

Thanks for any feedback

Jason

Jason and Scott (and who knows, maybe others?)
You may possibly be interested in the following link to Photo Art
International (bimonthly)
http://www.amphot.co.uk/content/creatmono/cm2.htm

I have been writing a big series on toning in PAI for some time now (- just
about to start number 10, so that is nearly 2 years)

Please note, I have no commercial interest in PAI and am not trying to sell
you anything! I do try to support what the editor is trying to achieve - a
predominantly image based publication with 'workshop' sections. You may find
some answers to your questions there in rather more length than I could give
here (- probably about 30,000 words plus pics)

Hope it helps

Tim

You (and others?) might also be interested in the articles I've penned about
toning (esp. split-toning) for The World Journal of Post-Factory Photography
/ Issue#3.  (mailto:jseigel@panix.com).  It's a fringe sort of publication,
but contains first-class photo content, especially as it pertains to
alternate sorts of photographic processes.

Hope this helps - Jon

  A formula which is pretty close to Kodak's is:

Wash Aid

Water						750.0 ml
Sodium Sulfite, anhydrous		100.0 grams
Sodium bisulfite				 25.0 grams
Tetra sodium EDTA				  5.0 grams
Sodium Citrate				  5.0 grams
Water to make				  1.0 liter

Dilute 1 part stock to 4 parts water for use.

The saturation point for Sodium Sulfite anhydrous is about 270 grams/liter
at 70F

Sulfite absorbs oxygen becoming sulfate in the process. It is used in
photography mostly as an anti-oxidant and preservative although it has
other important functions in developers. 
  Its function in wash aid is as an ion exchange medium. It displaces
thiosulfate ions and ions of fixing reaction products allowing much faster
wash times, especially where an aluminum sulfate hardener has been used. 
  The bisulfite in the wash aid is to buffer the mixture to near neutral pH
so as to reduce emulsion swelling to a minimum. The EDTA is probably to aid
in getting everything into solution and is a sequestering agent for calcium
and other metals which show up in tap water. The citrate becomes citric
acid in solution. It is another sequestering agent. The presense of these
two may also have some function in accelerating washing.
  Sulfite solutions have limited lifetimes by their nature since they
absorb oxygen rapidly. The more concentrated the solution the longer the
lifetimes.  Kodak gives a shelf life of three months for Kodak Hypo
Clearing Agent stock solution. The diluted working solution has a life of a
few hours. The sulfate does no damage but is probably not effective as a
wash aid.
  The purpose of using a wash aid before selenium toning is to adjust the
pH of the print. A print in acid condition may cause a yellow stain. The
acid reacts with KHCA to leave a deposit of elemental Selenium on the
print. Any mildly alkaline bath will serve to prevent this. The two most
often recommended are a 2% sodium carbonate solution or a 2% Kodalk solution. 
  The idea of diluting KHCA in wash aid is a way of saving time by
combining a toning and wash aid step. This works only when the KHCA is
highly diluted, 1:20 or more. Since the capacity of a highly diluted
solution of KHCA is pretty limited the short life of the wash aid is
probably not a problem. If you intend to use the stuff again dilute it with
plain water.
IMHO, KHCA working solutions should always be diluted with plain water.  
  Since KHCA contains a large amount of ammonium thiosulfate prints which
have been toned in it should be treated as though they had been fixed. This
is the reason for the KHCA treatment after toning. However, since the toner
does not have hardener in it the step may not be necessary where a
non-hardening fixer has been used. 
  Note that the alkaline bath also has some effect in accelerating washing,
but it is not as effective as sulfite since the ion exchange action is
either missing or less. 
  I also refer you to the Abbey newsletter page at the Conservation On Line
site http://www.palimpsest.stanford.edu do a name search for Nishimura and
read the stuff that comes up. It turns out that the use of highly diluted
KHCA is _not_ an effective protectant of the image silver and other toners
are more suitable. Toning in KHCA works for image protection provided the
solution is at least 1:9 or stronger and toning is carried out for at least
3 minutes at 68F.
  Selenium split tones affecting the finer grains in the denser portions of
the print or film first. Highly diluted toner may not tone the coarser
grains in the less dense area enough to protect them from oxidation. 
  A toner like Kodak Brown Toner tones everything evenly and provides
substantial protection for film or prints. It must not be used in high
dilution because its action is faster for high dilutions, or when partially
exhausted. At room temparature toning is fairly slow so its possible to
tone just slightly. Any toning which is visible will protect the image.
  Toning should be folowed by a "stop bath" in stock KHCA or its equivalent
in sulfite. The print is then washed. It is important when using a
polysulfide toner, like Kodak Brown Toner, to wash quickly at first to
avoid the further toning by the remaining toner, which, as the wash water
dilutes it, tones faster. Toning in very dilute Brown toner will leave
permanent peach or yellow stains in the highlights. The purpose of the wash
aid stop bath is to eliminate this problem. 
  Prints which have been toned in an indirect sepia toner probably do not
need any further treatment before washing.
  Note that a print _fully_ toned in either a sepia (sulfiding) toner or in
Selenium is very permenant. Silver selenide is as stable as silver sulfide,
the problem is the uneven toning whan only partial selenium toning is done.
  We are lucky to have Tim Rudman among us, he is probably the world's
champion expert on toning. I will bow to any corrections he may have to the
above.

P-S,
If I make up a batch ilford rapid fixer at 1+4, can I use it for film and
paper.   Over six months ago, I made a batch of fixer, long over due.  When
I disposed of the fixer, there was a lot of silver, left in the bottle.  Can
I reuse the bottle or is it pretty much trash.

Thanks
John Kufrovich

Question to DiXactol users:

I just got the DiXactol from photographers' formulary...

Am I correct that the normal dilution is 1+7+300 ?
If that so, it seems Solution B will soon be used up before
solution A since both A/B come in same volume in its kit

Am I miss something ?


Mr. Cheng

Sorry for the delay in replying I have been away from my workshop on a
teaching project.
You are quite right that the single bath option of DiXactol does use the
solutions disproportionately. Here in the UK I solve that problem by selling
a double pack of the B concentrate for the same price, and information on
that goes out with the DiXactol orders. In fact, there is a discount for
people who take up the offer within 30 days. Many do.
I have informed Photographers' Formulary of this in the past, but how they
market, I am afraid, is their decision, not mine. I will chase them again
about this because it is common sense as a user service, and, let's face it,
it is extra business too!
Might I suggest you specifically request a double pack of the B solution
from them in the interim.

Can somebody please let me know the merits of using a developer such as
DiXactol.
I am a complete beginner so please be careful with me. I am taking courses
at college and wish to start developing at home and need help.

The developer used at my college is either Ilford Ilfosol or ID11. Is
DiXactol much better than these? What properties does it have or not over
the Ilford developers?

Hi Jon
Sorry for the delay in replying - I have been away from my workshop for a
few days. No, DiXactol is not "better" than Ilfosol or ID11 - just
different. It is like saying "is a cello better than a saxophone?" They do
different things, and each human being will prefer one to the other for a
particular kind of music.
DiXactol, like pyro developers such as PMK, is a tanning and staining
developer. However, it can be used as a two bath as well as a single bath
developer. These features do give it an advantage over the two 'standard'
developers you mention in some circumstances. However, it is more demanding
in use.
It gives what I believe to be the sharpest results of any developer, and it
particularly resists the blocking of highlights in scenes with a high
subject brightness range. Grain, however, is more prominent than ID11/
Ilfosol in small format negatives.
My own suggestion would be learn using the standard types before branching
out. Then you will have a standard of comparison.
You don't mention the film you use. If it is FP4 Plus, Ilfosol gives
outstanding results. It is the developer of choice, as recommended by
Ilford's own technical data as giving the sharpest, finest grain, and best
overall image quality of their developers with this film. I can confirm that
this is my experience too.
Generally Ilfosol will give you the same speed as ID11 with any film,
greater sharpness, but slightly more prominent grain. For this reason,
Ilford favour this liquid developer for their slow and medium films. It is
not as happy with 'special grain' films like T-Max and Delta as with
conventional emulsions in my opinion.
In learning with either of these two developers, you will need to find out
how to judge subject brightness range, how to adjust film speed by cutting
it for high brightness ranges and increasing it for short ranges (a rare
occurrence I find), then cutting development for the lowered film speed and
increasing it for the raised film speed. The amount of speed/development
increase/decrease is the knowledge to be acquired.
My web site will give you full information about DiXactol, some other
interesting two bath formulae, and about finding your true film speed and
correct development time with any film/developer combination. You will find
it on www.barrythornton.com (note: NOT my old site which was
http://website.lineone.net/~barry-thornton/b_thornton_logo_banner.htm).
If you would care to send me your snail mail address by emailing me direct,
I will mail you copies of UK magazine articles which describe the way
DiXactol works.
Hope that helps.

Jon,
You are searching for the holy grail of photography. Some end up on this
quest, hoping to find the perfect developer. Your question is a very good
one, worthy of consideration.

Seriously though, stick with the developers you are using. Ilfosol will give
fine grain (at the expense of film speed and a slight loss in sharpness) and
ID11 is a very versatile all-around developer, with a chemical formulation
that is nearly the same as D-76, often regarded as the standard against
which other developers that are being introduced into the marketplace are
compared.

You can find out more about DiXactol at the following website:
<http://website.lineone.net/~barry-thornton/b_thornton_logo_banner.htm>

Please note - this web site is now obsolete. The up-to-date info is on
www.barrythornton.com

Barry Thornton posts to this list frequently, so he is perhaps the most able
to answer your question. I will give you the shorter, descriptive version.
He and others can fill in with more details if necessary.

DiXactol can be used as a single or two bath developer. Using it as a single
bath developer is much the same as what you are accustomed to using with
your present developers. In my opinion, you will not gain anything over what
you are already using with DiZactol as a single bath developer, and it is
more expensive to purchase.

It is more expensive than ID11, but not, I think, than Ilfosol when DiXactol
is used as single bath. Also, it does have an advantage in single bath - it
is the sharpest developer you can get. However, it is also grainier and more
'fussy' in use.

Divided development is tolerant of slight differences in exposure on a roll
of film. It also has a compensating effect. The first bath is where the
developing agent, preservative and restrainer are. The film is left standing
in that bath, allowing the developer to be absorbed by the emulsion. Not
very much actual development occurs, because the pH is too low to activate
the developer. The film is given mild agitation to make sure that the
developer is uniformly available on the surface of the film.

The film is then transferred to the second bath without rinsing, and left
there without agitation. Highlight areas on the negative develop quickly
(they go dark on the negative), and exhaust the developer in those areas.
Shadow areas continue to develop longer, because the developer is exhausted
less quickly in those areas.

To this with DiXactol you can add the very great tanning action which is
also proportionately stronger in the highlights, and which further restrains
their becoming too dense by restricting access of the developer to the
silver halides. Partial 'stand' development in the single bath solution also
mimics the effect of two bath incidentally.


 Temperature and time for the development process are not critical. The
"compensating effect" of this process gives proportionally more development
in the shadow and midtone areas than in the highlights.
DiXactol also has the ability to stain the film. It actually looks a
different colour on the light table. Stains usually produce green, brown or
yellow colours, depending on their chemical formulation. A group of
developing agents in the catechol-pyrogallol families are capable of doing
this. You may have heard of "pyro" developers -- they are also staining
developers. In the early 1900's, these developers were de rigeur in
photography. Staining works proportionally higher in those areas that have
received the most exposure. The stain alters contrast and helps to conceal
the film's grain. Staining developers like PMK pyro, and rollo pyro are
coming back into vogue.

Now, back to my earlier mantra. Stick with the processing you are using now!
RThat's the best advice I can give you. If you keep switching films,
developers, papers and other materials and techniques at an early stage in
photography, you will be doing yourself a disservice. Do what you are doing
for at least a year, until you get to know how the materials you are using
are responding for you. Then, if you dare go out in search for the holy
grail, be careful, because you may never find it, and you may end up
spending a great deal of time looking for it.

I completely agree with this last paragraph George. It is what people told
me 45 years ago when I started where Jon is now. It made sense then, and it
makes sense now. I still ignored it though and had a lot of fun doing so!
Barry Thornton

  BTW, you can silver plate pennies by soaking them in old fixer.
  The best cleaner is the old chromic acid one as used on lab glassware for
years. However both its components, potassium dichromate and sulfuric acid,
are hazardous and carcinogens.
  A bath in household bleach (like Clorox) followed by fresh hypo and a
water wash should work pretty well to dissolve the metallic silver and
remove it. It should also remove any sulfide which might have developed
there.

I wanted to take a moment and direct your attention to the
"Photographic Myths Part II" article by Bruce Barnbaum in the Sep/Oct issue
of Photo Techniques. He makes the case for placing high tonal values well
above Zone XIII and sometimes above Zone X, using N- development.

He's right on the money, in my experience, and this little bit of wisdom
often goes unheeded by any number of people desparate to get their image
to fit inside 10 zones or so.  I highly commend this article to you
zone practioners.

It is interesting to note that similar advice was dispensed years ago
by Fred Picker in one of his newsletters.  As I recall, he claimed
that there was no naturally occuring range of light (except perhaps
for subjects backlit by the sun) which could exceed the dynamic range
of a piece of film.  (I always thought this was about 15 stops, but Barnbaum
claims its more like 18.)  Therefore, he argued that the shadows always
be placed on Zone III and let the highlights fall wherever they wanted -
the film would manage to hold tonal detail which could then be retrieved
by burning during the printing process.  Barnbaum's approach more-or-less
parallels this except that he (rightly, IMHO) chooses N- development to
make the burning process more manageable in the darkroom.  For the record,
another interesting way to achieve this result (one which I prefer) is
to place the negative for detail on Zone III, but N develop with pyro which
naturally has a "compensating" effect on the higher values in the image.
However, I have had cases where I both had to do N- development and use
pyro.

Picker was/is (has anyone talked to him lately?) a stongly opionated fellow
with a penchant for marketing his Zone VI products.  He took a lot of heat
from any number of self-appointed experts for departing from pure Zone System
doctrine as originally explicated by St. Ansel.  For all of his marketing
stories, Picker made zone system more approachable than anyone I read when
I was first learning this stuff.  I still recomend his "Zone VI Workshop"
book as a starting point for beginners, because it is close enough to work
for most people, most of the time.  Much of what I wrote earlier this year
in the Camera & Darkroom article on zone system testing is grounded in what
I learned from Picker many years ago.

So, let's get out there and roast some film at Zones IX-XVIII (VXII if you
start from Zone 0 ;))))

Kodak has a film that appears to satisfy your request: Duplicating film SO-132,
available in 4x5 and 8x10 sheets. See:
http://www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/support/techPubs/f11/f11.shtml

I have never tried it.

As always Richard has given a masterly synopsis, although I think you have
(unusually) a recurring typo Richard - stating KHCA where sometimes you
meant KRST.

Richard, you are as generous with your compliments as you are with your
knowledge - but in this case too generous. The only thing I would disagree
with is your last statement and i certainly wouldn't make any such claim [or
any other for that matter ;-) ]

Using HCA type products does certainly add an expense to your processing.
The prices and the keeping times do vary a lot though. Richard has quoted
tyhe keeping times for the Kodak product as 3 months in concentrate and
hours  at working strength. I have a case of Ilford Washaid in my darkroom
right now and this is quite expensive - even more so given that it is to be
used at 1+4, so a litre bottle only gives you 4 L of working solution.
HOWEVER, the keeping time is stated to be 48 months in full tightly
stoppered bottles and 6 months even in partially full tightly stoppered
bottles. Even the made up 1+4 solution is said to last 7 days. I also have a
case of Fotospeed Wash Aid and this is much cheaper - even more so as 1L
stock makes 10L working solution, but I believe its keeping properties are
less. They are not quoted on the bottles. So you see, there is considerable
variation.

It is certainly worth using if selenium toning and if multiple toning with
FB papers. I would also recommend using it with FB papers that are to be
toned in any toner that uses a bleach - such as sepia, blue, copper. FSA,
iron green etc. If you don't clear all the fixer out of the paper it may
react with the bleach to form irreversible 'Farmers' type products
(depending on the nature of the bleach) and you will get unnecessary loss of
highlight detail.

Mixing HCA (etc) with Se toner is interesting. Richard has explained the
rationale for this and it was favoured by AA as everybody knows. However
research has shown that the archival properties of this combination are less
for a given time in the solution than if the products are used separately.
Also Se has a very long self life even when diluted whereas HCA etc has a
very short life - so it seems a pointless way of working to me except that
it saves a bit of time - but even this is not a factor if you organise your
d'room efficiently with archival slot washers and even slot HCA holding
units as it all goes on in the background whilst you do the next print.

The popularity of Se for 'archivalling'  is probably because it produces
little or no colour change when used this way, plus of course the desirable
Dmax enhancement, and many workers do not want the colour shifts given by
sulphide toning. Gold works well but is expensive. However it now seems that
the archival protection of dilute SE has been considerably over estimated.
Interestingly even 'full' SE toning with stronger solutions and _very_
extended toning times does not convert all the large grains even in the
darker tones where it works first, and this of course is the basis of the so
called 'Chinese prints' (named after China Hamilton)

Richard touched on Hardeners. I would suggest not using them if planning to
tone.

I wanted to take a moment and direct your attention to the
"Photographic Myths Part II" article by Bruce Barnbaum in the Sep/Oct issue
of Photo Techniques. He makes the case for placing high tonal values well
above Zone XIII and sometimes above Zone X, using N- development.

He's right on the money, in my experience, and this little bit of wisdom
often goes unheeded by any number of people desparate to get their image
to fit inside 10 zones or so.  I highly commend this article to you
zone practioners.

It is interesting to note that similar advice was dispensed years ago
by Fred Picker in one of his newsletters.  As I recall, he claimed
that there was no naturally occuring range of light (except perhaps
for subjects backlit by the sun) which could exceed the dynamic range
of a piece of film.  (I always thought this was about 15 stops, but Barnbaum
claims its more like 18.)  Therefore, he argued that the shadows always
be placed on Zone III and let the highlights fall wherever they wanted -
the film would manage to hold tonal detail which could then be retrieved
by burning during the printing process.  Barnbaum's approach more-or-less
parallels this except that he (rightly, IMHO) chooses N- development to
make the burning process more manageable in the darkroom.  For the record,
another interesting way to achieve this result (one which I prefer) is
to place the negative for detail on Zone III, but N develop with pyro which
naturally has a "compensating" effect on the higher values in the image.
However, I have had cases where I both had to do N- development and use
pyro.

Picker was/is (has anyone talked to him lately?) a stongly opionated fellow
with a penchant for marketing his Zone VI products.  He took a lot of heat
from any number of self-appointed experts for departing from pure Zone
System
doctrine as originally explicated by St. Ansel.  For all of his marketing
stories, Picker made zone system more approachable than anyone I read when
I was first learning this stuff.  I still recomend his "Zone VI Workshop"
book as a starting point for beginners, because it is close enough to work
for most people, most of the time.  Much of what I wrote earlier this year
in the Camera & Darkroom article on zone system testing is grounded in what
I learned from Picker many years ago.

So, let's get out there and roast some film at Zones IX-XVIII (VXII if you
start from Zone 0 ;))))

Hi Tim
Sounds about right to me too. The only problem with this approach - the 'all
the detail is there in the negative and you can burn it in when printing'
theme - is that frequently the highlights are sandwiched between mid or
shadow tone image detail. It is impossible to burn in the amount needed for
the highlights without halos appearing on the mid/shadow tone areas. I see
some terrible prints from people who expound this method who just seem to
close their eyes to this 'dark spread'. Often the highlights are so small
and scattered all over an image that burning in is practically impossible.
As a landscape photographer and teacher, those prints which I tend to see of
this kind frequently exhibit trees crossing horizons which are grey at the
base, but black at the top. Similarly, hills and mountains always seem to
have dark summits ridges and peaks where the sky has been burned in.
Also, while film will hold detail into these higher zones, the
characteristic curve does roll off, and separation does decrease. Burned in
extreme highlights like this also tend to be mottled, and grain is prominent
with small and medium formats. The current fad for burning in with VC soft
grades, often to lessen the dark halo overspill effect, lessens the
prominent grain, but makes for even worse separation and muddy tones.
For delicate separation in the highlights the N-1 approach is usually almost
required as standard in landscape work - in landscape clouds for instance -
and a tanning developer like PMK (or DiXactol!) or a metol two bath, helps
further.
The trouble is that the ground area's local contrast is reduced by this
approach of course. However, it is much easier and more effective to step up
printing contrast for these areas of the image, and to burn in the sky a
little at normal grade, than to print the ground areas at normal and
struggle to burn in highlights for longer periods.
It is also a fact that grain is reduced and sharpness increased by the
reduction in film development time.
The myth of the master printer, the darkroom magician, is fostered by the
ability to make a print from negatives with extreme highlights like this.
Techniques like paper preflashing, latent image prebleaching, soft print
bleaching etc. all cover up the basic point that these are a recovery
process for an ill-developed negative. With the same amount of effort
expended in printing a better exposed/developed negative, the final print
would be greatly superior.
If the printing technique is to use a tailored unsharp mask for the
negative, my argument for a fine negative falls down of course.

Barry Thornton

P.S.  Fred Picker's Zone VI Workshop is, I agree, a masterly exercise in
clarity.

Maybe, but I doubt it.  That silver plates-out pretty efficiently onto the 
glass - like a badly oxidized mirror.  You're certainly going to need the 
bottle brush but, as I recall from my last attempt at this - a good dose of 
hydrochloric (muriatic acid), soaking over night, seemed to work better than 
the bleach.  It's been a while.  Try one of the treatment techniques.  If it 
is too tedious, rinse with water and try the other.

Whilst I agree with you that a 'good' negative is unquestionably a better
starting point than is a bad one - and who could disagree with that - I
don't agree with your view that the above and many other techniques are only
'a recovery process'.
This is fine if what you want is a black and white print which shows the
scene as taken or possibly as visualised. There is nothing wrong with that,
but it isn't the whole story of course. Nobody can say that this is the
right or wrong way for a print to look (I'm not suggesting that you did
Barry). Photography is a recording process and can be used as a tool in any
way the artist - and I choose the word carefully - wants it to. Photography
is too broad to be confined by any persons view, or collections of persons
for that matter.
I use all the techniques you mention and a great many more besides. Mostly I
don't use them as rescue techniques. When I do it is because of either short
comings in the neg - which is my fault -or lighting (or lack of!) problems.
Mostly however I use them for artistic expression to get something that even
the perfect negative won't give me - because it goes beyond that. Indeed I
often see a picture in a scene that is not much like the scene at all, and
that is where a bit of darkroom magic is not only helpful but essential.
That is quite valid. The vast range of aclaimed photographic art bears
testament to that. It would be awful if we all produced the same without the
beauty of individual creativity.
Using these techniques is no different than using bromoil or many other
alternative creative processes, or bleaching, toning, hand colouring or
whatever it takes to express that creative need that drives us. Look at some
of the lovely work done using liquid emulsion mixed with sand and other
material to give it texture prior to toning and colouring. Not your way of
working or mine - but I'm glad people are doing it and 'photography' is the
richer for that (IMHO)
Tim  ;-)

Barry.
I was relieved to read your thoughts about the "squash it all on the
negative" approach, as in my experience this tends to ruin local
contrast through most of the tonal scale, which (for me at least)
results in unpleasantly flat and muddy print qualities. Little point
having so much information if the qualities of both light and shade
are sacrificed along the way.

I wonder if you could elaborate on the closing comments of your
response above.
Is the process of unsharp masking something you have experience of,
and if so, is it the great leap forward in terms of perceived
sharpness, and improved local contrasts, that some claim it to be?
Your comment suggests that a negative destined for unsharp masking
should be different, (I assume it should have greater contrast), is
this what you mean?

  Using my condenser enlarger last night, mind you this my second attempt at
printing @home, I had some quick printing times, around 2 seconds.  Other
than stopping down the lens further than 3 stops, what other methods are
there.  I was thinking either bulb replacement or some kind of voltage
regulator.

BTW, time really flies, almost watched the sun come up. :^)

Thanks

Over exposing, over developing, Neutral density filter, Polarizing filter.
larger print,  slower paper,  and...changing the bulb size.  Messing with
the electricity usually also means messing with the distribution of the
color of the light (making it more towards the yellow-red).  Doing so
introduces another variable.

What temperature is your developer?
Which paper, developer, lamp, enlarger, lens???
Are the negs more than thin?
Is it a point light source?
What size of film?

  Using my condenser enlarger last night, mind you this my second attempt at
printing @home, I had some quick printing times, around 2 seconds.  Other
than stopping down the lens further than 3 stops, what other methods are
there.  I was thinking either bulb replacement or some kind of voltage
regulator.

BTW, time really flies, almost watched the sun come up. :^)

Neutral density filters help a lot. They are quick and simple, and the
effect on exposure is exactly predictable. You can use camera filters below
the lens, or gel-type filters in the filter tray.

You can always use a neutral density filter, just like on your camera's lens.

  Two second printing times are too short, although they minimize the
effects of vibration. Ususally around 15 to 30 seconds is a convenient and
controllable time.

  The two ways of reducing illumination are to use a lower wattage lamp, if
the enlarger permits it. Or to use a neutral density filter in the light
path. The optical quality does not have to be too great if its used above
the condensers. 
  It would be helpful to know the make and type of enlarger and what kind
of paper you are using. 
  There are voltage regulators available. The "Sola" saturated reactor type
is often available surplus at reasonable cost. 
  Because of the very short exposures you may be getting errors from the
time the lamp takes to come on and fade out. While these times may be
consistent themselves they will be more or less significant depending on
the exposure time. For the "normal" range of time, which is 15 seconds or
longer, it makes little or no difference, for very short times it may make
a very significant difference.

 That explains why my post didn't show up. I thought it was a problem at
Netcom or with my machine and posted again. I was puzzled by not getting an
error message but obviously the post was only delayed a little. I now see
both posts on the list so sorry for double posting. 
  These things seem to happen on weekends, like broken timing belts.

Up - 'sorry 'bout that, but I wanted to get the OS upgrade out of the
way before I took off traveling for the week.  Everything should be OK
now, but if it is not, it may not be fixed until 8/21/2000.  Sorry to
inconvenience anyone if it breaks, but I may well not have remote
access next week...

Both bulb replacement and a voltage regulator would work.  The third thing you
could try is a Neutral density filter.

All great suggestions, especially the ND filters.  I was looking at the
voltage regulator and saying to myself that can't work to great, changes the
spectral output and color temperature.

The enlarger is an Omega c-67 w/ ph140(75w).  I was trying to print some 6x6
negs of my first trip to Yosemite, back in June.  I was using ilford cool
tone RC, 8x10 @20c.   All ilford standard (universal) chemicals.
The negs look great.

Thanks for the help
John

Barry:

Thank you very much for your reply. I, at least know that I am doing things
right(1+7+300 mixing ratio  ;-)

And, I certainly will request to buy double pack of Solution B as I intend
to use single bath option. (the reason I switch to DiXactol is that, as I
understand, produces rather Brown stains than yellow/green by PMK, which I
think is nice for using with VC papers)

I am still in the process testing N, N+, N- with DiXactol, hereby, some
questions, if you don't mind

--What I do--:
Films: Artisa 8x10-400 (believed to be Ilford HP5)
Film exposed with Kodak Step tablet
single sheet/tray development, continue agitation at 21"c/70"F
(4+28+1200 ml DiXactol solution)

Oriental VC-FB paper with Zone VI enlarger(the one that has
dual lamps, one green, one Blue)

I 'standardize' my normal contrast by setting both green/blue lamps
at Max. output on the Zone VI enlarger

So far, I have develop films up to 14.5 minutes and it appears to be
N-1 1/2, I am going to try 18 minutes(15 min. x 1.2) and 20 minutes....

My question is, as you know, how far can DiXactol goes? the instruction
says most likely we only need to develop film under 10 minutes.

(I understand the rather long developing time is due to Zone VI enlarger's
lamps, I have the same 'problem' when I used PMK)

Any input from Anyone is welcomed.

C.J. Cheng

Barry, a few years ago I was developing my FP4 negatives after a holiday in
the Lake district. I noticed that my first roll was very dense, I had
grossly overexposed all my films and the negs were just about unprintable. I
developed the next roll as per AA's instructions in The Negative, highly
dilute HC-110 with minimum agitation, to my surprise I was rewarded with
negatives that printed well on grade 2 Ilfobrom and with detailed quality
prints that I had never experienced before from 35mm negs.

In the Sept/Oct. 1999 View Camera magazine (available from Robert White) =
there was a very interesting article by Mark Citric in respect of the =
response of modern thin film emulsions to Zone system practice.

He came to the conclusion that thin film emulsions do not behave in the =
same way as the old 'thick' film emulsions of Adams day.
He found that N- development retarded the development of all values, not =
just the highlights. I have also noticed this phenomenen.

He now uses the following technique for N- developments.

Meter for zone 3 and place on Zone 5 or 6. Ignore where highlights fall.
Develop in Rodinal at 1:149 repeat 1:149 for about 12 minutes-note:-this =
technique may only work with Tmax100 and Rodinal combination.
This gives a printable negative. Goes against all Zone system teachings.

I have only had a chance so far to do one or two experiments but the =
results look very encouraging.

I expose Tmax.100 at 40ASA and develop for 9 minutes in a Combitank- 5 x =
4 sheet film.

Anybody else out there had experience of this technique?

He also attended workshops with Ruth Bernhard-is this the Bernhard =
referenced in the recent spate of e-mails?

Well I'm off to Portugal in the next hour or so and will look forward to =
any replies when I get back unless I find a cyber cafe and work out how =
to access my e-mail from abroad.

Bill Pierce wrote for Popular Photography back in the early '70s,
contributed to the Leica Manual, and was a working photojournalist.  Anybody
know if he is still active?  He was one of those prime sources actually
earning his keep as a photographer and yet sharing what he knew.

  In the Sept/Oct. 1999 View Camera magazine (available from Robert =
White) there was a very interesting article by Mark Citric in respect of =
the response of modern thin film emulsions to Zone system practice.

  He came to the conclusion that thin film emulsions do not behave in =
the same way as the old 'thick' film emulsions of Adams day.


      One other aspect to using TMax that isn't mentioned too often is =
its designed in 'extended red sensitivity'. This is supposed to make it =
act a lot like a normal film with a light yellow filter on it. It has =
the effect of exaggerating the blues in shadows, at least in our higher =
desert area. Put on a red filter & use the 'normal' filter factor and =
you find yourself with no shadow detail at all. You have to allow for =
this and add one to one and a half more stops of exposure as a result.

I don't know about the Omega c-67, but usually there is a light source
adjustment for different size negatives, either different mixing chamber or
change in bulb distance to condensor.  This is probably a dumb question, but
have you checked to see if the enlarger is set for 6x6?

Hi,
About one and a half week ago I asked the list about the AGFA APX400
film which gave me unsharp results when souped in Xtol. (I more or less
excluded unsharpness introduced by exposure). Both Barry Thornton and
Richard Ross advised me to try Rodinal as developer. This definitely
gave another "feel" to the resulting prints. Increased grain as
predicted, but also a different tonality and absolutely increased
apparent sharpness. Have to get more experience with this combo - at has
a certain "feel" from the past in it, for lack of a better description -

So thank you both (..and I will stick to my stock of APX400, sorry
Richard..;-)

Ps

I shot the film at 250 ASA in my Fuijca 645 folding camera.
Processed in Rodinal; 1+50 at 20 deg C for 11 minutes

Why is it that newer is not alway better. Ever since Digital Journal has updated to "Flash Player" on their website, I've been unable to access their
ezine. People don't realize there are people out on the internet that, for various reasons(mine being goverment restrictions), who can't download the
latest in softwear. So now , in the name of progress, I am refused access to some fine photo-writing. I can't even email a complaint as the address is
within the main website that is inaccessable.

Oh, one thing I forgot to ask in my previous post: is Rodinal giving a a
higher B+F than say Xtol 1:1 or D76 1:1. My first results with Rodinal
(1+50) seem to indicate this.

Thanks,

 In the Sept/Oct. 1999 View Camera magazine (available from Robert White)
there was a very interesting article by Mark Citric in respect of the
response of modern thin film emulsions to Zone system practice.
  
 He came to the conclusion that thin film emulsions do not behave in the
same way as the old 'thick' film emulsions of Adams day.
  
  
     One other aspect to using TMax that isn't mentioned too often is its
designed in 'extended red sensitivity'. This is supposed to make it act a
lot like a normal film with a light yellow filter on it. It has the effect
of exaggerating the blues in shadows, at least in our higher desert area.
Put on a red filter & use the 'normal' filter factor and you find yourself
with no shadow detail at all. You have to allow for this and add one to one
and a half more stops of exposure as a result.
  
 dan smith
  
   I presume by exagerate you mean that it reproduces the shadows darker
than normal film as it reproduces skys darker. I suspect the effect with a
red filter is made even stronger by the relatively short toe of T-Max films
which increases shadow contrast. 
  There are spectral response curves for Tri-X, T-Max, and Technical Pan in
the data sheets on the Kodak web site. One presumes that the response of
Plus-X and Ektapan are similar to Tri-X.
  Tech Pan has red responce extending somewhat further than most other
films, to 700nm rather than 650 as in Tri-X or T-Max. I find it tends to
give washed out skin tones which T-Max does not.

Hello every body,

    I have used a Hasselblad with 3 lens (50mm, 120mm and 80mm) for more
than 10 years and I am very happy with it and with the square format I like
a lot. The only problem is the weight of the total it is heavy and not so
pleasant when you have to travel. I am considering to replace it by a Mamiya
7 II with 2 lens (45mm + ? ) . I would like to know what are the pro and con
for the Mamiya 7 versus the Hasselblad if some one as some experience with
both. Many thanks

    Daniel

  Um...this isn't anything new; N- development is usually accompanied by a
lower EI.
  I think what he's found is that TMX doesn't need as much percentage
change in development time or dilution to effect the same amount of CI
change as do "conventional" films. For example, I've found that a five
percent change in TMX development time has about the same result as a 10 to
15-percent change with HP5+, a fairly conventional film.
  Another example is that if I use D-76 1:1 for N development of HP5+, I
can easily get N-3 by using D-76 1:3 and developing it for the 1:1 time and
giving a stop more exposure; otoh, the same treatment of TMX results in
very, very thin throwaway negs. A longer development time in D-76 1:3
brings TMX back up to "normal" N-3 or so.
  Otoh, Delta 100 acts the same as HP5+.

Tim Rudman replied:

Whilst I agree with you that a 'good' negative is unquestionably a better
starting point than is a bad one - and who could disagree with that - I
don't agree with your view that the above and many other techniques are only
'a recovery process'.
This is fine if what you want is a black and white print which shows the
scene as taken or possibly as visualised. There is nothing wrong with that,
but it isn't the whole story of course. Nobody can say that this is the
right or wrong way for a print to look (I'm not suggesting that you did
Barry). Photography is a recording process and can be used as a tool in any
way the artist - and I choose the word carefully - wants it to. Photography
is too broad to be confined by any persons view, or collections of persons
for that matter.
I use all the techniques you mention and a great many more besides. Mostly I
don't use them as rescue techniques. When I do it is because of either short
comings in the neg - which is my fault -or lighting (or lack of!) problems.
Mostly however I use them for artistic expression to get something that even
the perfect negative won't give me - because it goes beyond that. Indeed I
often see a picture in a scene that is not much like the scene at all, and
that is where a bit of darkroom magic is not only helpful but essential.
That is quite valid. The vast range of aclaimed photographic art bears
testament to that. It would be awful if we all produced the same without the
beauty of individual creativity.
Using these techniques is no different than using bromoil or many other
alternative creative processes, or bleaching, toning, hand colouring or
whatever it takes to express that creative need that drives us. Look at some
of the lovely work done using liquid emulsion mixed with sand and other
material to give it texture prior to toning and colouring. Not your way of
working or mine - but I'm glad people are doing it and 'photography' is the
richer for that (IMHO)
Tim  ;-)

My reply:

Tim,
The first thing I want to do is apologise. It is only when I got your reply
that I realised that my reference to "the master printer" may have made it
seem that I was aiming at your book with that phrase in the title. I most
definitely wasn't, either directly or indirectly. So sorry if it seemed I
attributed an unjustified approach to you. In fact I had somebody else
entirely in mind.
It is all the more unfortunate since we are not disagreeing. My slack use of
English meant that I must have given the impression that I was supporting
the Zone purists. I wasn't. My point was simply that film will record up to
15 or more zones. The problem is printing them.
Faced with a wide subject brightness range most in-built camera meters, no
matter what the wild claims made by advertisements, greatly underexpose.
They effectively try to average the shot, no matter what matrix metering is
claimed to achieve. Thus there are unpleasantly empty shadows in the print.
But it is not just a matter of camera meters. MOST of the work that I see at
workshops and in one-to-one coaching is underexposed EVEN BY PHOTOGRAPHERS
USING THE ZONE SYSTEM. This is caused by over-optimistic placing of shadow
areas on too low a zone.
No, the simple point I was making  was that a negative should have enough
exposure to place full shadow detail on zone III. The highlights can fall
where they will even up to zone XV or more. Normal development renders them
virtually unprintable however. Pulled development plus compensating or
tanning development will lead to rich satisfying prints however. For pretty
well all landscape work, I find an approximate N-1 development to be called
for because of the difference between the land and sky areas' brightness. It
is far easier and gives a better quality print to step up contrast in the
land areas, and to print skies or other highlights at something like a
'normal' grade than it is to print land areas at normal and be forced into
printing highlights at soft.
My basic philosophy is to expose enough and develop the least. Obviously,
there will be odd occasions where the subject brightness ratio is so low
that generous exposure and minimum development would yield too flat a
negative, but these occasions are actually pretty rare. The problem is that
our eyes and brain 'adjust' the brightness range of a scene as we scan it by
opening/closing the eye's iris, and in the brain's further processing the
information so received. We are often fooled into thinking that a scene is
flatter than it really is, and film will see it much more contrastily. For
genuinely flat scenes, I find 'normal' exposure and development entirely
adequate.
So I am not saying interpret scenes tone for tone, zone for zone, for
literal representation. That's neither possible nor desirable. My comments
do have great relevance to roll or 35mm film use where it usually isn't
possible to exert tight zone control. With the expose enough develop the
least doctrine, I believe such controls are unnecessary.
None of my comments have any bearing on whether one composes pictures in
camera or in the mind for later 'working up' in the darkroom. I actually
don't see any difference. If you visualise your final image at original
exposure, it makes no difference whether your visualisation is of a
'straight' full-toned print or one produced by various manipulative methods.
What I do believe to be true is that no amount of such manipulation will
create a strong picture if the original 'straight' image is weak.
You and I have our differences I know on our approach to the final image -
no problem with that, it's a productive difference - but my original message
had nothing to do with that. Honest!
I really was thinking about demonstrations I have frequently seen given
about getting a print from a hopelessly exposed and developed negative.
These are definitely recovery jobs, and are essentially treating symptoms.
The thousands of such negatives given normal development after exposure via
a camera meters arriving at my workshop to print over the years are a
testimony to that.
As an aside, a well proven method of debating is to attribute arguments to
the other debater that they never made, then proceed to shoot them down. It
is a method all too frequently used to attack zone purists. The claim is
that they want a literal sterile representation. It's not true of course. I
suppose there must be a few people out there who work this way. I'm not one
of them. Nor are the vast majority of Zone system workers. The sole purpose
of the zone system is to allow us to achieve the image we visualise
predictably, literal or otherwise.
Sorry once again Tim for the unintended slight.

I was relieved to read your thoughts about the "squash it all on the

contrast through most of the tonal scale, which (for me at least)
results in unpleasantly flat and muddy print qualities. Little point
having so much information if the qualities of both light and shade
are sacrificed along the way.

I wonder if you could elaborate on the closing comments of your
response above.
Is the process of unsharp masking something you have experience of,
and if so, is it the great leap forward in terms of perceived
sharpness, and improved local contrasts, that some claim it to be?
Your comment suggests that a negative destined for unsharp masking
should be different, (I assume it should have greater contrast), is
this what you mean?

Scott
Unsharp masking is an extremely effective technique. It is very much worth
trying, and there is an example in my forthcoming book due in October (spot
the subtle commercial plug). My experience is limited to a suck it and see
approach. Other users such as Howard Bond (?), and this list's very own
Chuck Downs, use a closely controlled technique with a densitometer and
camera film masks to adjust mask contrast range to fit the original
negative.
I use the slow Ilford Technical Ortho film under normal red safelighting in
the darkroom. You make test strips and process in print developer just like
paper. Exposure and development can be manipulated easily to produce
different densities and contrasts of mask. Also the spacing from the
original negative can be varied to give varying sharpness edge effects.
I don't use the technique enough to go to the trouble of working out a
methodical table of exposures and development times related to original
negative contrast. However, some workers give all original negatives full
development times regardless of subject brightness range, and adjust the
negatives via unsharp positive masks.
You pays your money and takes your choice. In your shoes I would definitely
play about with some of the Ilford film before deciding.

We'll have to start a club - Underdevelopers Anonymous. Spread the word.
People are so sceptical about it. There seems a compulsion to 'give it a
little more time in the developer to be sure'.

Barry, a few years ago I was developing my FP4 negatives after a holiday in
the Lake district. I noticed that my first roll was very dense, I had
grossly overexposed all my films and the negs were just about unprintable. I
developed the next roll as per AA's instructions in The Negative, highly
dilute HC-110 with minimum agitation, to my surprise I was rewarded with
negatives that printed well on grade 2 Ilfobrom and with detailed quality
prints that I had never experienced before from 35mm negs.

Thank you very much for your reply. I, at least know that I am doing things
right(1+7+300 mixing ratio  ;-)

And, I certainly will request to buy double pack of Solution B as I intend
to use single bath option. (the reason I switch to DiXactol is that, as I
understand, produces rather Brown stains than yellow/green by PMK, which I
think is nice for using with VC papers)

I am still in the process testing N, N+, N- with DiXactol, hereby, some
questions, if you don't mind

--What I do--:
Films: Artisa 8x10-400 (believed to be Ilford HP5)
Film exposed with Kodak Step tablet
single sheet/tray development, continue agitation at 21"c/70"F
(4+28+1200 ml DiXactol solution)

Oriental VC-FB paper with Zone VI enlarger(the one that has
dual lamps, one green, one Blue)

I 'standardize' my normal contrast by setting both green/blue lamps
at Max. output on the Zone VI enlarger

So far, I have develop films up to 14.5 minutes and it appears to be
N-1 1/2, I am going to try 18 minutes(15 min. x 1.2) and 20 minutes....

My question is, as you know, how far can DiXactol goes? the instruction
says most likely we only need to develop film under 10 minutes.

(I understand the rather long developing time is due to Zone VI enlarger's
lamps, I have the same 'problem' when I used PMK)

Any input from Anyone is welcomed.



Mr Cheng
Sorry I can't be too helpful about the ZoneVI head. I haven't used it. I am
sure other list members will have, and I am pretty sure that Les McLean here
in the UK has too. Maybe they could advise. I must say that I had not heard
of this kind of contrast drop with the head, and I am pretty suspicious
about it. It is much more likely that underdevelopment is taking place. By
10 minutes you should be getting pretty contrasty negatives with HP5 Plus in
DiXactol.
If your dilutions are correct, and the temperature is accurate, I would be
questioning the freshness of the developer. Is the part A concentrate a pale
straw colour, or is it a stronger tint?

About one and a half week ago I asked the list about the AGFA APX400
film which gave me unsharp results when souped in Xtol. (I more or less
excluded unsharpness introduced by exposure). Both Barry Thornton and
Richard Ross advised me to try Rodinal as developer. This definitely
gave another "feel" to the resulting prints. Increased grain as
predicted, but also a different tonality and absolutely increased
apparent sharpness. Have to get more experience with this combo - at has
a certain "feel" from the past in it, for lack of a better description -

So thank you both (..and I will stick to my stock of APX400, sorry
Richard..;-)

Ps

I shot the film at 250 ASA in my Fuijca 645 folding camera.
Processed in Rodinal; 1+50 at 20 deg C for 11 minutes

Hi all,

I've just written an article on an intro to shooting Infrared film for
HandColor.com. I would like those interested to give it a once over and
comment if they feel so inclined.

I'm certainly no writer (I tend to be more visual. Who would have thought.
:-)) but this is more to help those who haven't had a chance to try IR film
to do so.



You can find the article at:

Sincerely,

  Indeed this is all obvious from the Kodak data sheets. Where most films
will change one paper grade in contrast with a change of about 30 to 33% in
development time, T-Max yields the same chang with about 20% change. 
 As a rule for nearly any film a one paper grade change in contrast
requires about 3/4 stop change in speed if the highlight densities are to
be kept the same. Lower development = less speed. 
  Published data indicate most pictorial film is capable of a gamma range
of from about 0.4 to 1.0 by varying time and probably more by choice of
developer and dilution.  
  Mostly contrast is specified now as "contrast index" to account for the
different H&D curve shapes of film. The aim point for "normal" negatives
and for the ISO speed method seems to be around CI=.65 for diffusion
printing. CI and gamma are identical for a straight line portion of the
curve.

Barry, no offence was taken at all.
In fact I didn't even think of the connection re 'master printer' and my
books until I read your apology below - it really wasn't necessary, but
thanks for being so considerate.
I really wanted to widen the debate because as you know I have a different
view to yours about what is acceptable in photography, and I thought it
would be enlightening to see what views others had. [Judging by the complete
lack of response I was obviously wrong ! ;-) ]
I'm all for a 'broad church' approach personally, which I find stimulating.
Tim

 Interestingly, I think some of my printing skills came from struggling with
overdeveloped negs as a result of getting exactly this bad  ' give it a bit
extra' advice years ago when I was starting! So it is an ill wind...etc
I used to be up night after night finding ways to make the print as I wanted
it from these negs.
It seems almost too easy sometimes these days!

i have a collection of photography books- well over 500- and probably worth 
over 50,000- does anyone know of a source other than e bay in which i can 
sell these- i have already investigated sothebys and christies and argosy-

Don, I let it go fo a while.  There is text mixed with photos, my netscape
had a time decoding.  I stopped it to see the text and some pictures half
loaded and many waiting to be loaded.

I haven't read the article yet, but i do have a box of 4x5 from Cachet of
the Maco film to try.  I have shot their 127 size  100 speed film.  It was
fine, so I'm sure this film will also perform well.

What does this mean, "exaggerating the blues?"  In B&W does that mean it
makes them lighter, or darkens them.  It would become, I would imagine a
green to photograph a blue tulip, for example, with a yellow filter.

What do you call 'exaggerate' here with this example?

I would contact Rix Reed at Photo Eye and let him make you an offer.  Perhaps
with that many a consignment might be possible.

It's exactly the Zone system teaching.  Plus expose, expand develop in a =

  In the Sept/Oct. 1999 View Camera magazine (available from Robert =
White) there was a very interesting article by Mark Citric in respect of =
the response of modern thin film emulsions to Zone system practice.

  He came to the conclusion that thin film emulsions do not behave in =
the same way as the old 'thick' film emulsions of Adams day.
  He found that N- development retarded the development of all values, =
not just the highlights. I have also noticed this phenomenen.

  He now uses the following technique for N- developments.

  Meter for zone 3 and place on Zone 5 or 6. Ignore where highlights =
fall.
  Develop in Rodinal at 1:149 repeat 1:149 for about 12 =
minutes-note:-this technique may only work with Tmax100 and Rodinal =
combination.
  This gives a printable negative. Goes against all Zone system =
teachings.

  I have only had a chance so far to do one or two experiments but the =
results look very encouraging.

  I expose Tmax.100 at 40ASA and develop for 9 minutes in a Combitank- 5 =
x 4 sheet film.

  Anybody else out there had experience of this technique?

  He also attended workshops with Ruth Bernhard-is this the Bernhard =
referenced in the recent spate of e-mails?

  Well I'm off to Portugal in the next hour or so and will look forward =
to any replies when I get back unless I find a cyber cafe and work out =
how to access my e-mail from abroad.

It's exactly the Zone system teaching.  Plus expose, expand develop in a

  Subject: Modern Thin Film Emulsions


  In the Sept/Oct. 1999 View Camera magazine (available from Robert White)
there was a very interesting article by Mark Citric in respect of the
response of modern thin film emulsions to Zone system practice.

  He came to the conclusion that thin film emulsions do not behave in the
same way as the old 'thick' film emulsions of Adams day.
  He found that N- development retarded the development of all values, not
just the highlights. I have also noticed this phenomenen.

  He now uses the following technique for N- developments.

  Meter for zone 3 and place on Zone 5 or 6. Ignore where highlights fall.
  Develop in Rodinal at 1:149 repeat 1:149 for about 12 minutes-note:-this
technique may only work with Tmax100 and Rodinal combination.
  This gives a printable negative. Goes against all Zone system teachings.

  I have only had a chance so far to do one or two experiments but the
results look very encouraging.

  I expose Tmax.100 at 40ASA and develop for 9 minutes in a Combitank- 5 x 4
sheet film.

  Anybody else out there had experience of this technique?

  He also attended workshops with Ruth Bernhard-is this the Bernhard
referenced in the recent spate of e-mails?

  Well I'm off to Portugal in the next hour or so and will look forward to
any replies when I get back unless I find a cyber cafe and work out how to
access my e-mail from abroad.

To answer to Barry and Tim I would like to say that I agree with both of 
you. You need a good negative with details in hightlights and shadows but
after the technique gave you a printable negative the way how you see the
print is the result of the conscious and subconscious of the photographer
and the different possibilities you have to manipulate the print is what iis
opening the way to the creativity. Do not forget that the final print is
never the "reality" it is always the reflect of the photographer.

For the last 6 months, for reasons too arcane to go into now, I've been
happily using a Phillips PCS2000 enlarger with no real problems at all.
However, as my "darkroom" is in fact a shed at the bottom of the garden,
this weekend instead of just routinely cleaning off the usual dust etc that
happily accumulates, I removed the bottom and top glasses from the neg.
carrier and washed them off in lots of very hot water. Lo and behold, last
night for the first time, Newton's Rings everywhere. Having given up smoking
for the first time for 30 years this week, this I didn't need! I've made up
a temporary "fudge" by using some strips of black paper from the inner
lining of a box of Forte paper to space the neg. from the glass, but this is
nearly as much trouble as it's worth, and I'm sure it won't contribute very
much to keeping things flat. The glasses aren't a standard size, and have
bevelled top and bottom edges. Does anyone know where I could get
anti-Newton Ring glass made up in the UK, or does anyone have any other
ideas? Otherwise, it'll be back to doing a very poor impression of Marlboro'
man!!

Sorry about the off-topic subject, but since we seem to have quite an
informed group here I wanted to try to get some decent advice. No one really
responded constructively in the newsgroups.

Can anyone please offer some advice about rectangular filter systems? I am
looking at systems such as Lee, Hitech, etc.

The widest lenses I have are Pentax 67 45mm (82mm thread) and Canon EOS 20mm
(72mm thread). Will these 100mm (4") systems handle these lenses ok? I am
thinking of when using...
- single filter, say a grad
- two filters , say grad + warming or polariser
- three filters, maybe grad, warming and polariser (eek!)

HiTech seems to have holders with a ring for a big screw in polariser on the
front. Is this a good idea?

Is HiTech's hood as good as Lee?

There is, or used to be, a system called Cromatek, where the rectangular
filter holder had a kind if box around it, which was meant to stop light
from the side leaking into the optical system via the edge of the filters.
Is this actually a problem on systems which don't have such a box? What do
people do about it, if so?

All advice gratefully received.

Regards,  John Fryatt

By this I mean the blue shadows disappear completely. sorry about that.

With the blue sky darkening a bit with the 'red sensitivity', putting on a
dark yellow to a red filter makes for clear shadows and can really screw up
an image when one is expecting darker skies & darker but usable shadow
areas, only to find the shadow areas go black with no detail.

Due to the areas I love to shoot in I have an ongoing battle with lack of
shadow detail. I shoot in the heavy forest of the southern Appalachians
{USA} in an area that is considered a rainforest. The second problem is that
the forest floor is usually dark in tone { wet, deep chocolate brown, leaves
and rocky areas with again... dark rocks ! } These factors along with the
fact that I shoot in constant shadow drives my shadow areas very low on the
zonal scale.  Many times even at mid day the dark parts of rocks and
undergrowth will fall below the ability of my meter to read { Pentax
Spotmeter } . Nantahala - the Indian name for one of my favorite areas means
"land of the noonday sun" as noon is the only time sun falls directly on the
area.  Shooting 8x10 my exposures usually start at 4 t0 12 seconds
 metered}  and often need to go to several minutes ....without the
reciprocity factor thrown in!
 For years I've tried about every film and am wondering what the Bergger
film might do for me. I've not had the chance to shoot any but hopefully
will someday soon.
 I've never had the chance to shoot the old thick emulsion films such as
SuperXX as I was a product of the '60's and 70's in photography and the
older films of the 40' and 50's were just not part of my experience.
 Any thoughts as to what I might find with the Bergger film with long
exposures or any suggestions on my specific problem?

Hello !
Have you tried to check the position of the glass ? Some anti newton
glass are hard to distinguish from plain one. So you could have placed
them in reverse ?
BTW when I stop smoking about 20 years ago, I xas told to get some
Vitamin C tablets and to put them under my tongue to dissolve? They
proved effective, if not for me, for my familly to endure my company.. 
;)

The answer is dead easy. Tetenal make an anti Newton's rings spray. It works
well.

Have you considered carrying studio lighting with you? Sorry Chuck - I'm not
taking this seriously enough! It does remind me a little though of the
church interior architectural photographer who will walk round during the
multi-minute exposure letting off a small flash gun into particularly dark
corners.

Due to the areas I love to shoot in I have an ongoing battle with lack of
shadow detail. I shoot in the heavy forest of the southern Appalachians
{USA} in an area that is considered a rainforest. The second problem is that
the forest floor is usually dark in tone { wet, deep chocolate brown, leaves
and rocky areas with again... dark rocks ! } These factors along with the
fact that I shoot in constant shadow drives my shadow areas very low on the
zonal scale.  Many times even at mid day the dark parts of rocks and
undergrowth will fall below the ability of my meter to read { Pentax
Spotmeter } . Nantahala - the Indian name for one of my favorite areas means
"land of the noonday sun" as noon is the only time sun falls directly on the
area.  Shooting 8x10 my exposures usually start at 4 t0 12 seconds
 metered}  and often need to go to several minutes ....without the
reciprocity factor thrown in!
 For years I've tried about every film and am wondering what the Bergger
film might do for me. I've not had the chance to shoot any but hopefully
will someday soon.
 I've never had the chance to shoot the old thick emulsion films such as
SuperXX as I was a product of the '60's and 70's in photography and the
older films of the 40' and 50's were just not part of my experience.
 Any thoughts as to what I might find with the Bergger film with long
exposures or any suggestions on my specific problem?

I would suggest you contact Tim Whelan in Rockport, ME
(mailto:tim@midcoast.com) - at the very least to discuss what you have. His
shop is just down the street from MPW.  I know of no one more knowledgeable
about photo-books (including Rickson Reed...), nor more unfailing generous
and honest than Tim.  He'd tell you straight and might possibly be able to
help you move them.

Good luck -

I think I got them the right way round, but I'll reverse them tonight and
see what happens. 
Thanks for the idea of vitamin C, I'll give that a go too!!

Hello !
Have you tried to check the position of the glass ? Some anti newton
glass are hard to distinguish from plain one. So you could have placed
them in reverse ?
BTW when I stop smoking about 20 years ago, I xas told to get some
Vitamin C tablets and to put them under my tongue to dissolve? They
proved effective, if not for me, for my familly to endure my company.. 
;)

Why not put an edited list up for us to see, I'm sure many others like
myself would be interested. I know there has been concern in the past
regarding attachments, but perhaps this time an .rtf or word file might be
permissible

The answer is dead easy. Tetenal make an anti Newton's rings spray. It works
well.

Kodak's film is fairly expensive and is limited in size to 8x10. For both of
these reasons I've never tried it either. However, Liam Lawless has
developed a system for using lith film as, in effect, a duplicating film so
that enlarged negatives can be made in one step. I haven't used his method
myself but I've seen the results obtained by someone who has and they were
quite good. The method is spread out over the first four issues of the
publication "The World Journal of Post Factory Photography" published by
Judy Siegel. I believe she can be contacted at www.panix.com .

Bergger does have a good shadow range.  There are also developer 
additives that can help with the shadows.  Either Crone:C or Excell 
(both from the Formulary) additives are designed to open shadow 
detail without bothering the highlight values.  They also help with 
the internal contrast of those values thereby giving luminance to 
those areas.

hope this helps.

Daniel,
     I have both.  I never use the Hasselblad, first because of its weight,
second because you really need to tripod it a lot...i got a mamiya 7II and I
am in love with the camera, use it always, it is a great travel camera, it
is lightweight, the lenses are superb and the negs are directly
proportionate to the 8 x 10 format (besides, I don't like square...I am
rectangular in practice).It is also quieter than quiet in operation, no big
noise like the Hassie.
     My only problem with the Mamiya is that I would definitely buy the 80
mm lens and that is the one I use all the time, but this year I bought the
150, and I dropped the camera onto pavement and it definitely affected the
sharpness of the 150.  The 150 makes the camera more unwieldy, you have to
tripod it more, and now with the drop the camera and lens are not calibrated
correctly so I have to send both back to Mamiya and recalibrate, hence I am
out of a camera for a time being.  But the 150 has also very little leeway
in sharpness and has to be focussed very correctly or else you get a soft
neg, and either the drop did this or it is generally true--the area that the
camera says is being photographed isn't necessarily what you get on your
neg; it tends to cut off at the left and the top at closer range.  It also
has a much smaller focus area in the viewfinder.  So bottom line, buy the
Mamiya hands down, but just go with the wider lenses from 80 mm (mostly
'normal' but actually equiv to a 39) and wider.

Thanks to Alexis Neel for the additive info.
I'll try the Formulary as soon as my next order goes in.

And to Barry for his studio lighting idea I will only say..... how about 3
meter by 4 meter reflectors.... I  need only carry a half dozen or so!
 This is the joking side of things but two years ago I ran into a female
photographer miles in the woods using two 4x8 foot silver panels to
photograph some Dwarf Crested Iris that grow in profusion at certain
altitudes in spring. She had to hike in with the reflectors and then go back
for the camera and reverse the procedure for the return trip!  Dedication!

  I wonder if you have tried Plus-X or Tri-X for this. These films have a
very long toe. That is anouther way of saying the shadow contrast is low.
So, if given enough exposure the shadows appear "luminous". Double-X was a
very short toe film, i.e., it had high shadow contrast so I am not sure it
would have accomplished what you want. 
  The closest film to Double-X now is T-Max 100 processed in T-Max or Xtol.
It has a very short toe, a very long straight line portion and virtually no
shoulder. It also has a flatter spectral response than most other films,
one of the virtues of Double-X.
  There are several double coated films still being made. I don't know
about Ilford but Kodak films other than T-Max and Technical Pan are all
double coated. This is a method of controlling the H&D curve of the film.
Evidently, the technology of T-Max films allows a wider distribution of
sensitivities of silver particals in a single emulsion.
  Technical Pan has a very thin emulsion, one reason it takes a lot of care
to control.
  The thinner emulsions have less light scattering (irradiation) than
double coated emulsions so have generally better resolution and edge
contrast. Older types of thin emulsions, like the old Adox films, tend to
shoulder off quickly so tended toward blown out highlights whcih could not
be brought back by burning in.
  Double-X was a very old emulsion when it was discontinued. I suspect that
if it was brought back many would find it too grainy and mushy. I wonder if
Kodak even remembers how to make it anymore.  
  BTW, there was also a Super-XX film. This was 16mm reversal film although
I think at one time 35mm motion picture negative was also sold under this
name. 
  I don't know what Chrone C is but I suspect it will not help with
improved shadow detail. What you need is the right shape H&D curve not
greater overall speed or fog suppression. 
  You might also have success by somewhat overexposing negatives to get
good shadow exposure and controlling overall contrast with a mask.
Photographic masks can be generated to controll the curve shape as well as
overall contrast. That is, they can stretch either shadow or highlight
areas or even both, leaving a straight line center. 
  Someone has a good web site illustrating this type of mask, I'll look
through my bookmarks and try to find it. Its possible the site belongs to
someone on this list. This is different than the familiar un-sharp masking.

Crone:C is a film additive that used at normal strength (1 oz. per 
quart of D-76 ONLY) opens shadow detail without blocking the 
highlights.  It also gives a stop  of film speed, although we prefer 
to use less dev. time.  It is exactly this type of situation that 
this was made for.  It produces an internal contrast of the values 
and adds a "sparkle" to otherwise (what can be) dull shadow areas. 
Formulary (being the distributor) will be more than happy to provide 
you some literature on the product.  They also sell a similar version 
called Excel that works in all chemistry and we use it in Hutchings 
Pyro to bring back the film speed and open the shadows, which one 
tends to lose with pyro.

Richard'
Thanks for the film curve info!
 I am now using a masking technique and have been at it for about twenty
years. Works pretty good but is a real pain!  Even though it has been part
of my  normal procedure for years I hate it! Almost rather carry the
reflectors! :o) It works fine for controlling things but to me destroys some
of the spontaneity... It takes me three days to do masking....I can do
several at a time but there is something to be said for looking at a neg and
starting to work on it without the mask drying time....and it ALWAYS takes
me two or more masks to get it right . I agree that the film curve is the
answer.
 I was hoping that maybe using the Bergger film and a D23 waterbath might
give full shadow contrast while surpressing the highlights.  I have tried
several techniques on the more modern films with little success so thought
that I might try the older emulsion types.  I may be having a reciprocity
type problem with the shadow parts of the negs as there is often little
change in the shadow density with 3 or even 5 stop increase in exposure
while the midtone and higher areas really build density quickly.

Dear Les,

It's a two bath developer 'tuned' to give highest film speed (and shadow
separation) with fine grain. Compared with DiXactol, to which it is related,
it is not as sharp, but DiXactol isn't as fine grain a DiLuxol.
Incidentally, there is a single bath version called Luxol too. I am not
marketing either of these yet because I don't yet have the necessary
facilities to meet demand reliably. Can't let people down by direct mail.
I may well do so in due course.

I stand by my view. I make my living printing professionally and the vast
majority of clients' negatives are underexposed and overdeveloped. Sure, I
use all the usual printing techniques to get a result, but there aren't any
of these pictures that would not be improved by better negative exposure and
development. The same amount of time and effort spent printing the better
negative would provide a significantly better final image. That's what I
said in my message to the list. That's what I stand by. You can't make a
fine print from a coarse negative.
Incidentally, I didn't say that pre/post paper flashing (no difference
between the effect of those anyway) are purely recovery processes. You put
those words in my mouth. I did say that those techniques and others are
often necessary to recover the image from poor negatives.
The simple message I gave was, for the negative, expose enough and develop
the least. It doesn't need close adherence to the Zone System to get fine
results if this simple credo is followed.
It sounds to me that if you are exposing shadows on Zone VI you are
following the first part of this, and then some! Would you expound further
Les on your approach of developing the negative thus exposed to a very high
contrast to print 'without any loss of quality'. I presume you did closely
controlled comparative tests to arrive at this view.

To suggest that techniques such as pre and post flashing paper etc are
solely recovery processes for ill developed negatives beggars belief.
Surely, all controls, no matter how good or bad the negative can only be an
aid to the production of the expressive print. Yes, these and other methods
are used in the salvage operation of printing a poor negative but when used
in conjunction with a well exposed and developed negative the subtleties
possible in the final print will further improve it. I find that there is no
extra effort involved in using any dodge or technique required in making the
fine print, whether that effort is in developing the negative or making the
print. For me it is all in a days work. Printers, are in my view, simply
problem solvers. It is our job to highlight the problem and to find the
solution and if that means using the techniques apparently frowned upon by
Barry then so be it.

 As a matter of interest I always place my shadows on Zone VI and develop
most of my films normally, based on my own tests. The final negative is of
high contrast and I can print it without any loss of quality. The Zone VI
placement of shadows was the result of a very stimulating few days spent
with Bruce Barnbaum a few years ago, when many of the matters that he will
be writing about in forthcoming issues of Photo Techniques were discussed in
interesting and sometimes heated debate. Perhaps the amount of red wine
consumed had a lot to do with the heat of the debate.

Tim Rudman replied:

Whilst I agree with you that a 'good' negative is unquestionably a better
starting point than is a bad one - and who could disagree with that - I
don't agree with your view that the above and many other techniques are only
'a recovery process'.
This is fine if what you want is a black and white print which shows the
scene as taken or possibly as visualised. There is nothing wrong with that,
but it isn't the whole story of course. Nobody can say that this is the
right or wrong way for a print to look (I'm not suggesting that you did
Barry). Photography is a recording process and can be used as a tool in any
way the artist - and I choose the word carefully - wants it to. Photography
is too broad to be confined by any persons view, or collections of persons
for that matter.
I use all the techniques you mention and a great many more besides. Mostly I
don't use them as rescue techniques. When I do it is because of either short
comings in the neg - which is my fault -or lighting (or lack of!) problems.
Mostly however I use them for artistic expression to get something that even
the perfect negative won't give me - because it goes beyond that. Indeed I
often see a picture in a scene that is not much like the scene at all, and
that is where a bit of darkroom magic is not only helpful but essential.
That is quite valid. The vast range of aclaimed photographic art bears
testament to that. It would be awful if we all produced the same without the
beauty of individual creativity.
Using these techniques is no different than using bromoil or many other
alternative creative processes, or bleaching, toning, hand colouring or
whatever it takes to express that creative need that drives us. Look at some
of the lovely work done using liquid emulsion mixed with sand and other
material to give it texture prior to toning and colouring. Not your way of
working or mine - but I'm glad people are doing it and 'photography' is the
richer for that (IMHO)
Tim  ;-)

My reply:

Tim,
The first thing I want to do is apologise. It is only when I got your reply
that I realised that my reference to "the master printer" may have made it
seem that I was aiming at your book with that phrase in the title. I most
definitely wasn't, either directly or indirectly. So sorry if it seemed I
attributed an unjustified approach to you. In fact I had somebody else
entirely in mind.
It is all the more unfortunate since we are not disagreeing. My slack use of
English meant that I must have given the impression that I was supporting
the Zone purists. I wasn't. My point was simply that film will record up to
15 or more zones. The problem is printing them.
Faced with a wide subject brightness range most in-built camera meters, no
matter what the wild claims made by advertisements, greatly underexpose.
They effectively try to average the shot, no matter what matrix metering is
claimed to achieve. Thus there are unpleasantly empty shadows in the print.
But it is not just a matter of camera meters. MOST of the work that I see at
workshops and in one-to-one coaching is underexposed EVEN BY PHOTOGRAPHERS
USING THE ZONE SYSTEM. This is caused by over-optimistic placing of shadow
areas on too low a zone.
No, the simple point I was making  was that a negative should have enough
exposure to place full shadow detail on zone III. The highlights can fall
where they will even up to zone XV or more. Normal development renders them
virtually unprintable however. Pulled development plus compensating or
tanning development will lead to rich satisfying prints however. For pretty
well all landscape work, I find an approximate N-1 development to be called
for because of the difference between the land and sky areas' brightness. It
is far easier and gives a better quality print to step up contrast in the
land areas, and to print skies or other highlights at something like a
'normal' grade than it is to print land areas at normal and be forced into
printing highlights at soft.
My basic philosophy is to expose enough and develop the least. Obviously,
there will be odd occasions where the subject brightness ratio is so low
that generous exposure and minimum development would yield too flat a
negative, but these occasions are actually pretty rare. The problem is that
our eyes and brain 'adjust' the brightness range of a scene as we scan it by
opening/closing the eye's iris, and in the brain's further processing the
information so received. We are often fooled into thinking that a scene is
flatter than it really is, and film will see it much more contrastily. For
genuinely flat scenes, I find 'normal' exposure and development entirely
adequate.
So I am not saying interpret scenes tone for tone, zone for zone, for
literal representation. That's neither possible nor desirable. My comments
do have great relevance to roll or 35mm film use where it usually isn't
possible to exert tight zone control. With the expose enough develop the
least doctrine, I believe such controls are unnecessary.
None of my comments have any bearing on whether one composes pictures in
camera or in the mind for later 'working up' in the darkroom. I actually
don't see any difference. If you visualise your final image at original
exposure, it makes no difference whether your visualisation is of a
'straight' full-toned print or one produced by various manipulative methods.
What I do believe to be true is that no amount of such manipulation will
create a strong picture if the original 'straight' image is weak.
You and I have our differences I know on our approach to the final image -
no problem with that, it's a productive difference - but my original message
had nothing to do with that. Honest!
I really was thinking about demonstrations I have frequently seen given
about getting a print from a hopelessly exposed and developed negative.
These are definitely recovery jobs, and are essentially treating symptoms.
The thousands of such negatives given normal development after exposure via
a camera meters arriving at my workshop to print over the years are a
testimony to that.
As an aside, a well proven method of debating is to attribute arguments to
the other debater that they never made, then proceed to shoot them down. It
is a method all too frequently used to attack zone purists. The claim is
that they want a literal sterile representation. It's not true of course. I
suppose there must be a few people out there who work this way. I'm not one
of them. Nor are the vast majority of Zone system workers. The sole purpose
of the zone system is to allow us to achieve the image we visualise
predictably, literal or otherwise.
Sorry once again Tim for the unintended slight.

Chuck
I envy you guys in the USA the wonderful landscape you inhabit, and its
sheer variety. Sure we have truly beautiful country here, but nothing is as
extreme as in the US - the mountains are not as high, there are no deserts
and dunes, no giant Redwoods, no huge distances and great plains.
So when you are talking of the inky darkness on the forest floor, it is
actually difficult for me to visualise it. It is true then when running
landscape photography workshops here, it is a constant problem that
photographers will photograph forest or woodland views showing the base of
trees, but also include glimpses of the sky through branches. With the
exposure necessary for the ground, the sky is very very overexposed, and the
development necessary for shadow separation makes these sky glimpse
highlights bullet-proof. There is no way that these tiny highlights, often
dozens in number, can be burned in without the leaves and branches around
them acquiring a dark halo. Leaving them alone results in ghastly chalky
bare paper patches among the treetops which automatically attract the eye.
I often persuade photographers to avoid the problem by photographing
woodland located on rising ground before them, so that the sky is excluded.
But that really is avoiding the issue.
In view of the current correspondence on this list about printing greatly
overexposed and developed highlights, it would be interesting to hear of
others' techniques for handling this problem when printing.
Another thought. I wonder if the vastness and extreme types of landscape in
the USA affects the whole approach to photography. For instance, here in the
UK there are a few people working with large format, but my impression is
that it is nothing like the number of people in the States who work in large
and sometimes huge formats.

Thanks to Alexis Neel for the additive info.
I'll try the Formulary as soon as my next order goes in.

And to Barry for his studio lighting idea I will only say..... how about 3
meter by 4 meter reflectors.... I  need only carry a half dozen or so!
 This is the joking side of things but two years ago I ran into a female
photographer miles in the woods using two 4x8 foot silver panels to
photograph some Dwarf Crested Iris that grow in profusion at certain
altitudes in spring. She had to hike in with the reflectors and then go back
for the camera and reverse the procedure for the return trip!  Dedication!

This has been my constant problem for years. I try to photograph in the pre
sunrise glow that comes to the sky just before sunrise. This takes hiking in
on the day before and working out the composition with a compass { for
sunrise dirrection} or a sometimes very hard scramble in the dark with 8x10.
This is absolutely necessary for color transparency shooting but I'm always
trying to figure a way out of it for B&W.
 Overcast days help a lot but all of this "flat" light shooting takes a toll
on the image in the reduction of sometimes much needed dirrectional light.
It also takes a toll on my legs as night hiking with 40 t0 80 lbs. is a real
pain!!
  I'm real happy to get to photograph the wild areas of the US but sure wish
I could get to photograph in the Scotish Highlands and on the
Moors.....after Kodiak bears your Baskerville Hounds aren't too scarry any
more but the phosperesent glow at night might just be a bit un-nerving.
Some of that Irish Green might look great in color also!
Could you send a little fog and mist....., awful dry and dusty here this
year.?

Good Morning everybody.
I'm surprised there were not more responses to the debate between
Barry,
Tim and Les (Re: Barnbaum & Picker).
I like to hear as many ideas and opinions as possible on any subject
that coincides with my practice, (surely the whole point of this
site), but always like to ignore other peoples blinkered ideologies
and dogma. Clearly the accumulation of others experience should be
helpful to
one and all.
It is great to share knowledge, but lets refrain from preaching at
people.Much more important than anyone's ideology or dogma , is the
photographers personal progress. (Assuming that photography is not
just a way of passing time).

For one that may mean a sense of technical accomplishment,
for another something quite different.
I am only interested in creating images that communicate "my feelings"
to a given subject. I strive to improve technique and my control of
the "craft" so that I am better able to do this. The technique in
itself is meaningless, and not worth an argument.

It is helpful therefore to use language in a way that promotes ideas.
This may involve taking the "self" out of technical talk.
The self should be poured shamelessly into the images 100%.
We are all trying to communicate with images. It is the Final image
that matters... and not much else, not the developer, or the
development, the enlarger, the stop bath or the make of museum board.
just the Final image.

Barry is right a better negative is always better.
Tim is right, the various techniques mentioned can all be used to
further expressive ends in the making of a print.
And Les says something I relate to only to well, to the effect that
printers are simply problem solvers, (it feels like this too often in
my opinion).
Clearly it makes sense to understand the craft, otherwise who is in
control? but far richer, the "broad church" of techniques and styles,
and the open debate, than the broadcasting of ones own narrow outlook
in the form of ideology and dogma.

Here's to richness, diversity, and the privilage of creativity.

I've given pre-exposure a try several times but probably not enough to
really get the full use out of it. I used it to elevate the shadows in full
daylight .
 I have an Ansel Adams movie that shows him using it in an "outdoor"
classroom situation. I guess that I will play around with it again as it
does seem to achieve close to what I need. If my thoughts that the shadow
detail in many of my images is just too dark for even two or three stops to
help {as far as giving extra exposure goes }then maybe having the shadow
area almost at the threshold level to start with might just be an answer.
 Good idea!

I don't understand how you get a high contrast negative by placing the
shadows on Zone VI and then developing normally. If you place your shadows
on Zone VI it would  seem to be impossible to produce any dark tones in the
print unless you underdevelop. In my own experience I've found that the
standard zone system advice to place the darkest tones in which you want
detail on Zone III leads to underexposed negatives. In a "normal" scene I've
found that I get better negatives by placing these portions of the scene on
at least Zone III 1/2 and usually IV but never VI unless I'm deliberately
seeking a high key print.

 Could you elaborate a little? I perhaps should add that I've attended one
of Bruce's workshops and read his book "The Art of Photography" so I'm
generally familiar with his theories and approaches, particularly his
"expanded zone system" approach. It's just that I don't recall a suggestion
to place shadows on Zone VI and then develop normally to achieve a high
contrast print (and am too lazy to re-read my workshop notes or the book).
Thanks. Brian

Surely, all controls, no matter how good or bad the negative can only be an
aid to the production of the expressive print. Yes, these and other methods
are used in the salvage operation of printing a poor negative but when used
in conjunction with a well exposed and developed negative the subtleties
possible in the final print will further improve it. I find that there is no
extra effort involved in using any dodge or technique required in making the
fine print, whether that effort is in developing the negative or making the
print. For me it is all in a days work. Printers, are in my view, simply
problem solvers. It is our job to highlight the problem and to find the
solution and if that means using the techniques apparently frowned upon by
Barry then so be it.
>
>  As a matter of interest I always place my shadows on Zone VI and develop
most of my films normally, based on my own tests. The final negative is of
high contrast and I can print it without any loss of quality. The Zone VI
placement of shadows was the result of a very stimulating few days spent
with Bruce Barnbaum a few years ago, when many of the matters that he will
be writing about in forthcoming issues of Photo Techniques were discussed in
interesting and sometimes heated debate. Perhaps the amount of red wine
consumed had a lot to do with the heat of the debate.

I have been told by several folks that there is a glass called Den or Din
that is sold here in the USA that is very inexpensive { $8.00 US per 10 x10
inch size}  ...have not used it personally but am going to replace my
contact printer glass and 10 inch enlarger glass with it as soon as I get
the chance. It seems to work well for Clyde Butcher
 http://www.clydebutcher.com/ } who makes the largest prints that I know of
here in the states. Clyde never seems to have Newton problems and in ten
foot prints you would see it if it was there! The Den {sp?} glass is coated
glass for gallery use against UV damage. The coating seems to prevent the
rings. I would imagine that it is available for those on the "far side of
the pond" by asking at matting and framing shops.
 BTW Clyde is a real character and a visit to his gallery in the Everglades
Park in Southern Florida is a treat for those that love big prints. Anything
smaller than about 40 inches is a miniature to Clyde! Last time I saw him he
was talking about doing his own paper coating so as to do some really big
stuff.....ten footers just don't seem to satisfy him any more!  :o)

Chuck wrote about negative pre-exposure:

I've given pre-exposure a try several times but probably not enough to
really get the full use out of it. I used it to elevate the shadows in full
daylight .
 I have an Ansel Adams movie that shows him using it in an "outdoor"
classroom situation. I guess that I will play around with it again as it
does seem to achieve close to what I need. If my thoughts that the shadow
detail in many of my images is just too dark for even two or three stops to
help {as far as giving extra exposure goes }then maybe having the shadow
area almost at the threshold level to start with might just be an answer.
 Good idea!

Chuck
I am kicking myself for not thinking to mention this technique to you.
Thanks to "Another Chuck" for reminding me. Negative preflashing really does
work very well. I have found that you can preflash a negative up to a Zone
II level without the effect becoming unpleasantly obvious. I have a series
of pictures taken on the edge of the Forest of Dean here with trees receding
into darkness. I took a meter reading of a grey card fastened to the nearest
tree trunk and used that as the basic exposure for a number of negatives on
Delta 400 processed in different ways. Some of the negatives also had a
preflash at Zone II. I printed the negatives reproducing each one with the
grey card showing its correct 18% as nearly as I could. The effect of the
preflash is almost magical in revealing far more trees retreating into the
gloom. The overall contrast is dropped too, so that the separation of the
mid tones of the tree trunks in the light is lowered, but this is easily
rectified by printing these in at a slightly higher paper grade.
many people seem to go to a lot of unnecessary trouble devising rigs to
pre-expose film in their darkroom, which they then have to carry with them
separately from normal film. It really is much simpler than that. Just
before exposing film in the camera, give it the required pre-flash. I use a
filter holder with opal glass, but you can use a couple of layers of white
plastic shopping bag as a diffuser.
What I do is this. Having composed my picture and loaded the film into the
camera, I take a meter reading with my spot meter through the diffusing
filter/plastic along the same axis as the camera lens. The meter indicates a
reading for Zone V, so I stop down three stops on the camera from the
indicated reading to reach Zone II. I swap the diffuser to the camera lens
and expose the film at Zone II through the diffuser. I then remove the
diffuser and expose the picture on to this same frame of film using my
normal metering technique. That is I read the shadow area in which I want
full shadow detail and place it Zone III.
Film speed goes up by about 50%, but I usually just ignore this since I am
aiming for greater shadow detail.
You do not need to pre-flash to this level of course to get raised shadow
detail. You could pre-flash at Zones I, 0, or even less, but it sounds as
though you could really use the maximum effect. I have tried pre-flash at
Zone III, but an over all fog becomes apparent I find.
It would be simple to test the effect of the technique by taking identical
negatives, other than various degrees of pre-flashing, along with a control
non pre-flashed negative, then processing them identically.
This is well worth trying. You could also combine it pre-flashed harder
grade paper when printing. This would give lower highlight contrast while
maintaining shadow separation.

Barry T..

Thanks to both you and the other Chuck!
This sure might be better than masking or waterbath results for the majority
of my work....
 I actually had some students using this technique years ago! I just used it
to help with shadows in otherwise contrasty situations! Never really thought
about using it to help for general photography.

 A couple of questions..... Do you have to pre flash? can you post flash
with as good of results as in paper-flashing?
 My question here is directed to possible post flashing at a later time when
the light is not "popping" so that I could shoot fast when needed and mark
the holders for later and possible much more accurate flashing back at the
darkroom. I already mark different holders for + and - development and this
would work in quite well!
 The second reason for post flashing is that I use ultra wide lenses often
{90 XL or 120 SW on 8x10 inch film and am afraid of cutting off some of the
image as almost no filter holders will work in this situation without
cutting off at least tiny corners. I could use lenses of better and more
even coverage to do the flashing instead of chancing it in the hurried times
when shooting.
Another problem I might have is often there might be no area that would
record as a single tone even with the opal glass as diffuser. I rarely have
any sky when I need to flash and I'm not sure that contrasty wooded scenes
would always work with the diffuser to permit even tones.
 A second question would be about film choice with flashing........Without
over taxing my mind { its already weakened thinking of the possibilities of
flashing on some of my images...:o) } is there a logical film class or type
that might work better or that should be avoided?
 Any idea where in the USA I might get a Wallace disc ......I'll probably
make one as Barry mentions but am curious about the price and possibly
better construction if this works as well as I'm thinking?
 Thanks for the help!
Visions of wonderful shadow detail dancing in my head,
Chuck { just to keep your Chucks straight ....I'm the good looking bald one
with the beard and southern accent! }

John,

I have and use both the Lee & Hi-Tek systems. In use I prefer the Lee holder
as the slots can be tailored for different thickness filters and their self
supporting bellows is very good. I have a number of Lee holders each with a
different slot configuration. For instance with the widest angle I use (18mm
Distagon for my Contax RTS III's) I have a holder with just one slot which
is the
maximum usable without vignetting).

I regularly use 100mm sq. glass filters by Tiffen, Harrison & Harrison etc.
together with Hi-Tec resin filters. The circular adapter ring on the Hi-Tec
holder accepts a 105mm Polariser made by Helioplan. Whilst it is an
excellent filter it is very heavy and t h i c k! which can be a problem
using wide angle lenses. B+W make a superb polariser called a True-Pol in
100mm sq. which I use a lot.

For B&W contrast filters, colour temperature filters, grads etc my choice is
Hi-Tec. As I understand it the main difference between Lee and Hi-Tec is
that Lee filters are surface coated and Hi-Tec dyed in the mass. It is said
that surface coating can be problematical in optical flatness which if using
more than one filter could have an accumulative effect. Apparently a slight
curve on a resin filter will have little if any effect optically, whilst a
surface which is not flat in terms of inconsistent thickness will have a
detrimental effect.

Hi-Tec are based not far from me in 'Welsh' Wales and apparently make for
Chromatek, Sinar and Hasselblad (resins) amongst others.

The widest angle I use on medium format is the 40mm Distagon for the
Hasselblad and 100mm sq. filters can be used but there are limits on
rotation before vignetting occurs. Also with the wider angle lenses some
experimentation is necessary to find the maximum number of slots that can be
used before vignetting occurs. I also use the holder on the 350mm TCC f4
Tele-Tessar for the 'blad and that has a very large front element - works
great with it!

BTW - always put the polariser furthest from the lens or you might get light
interference patterns (similar to the patterns you might have seen on car
windscreens when wearing polarising sunglasses).

Does anyone have the formula for a chrome alum stop bath. I use to have it in one of my personal formula files, but can't seem to find it. It was
concocted with Potassium chrome alum and sodium Bisulfite.

  I can't find a stop bath with both Chrome Alum and Sodium bisulfite,
however, I do find:

Chrome Alum Hardening Stop Bath

Water				1.0 liter
Chrome Alum		     30.0 grams

And a tropical stop bath, which is the above plus 60 grams/liter of Sodium
Sulfate.

There is also Kodak SB-6
Water					1.0 liter
Sodium bisulfite or 
Potassium metabisulfite      30.0 grams

  Chrome alum is a more effective hardener than Alum but has less capacity
and tends to leave green stains.

To suggest that techniques such as pre and post flashing paper etc are solely recovery processes for ill developed negatives beggars belief. Surely, all controls, no matter how good or bad the negative can only be an aid to the production of the expressive print. Yes, these and other methods are used in the salvage operation of printing a poor negative but when used in conjunction with a well exposed and developed negative the subtleties possible in the final print will further improve it. I find that there is no extra effort involved in using any dodge or technique required in making the fine print, whether that effort is in developing the negative or making the print. For me it is all in a days work. Printers, are in my view, simply problem solvers. It is our job to highlight the problem and to find the solution and if that means using the techniques apparently frowned upon by Barry then so be it.

 As a matter of interest I always place my shadows on Zone VI and develop most of my films normally, based on my own tests. The final negative is of high contrast and I can print it without any loss of quality. The Zone VI placement of shadows was the result of a very stimulating few days spent with Bruce Barnbaum a few years ago, when many of the matters that he will be writing about in forthcoming issues of Photo Techniques were discussed in interesting and sometimes heated debate. Perhaps the amount of red wine consumed had a lot to do with the heat of the debate.

Tim Rudman replied:

Whilst I agree with you that a 'good' negative is unquestionably a better
starting point than is a bad one - and who could disagree with that - I
don't agree with your view that the above and many other techniques are only
'a recovery process'.
This is fine if what you want is a black and white print which shows the
scene as taken or possibly as visualised. There is nothing wrong with that,
but it isn't the whole story of course. Nobody can say that this is the
right or wrong way for a print to look (I'm not suggesting that you did
Barry). Photography is a recording process and can be used as a tool in any
way the artist - and I choose the word carefully - wants it to. Photography
is too broad to be confined by any persons view, or collections of persons
for that matter.
I use all the techniques you mention and a great many more besides. Mostly I
don't use them as rescue techniques. When I do it is because of either short
comings in the neg - which is my fault -or lighting (or lack of!) problems.
Mostly however I use them for artistic expression to get something that even
the perfect negative won't give me - because it goes beyond that. Indeed I
often see a picture in a scene that is not much like the scene at all, and
that is where a bit of darkroom magic is not only helpful but essential.
That is quite valid. The vast range of aclaimed photographic art bears
testament to that. It would be awful if we all produced the same without the
beauty of individual creativity.
Using these techniques is no different than using bromoil or many other
alternative creative processes, or bleaching, toning, hand colouring or
whatever it takes to express that creative need that drives us. Look at some
of the lovely work done using liquid emulsion mixed with sand and other
material to give it texture prior to toning and colouring. Not your way of
working or mine - but I'm glad people are doing it and 'photography' is the
richer for that (IMHO)
Tim  ;-)

My reply:

Tim,
The first thing I want to do is apologise. It is only when I got your reply
that I realised that my reference to "the master printer" may have made it
seem that I was aiming at your book with that phrase in the title. I most
definitely wasn't, either directly or indirectly. So sorry if it seemed I
attributed an unjustified approach to you. In fact I had somebody else
entirely in mind.
It is all the more unfortunate since we are not disagreeing. My slack use of
English meant that I must have given the impression that I was supporting
the Zone purists. I wasn't. My point was simply that film will record up to
15 or more zones. The problem is printing them.
Faced with a wide subject brightness range most in-built camera meters, no
matter what the wild claims made by advertisements, greatly underexpose.
They effectively try to average the shot, no matter what matrix metering is
claimed to achieve. Thus there are unpleasantly empty shadows in the print.
But it is not just a matter of camera meters. MOST of the work that I see at
workshops and in one-to-one coaching is underexposed EVEN BY PHOTOGRAPHERS
USING THE ZONE SYSTEM. This is caused by over-optimistic placing of shadow
areas on too low a zone.
No, the simple point I was making  was that a negative should have enough
exposure to place full shadow detail on zone III. The highlights can fall
where they will even up to zone XV or more. Normal development renders them
virtually unprintable however. Pulled development plus compensating or
tanning development will lead to rich satisfying prints however. For pretty
well all landscape work, I find an approximate N-1 development to be called
for because of the difference between the land and sky areas' brightness. It
is far easier and gives a better quality print to step up contrast in the
land areas, and to print skies or other highlights at something like a
'normal' grade than it is to print land areas at normal and be forced into
printing highlights at soft.
My basic philosophy is to expose enough and develop the least. Obviously,
there will be odd occasions where the subject brightness ratio is so low
that generous exposure and minimum development would yield too flat a
negative, but these occasions are actually pretty rare. The problem is that
our eyes and brain 'adjust' the brightness range of a scene as we scan it by
opening/closing the eye's iris, and in the brain's further processing the
information so received. We are often fooled into thinking that a scene is
flatter than it really is, and film will see it much more contrastily. For
genuinely flat scenes, I find 'normal' exposure and development entirely
adequate.
So I am not saying interpret scenes tone for tone, zone for zone, for
literal representation. That's neither possible nor desirable. My comments
do have great relevance to roll or 35mm film use where it usually isn't
possible to exert tight zone control. With the expose enough develop the
least doctrine, I believe such controls are unnecessary.
None of my comments have any bearing on whether one composes pictures in
camera or in the mind for later 'working up' in the darkroom. I actually
don't see any difference. If you visualise your final image at original
exposure, it makes no difference whether your visualisation is of a
'straight' full-toned print or one produced by various manipulative methods.
What I do believe to be true is that no amount of such manipulation will
create a strong picture if the original 'straight' image is weak.
You and I have our differences I know on our approach to the final image -
no problem with that, it's a productive difference - but my original message
had nothing to do with that. Honest!
I really was thinking about demonstrations I have frequently seen given
about getting a print from a hopelessly exposed and developed negative.
These are definitely recovery jobs, and are essentially treating symptoms.
The thousands of such negatives given normal development after exposure via
a camera meters arriving at my workshop to print over the years are a
testimony to that.
As an aside, a well proven method of debating is to attribute arguments to
the other debater that they never made, then proceed to shoot them down. It
is a method all too frequently used to attack zone purists. The claim is
that they want a literal sterile representation. It's not true of course. I
suppose there must be a few people out there who work this way. I'm not one
of them. Nor are the vast majority of Zone system workers. The sole purpose
of the zone system is to allow us to achieve the image we visualise
predictably, literal or otherwise.
Sorry once again Tim for the unintended slight.

therefore what I call my normal development is probably equivalent to about
minus 1 stop. I did carry out tests to determine personal development. My
thinking is to give a full exposure to shadows which will record all detail,
including those small dark areas that cannot be metered, even with a spot
meter. For example, imagine the dark edge surrounding a black painted closed
door at the end of a dimly lit corridor. I aim to make that dark edge pure
black in my final print and show the separation between that and the dimly
lit black door. In this imaginary exposure I would meter the darkest part of
the black door and place it on to Zone IV.  The slight reduction in
development has a minimal effect on the shadow areas.
>
> Using the 0 and 5 split grade printing  method together with accurate
fstop timing to 1/10th seconds I can obtain maximum separation in the
shadows sometimes by holding back on soft filtration to allow the grade 5 to
give me that separation. I am simply following the old adage of exposing for
the shadows and developing for the highlights although I do not wish reduce
the density of the negative highlights as much as most photographers. In
this way I produce the high contrast negative with maximum information
throughout. It suits my way of working and evidently it also suits the many
college students and private clients that I have taught over the past 15
years. The great thing about this wonderful obsessive attachment to
photography that we all have is that there are so many different ways to
achieve the result that we are after and not one of them is wrong. It's just
a matter of personal taste.

Mr Cheng,

I have used a Zone VI VC enlarger for nearly 6 years and I am very happy with it. The settings you are using as standard equate to grade 2. As far as I can understand, you are having to develop your film in DiXactol for a much longer time than recommended by Barry in order to achieve a negative contrast suitable to print on the Zone VI set at grade 2. I have little experience of DiXactol so I cannot advise on its use but it would seem that you have a problem somewhere. Certainly, my Zone VI Enlarger gives me all the contrast that I require even from negatives with little contrast. Should you wish to talk to me further and in more detail about the Zone VI enlarger please email me direct on lesmcl@scotborders.co.uk. I would be happy to help in any way that I can.

Thank you very much for your reply. I, at least know that I am doing things
right(1+7+300 mixing ratio  ;-)

And, I certainly will request to buy double pack of Solution B as I intend
to use single bath option. (the reason I switch to DiXactol is that, as I
understand, produces rather Brown stains than yellow/green by PMK, which I
think is nice for using with VC papers)

I am still in the process testing N, N+, N- with DiXactol, hereby, some
questions, if you don't mind

--What I do--:
Films: Artisa 8x10-400 (believed to be Ilford HP5)
Film exposed with Kodak Step tablet
single sheet/tray development, continue agitation at 21"c/70"F
(4+28+1200 ml DiXactol solution)

Oriental VC-FB paper with Zone VI enlarger(the one that has
dual lamps, one green, one Blue)

I 'standardize' my normal contrast by setting both green/blue lamps
at Max. output on the Zone VI enlarger

So far, I have develop films up to 14.5 minutes and it appears to be
N-1 1/2, I am going to try 18 minutes(15 min. x 1.2) and 20 minutes....

My question is, as you know, how far can DiXactol goes? the instruction
says most likely we only need to develop film under 10 minutes.

(I understand the rather long developing time is due to Zone VI enlarger's
lamps, I have the same 'problem' when I used PMK)

Any input from Anyone is welcomed.



Mr Cheng
Sorry I can't be too helpful about the ZoneVI head. I haven't used it. I am
sure other list members will have, and I am pretty sure that Les McLean here
in the UK has too. Maybe they could advise. I must say that I had not heard
of this kind of contrast drop with the head, and I am pretty suspicious
about it. It is much more likely that underdevelopment is taking place. By
10 minutes you should be getting pretty contrasty negatives with HP5 Plus in
DiXactol.
If your dilutions are correct, and the temperature is accurate, I would be
questioning the freshness of the developer. Is the part A concentrate a pale
straw colour, or is it a stronger tint?

Tetenal sells Anti-Newton-spray which you can spray on a normal (faultless)
glass plate. Seems to me to be the cheapest solution.

Well my old (1991) information is:

Wallace Expo/Discs
13715 Wallace Place
Morgan Hill, CA 95037
Info: 408-778-2040
Order: 800-446-5086

Sizes from 49-72mm at $21.75 to $25.75.

I tried a web search but my (AOL) try came up empty.  You could try the phone 
numbers.  Think I'll dig mine up and play with it.  Always nice to have 
another tool to use.

Dan,

The best way to get Spam is to reply to spam. That way the
spammer get an affirmation that your adress actually exists
and is being used. Afterwards you never get rid of them
anymore.

So, the best way to respond is not to respond at all.

Ron,

Thanks for that. It's very helpful.

Have you had any problem with non-image forming light getting into the
'system' from the side?
That's what the Cromatek shroud thingy is meant to prevent, but is it
necessary?

Thanks,   John

I found no trouble with Bergger getting shadow detail, using FX 2 and very
long development times (26- 29minutes).

I found more consistent results with Forte, using Edwal FG 7 and a dram of
Amidol 2% (dram = 2 ozs) per liter.

I'm going through the same contemplation with a Hugo Meyer Plasmat of 88mm
dia.

I'm thinking an 85B is a must and a .10 ND with a .20 ND; then a #8 yellow
and a #15 yellow for B&W, long expsoures; then there's the 81A and that
Amber filter whose number is written down somewhere but I always forget.
It's for good fog, to include the fog in the pic.

That's seven filters and the best way seems to buy gelatin sheets and cut
the stuff, glue it onto shaped cardboard and make my own slip over filters.
Like shutter-lenscovers.  (Or, is that lenscover-shutters?)

 A couple of questions..... Do you have to pre flash? can you post flash
with as good of results as in paper-flashing?
 My question here is directed to possible post flashing at a later time when
the light is not "popping" so that I could shoot fast when needed and mark
the holders for later and possible much more accurate flashing back at the
darkroom. I already mark different holders for + and - development and this
would work in quite well!
 The second reason for post flashing is that I use ultra wide lenses often
{90 XL or 120 SW on 8x10 inch film and am afraid of cutting off some of the
image as almost no filter holders will work in this situation without
cutting off at least tiny corners. I could use lenses of better and more
even coverage to do the flashing instead of chancing it in the hurried times
when shooting.
Another problem I might have is often there might be no area that would
record as a single tone even with the opal glass as diffuser. I rarely have
any sky when I need to flash and I'm not sure that contrasty wooded scenes
would always work with the diffuser to permit even tones.
 A second question would be about film choice with flashing........Without
over taxing my mind { its already weakened thinking of the possibilities of
flashing on some of my images...:o) } is there a logical film class or type
that might work better or that should be avoided?
 Any idea where in the USA I might get a Wallace disc ......I'll probably
make one as Barry mentions but am curious about the price and possibly
better construction if this works as well as I'm thinking?
 Thanks for the help!
Visions of wonderful shadow detail dancing in my head,
Chuck { just to keep your Chucks straight ....I'm the good looking bald one
with the beard and southern accent! }

Chuck (the good looking one)
The effect of pre-flashing is far greater than water bathing. I haven't used
post flashing, but can see no reason at all why you shouldn't. The important
thing is that the camera is a ready-made device for giving a precise amount
of pre or post flash light. Have no fear about opal glass giving perfectly
even lighting even when pointed at woodland - it does. But I quite
understand that the amount of light may be very low there. I haven't really
done comparisons of different films with the technique. I use it freely and
it does seem to work well with any emulsion I have used, traditional or
special grain. T-Max, I understand, does have advantages in reciprocity
failure.

I had finger problems when I typed last evening's entry. I should have typed
Zone IV and not Zone VI.

A Zone IV shadow placement clearly pushes everything one Zone higher
therefore what I call my normal development is probably equivalent to about
minus 1 stop. I did carry out tests to determine personal development. My
thinking is to give a full exposure to shadows which will record all detail,
including those small dark areas that cannot be metered, even with a spot
meter. For example, imagine the dark edge surrounding a black painted closed
door at the end of a dimly lit corridor. I aim to make that dark edge pure
black in my final print and show the separation between that and the dimly
lit black door. In this imaginary exposure I would meter the darkest part of
the black door and place it on to Zone IV.  The slight reduction in
development has a minimal effect on the shadow areas.

Using the 0 and 5 split grade printing  method together with accurate fstop
timing to 1/10th seconds I can obtain maximum separation in the shadows
sometimes by holding back on soft filtration to allow the grade 5 to give me
that separation. I am simply following the old adage of exposing for the
shadows and developing for the highlights although I do not wish reduce the
density of the negative highlights as much as most photographers. In this
way I produce the high contrast negative with maximum information
throughout. It suits my way of working and evidently it also suits the many
college students and private clients that I have taught over the past 15
years. The great thing about this wonderful obsessive attachment to
photography that we all have is that there are so many different ways to
achieve the result that we are after and not one of them is wrong. It's just
a matter of personal taste.

Les
If you are placing shadows on Zone IV, which seems fine to me, and reducing
development, you won't be getting a high contrast negative. You will be
getting a fairly dense negative with lowered contrast that makes for easy
printing. That is exactly what I recommend - the principle of my 'expose
enough, develop the least' approach. Following the original message about
Barnbaum's technique of allowing the high zones to land where they would on
modern thin emulsion films, I made the point that a tanning or compensating
developer (two bath for instance) kept those highlights nicely printable.
You don't say how much you reduce development. It may not be as much as me
of course. How did you conduct your development time tests? I enquired
yesterday what comparative tests you had run. Could you elaborate? Is this
the same process you wrote about a little time ago when you referred to
contrasty negs being self-masking? Perhaps you could expand on that
technique a little too since it seems to be linked and you didn't respond
about it then.
I understand the point you are making about printing the dark door, and
fully agree with your good technique. How would you go about printing the
dozens of tiny burned out highlights coming through the branches of trees
exposed to place the base of the dark tree trunks on Zone IV in a picture of
a forest without causing a dark halo on the surrounding foliage as discussed
with Chuck Downs yesterday?

John,

It is only a problem when direct sunlight enters the slots at a sharp enough
angle to hit the front surface of the filters. It is no problem as it is
easy to hold your hand over the top. Incidentally I find the Hi-Tec to be
the better engineered holder but  it does not accommodate the various filter
thickness co easily My greatest problem with it though is that the holder is
easily dislodged from the lens adapter ring. The Lee adapter rings have a
profiled rim which prevents that happening.

Steve,

Your idea is very good but will work well only if the gelatin is optical
quality. If the gelatin sheets are meant for lighting there is a strong risk
of image degradation. Hi-Tec make optical quality 'gel' filters as well as
resin and these are much cheaper than the resin.

Plastic card as used by model makers is great for making a surpringly
durable rim for gels and other filters. I have often used it for making
square rims for circular glass filters. All you need are three pieces of
plastic card cut to 100mm sq. One sheet should be the same thickness as the
filter with a circular hole cut in the centre the same diameter as the
filter. The other two sheets should be of much thinner plastic card with the
hole cut about three or four mm. smaller than the filter. Then simply
sandwich it all together using double sided mounting adhesive. Caution:
double sided tape might cause long term problems as the adhesive in it might
continue to work on the plastic and cause distortion.

Any filter needs as much (possibly more especially if there are any
abrasions) protection from stray light as does the front lens element, so a
hood is quite important.

PS. I visit Carmel most years - next time perhaps we could meet.

..just thinking out loud here, and I can be wrong ofcourse: but as I
understand pre-flashing it is done to raise the sensitivty threshold of
the film in order to "pick up" those weak "shadow-photons" which
otherwise wouldn't be recorded. So if they aren't recorded  on a
non-flashed film in the first place, you couldn't bring them back with a
post-flash..?..

Cor,
I may well be wrong, but it would seem logical to assume that as the
film effectively "remembers" what it has seen, it should be as
effective pre or post flashing. (Afterall, the same is true of paper
in the darkroom). It is easy to forget just how much the film really
is sensitive to, primarily because we only think of its sensitivity,
in terms of the way we develop it.
Having said that most texts that deal with the subject seem to stress
Pre Exposure??
Picking up on others comments, the long toe of some films will help.
The TMax's better performance after one second will help.
And the pre flash definitely works. Between zones 0 - 2 are fine. I'm
sure the make of film is unimportant.
Just one note on the in camera approach Barry mentioned. I use it too,
and it does work. However I find that reading the exposure through
exactly the same axis as the lens for exposing the film is very
important. Slight inaccuracies or oversights (for example flare on the
preflsh device) here can have profound effects, in what is otherwise a
predictable procedure.
PS If anyone has done comparative tests of pre V's Post flashing it
would be great to read the results.
Scott.

Dear Richard,

After re-searching my old tech. books, I finally found the formula-

			Chrome alum  20 grams
      sodium or potassium bisulfite  20 grams
			      water   1 liter
soak the film for 4-5 minutes after development and discard after one days use or use as a one shot.

I also found the March 1966 article by Wallace Hanson that explored and exposed the "myths" of  acetic acid stop baths.

thank you for your reply and for your push to make me dig deeper.

			yours stopping to smell the vinegar,

				Garry D. Lewis

..just thinking out loud here, and I can be wrong ofcourse: but as I
understand pre-flashing it is done to raise the sensitivty threshold of
the film in order to "pick up" those weak "shadow-photons" which
otherwise wouldn't be recorded. So if they aren't recorded  on a
non-flashed film in the first place, you couldn't bring them back with a
post-flash..?..

Cor
That activation of the weak shadow photons may or may not happen, but that
would be an insignificant effect compared to the actual occurrence. As with
paper, flashing film before or after has no different effect. With paper,
the amount of flashing is normally below that required to show any tone on
development (though with burned in skies, for example, you can flash enough
to create tone if you wish). But added to the main exposure in the weakest
highlights, it is enough IN TOTAL to print as tone. It makes no difference
whether we add the flash before or after.
With film the amount of flash is in itself usually enough to register as
developed density. So if we were to regard Zone I as 1 unit of light and we
preflash at Zone II, we add 2 units of light to any area of the negative
receiving Zone ! exposure, making a total of 3 units of light. Any area of
the negative receiving Zone II exposure (= 2 units of light), receives a
further 2 making 4 in total. Similarly, Zone III exposure areas receive 6
units in total, Zone IV 10 units, Zone V 18 units, and so on. Thus the
effect of the flash is dramatic in the shadows, little noticeable in the mid
tones, and virtually invisible in the highlights.
It makes no difference whether this added flash exposure happens before or
after the main exposure. That's the theory, and it does stack up with paper
if you actually try it. I just haven't tried it with film because I haven't
had the need. It's far simpler to do it at the time to save having to mark
and reload film. But I can see Chuck's perception that he might need to be
able to do this. In fact, a couple of layers of white plastic shopping bag
wrapped over the lens for preflashing are completely adequate for diffusion,
and don't vignette. It is also light, cheap, and space-saving in the back
pack. It won't feel as good as using a neat device, but it works regardless.

It would seem to me that what pre or post flashing does is push the 
low light response of the flashed media (film or paper) further up the 
toe so that the curve is steeper and the response of low light 
images on the media has greater differential effect or higher 
contrast at when recording low light levels.  The strategy of use 
would be different for paper and film.

Just the way I try to understand it.

I think what we should remember about pre-flashing film is that the film is
made more sensitive to light from the low values of a scene. The low values
are sensitized at a much greater rate than the high values.

Post flash does nothing to cause the low vales to become more sensitive to
the existing light in a scene.

Your profane reply went to everyone on the list and probably not to the

I have to disagree on this one. There is a common misconception that
pre-flashing film 'presensitises' the film and increases its speed. Sorry,
all that happens is that the flash lifts the film to its threshold where any
more exposure at the shadow end of the scale will immediately register as
density after development. It matters not whether that extra little bit of
exposure to lift the shadow areas occurs before or after the main exposure -
it is simply an additive exposure which is proportionately far more in the
shadows than the mid tones and highlights. With film, indeed, it is common
to give so much preflash that it will itself register as developed density.
Presensitisation is a different thing. The speed of the film is increased by
preflashing simply because the shadows respond to light much more quickly
because they have been lifted to threshold level.
Test it pre or post flashing on printing paper, and you will find it to be
true that the effect is identical.
Of course, with post flashing, you can allow partial development before
flashing. This WILL give a different effect.

That's  too bad.  You should either convince your clients to either 
expose properly, find competent processing (I'll do it) or process 
the negs yourself.  I was having simular probs 5 years ago and 
demanded the above from my clients and started offering the 
processing.  Guess what?!?  Not my printing life became a lot easier.

Here is where I may disagree...I have found that it does make a 
difference if it is either pre or post flashing, although we may be 
talking apples and oranges.  It depends on the amount of flash time.

There should be NO difference between pre and post flashing if the 
flashing is simply moving the the initial light sensitivity level further 
up the toe of the sensitivity curve.  

The difference in contrast at any point (or light level) is controlled by 
the characteristic of the media (represented by the the curve) at the 
total light point (flash + image).  The slope of the curve represents 
the contrast.  The steeper the slope the higher the contrast.  

At the toe of the curve, the slope is very gradual so differentiation in 
the media between light levels is very slight(low contrast).  As we 
add light (flashing) we move the total light (flash + image) to a point 
where the slope is steeper and the effect is a contrast increase 
between light levels.

The down side is we have to use a reduced total of the curve for  
recording our images.

If there is an additional mechanism could someone please explain 
it?

Thanks
Stephen

Thanks for the replies on my question on pre or post flashing..seems I
misunderstood the concept. So learned again something new from the list!

So to ask the same question one more time: suppose there is a Zone 0
area (in a given situation)  a trunk tree in a deep shadow: the texture
of the trunk area will not be recorded on film, and no amount of
pre-flashing will bring in this texture, the pre (or post) flash will
only add density to the empty spot of the Zone 0 on the negative,
right..?

Thanks for your time and patience,

Best,

Cor

Sorry about that one, I didn't realize it was a pure silver message I got.
I saw another damn advertising message & hit the autoresponder button which
is programmed for the response that went out on the list.



I have found, however, this response gets me off the spam lists better than
other methods I have tried. The one I responded to was the first spam in
about 3 weeks.

Some say the pre flashing causes the film to be more sensitive while others
say no, it doesn't. Anyone have any solid test results to show one way or
another? Or does it vary from FILM emulsion to emulsion?

No. "Pre-exposure involves giving the negative a first exposure to a uniform
illumination placed on a chosen low zone, after which the normal exposure of
the subject is given. The pre-exposure serves to bring the entire negative
up to the threshold, or moderately above, so that it is sensitized to very
small additional levels of exposure. It will then retain detail in deep
shadow values that would otherwise fall on or below the threshold and
therefore not record." Adams, "The Negative," p. 119.  So in your example,
if you preexposed the film to Zone II, and then placed the tree trunk on
Zone I (or II or whatever), you would record some detail that otherwise
would have been lost. Of course the resulting possible extended exposure
required to place the trunk in Zone I or higher might result in the
highlights ending up at a very high zone, which would have to be dealt with
by contraction in development.

Hello dear list members !
Some times ago, I've read on pub. J109 from Kodak that a minimum of 100
CC of Xtol is needed for one 135 film.
As I mainly use Rodinal, (1+50, normally ) I use something about 20 CC
of this stuff in one liter for 2 120 films. So 10 cc for one 135 film.
If I go to 1+100 or 1+150 with Rodinal, will I hit a limit ?
What could be the practical minimum of chemistry needed for one film ?
And how will I calculate this ?

BTW, Please stop being so precise and so good in your answers. It will
take me two lives to test all the ideas, you've given on this list ! Add
to that the fact that I need to take pictures to have something to test,
and I need another life for that matter alone !
cheers !

  Yes, yes... Are you going to leave it a mystery? IMWTK (inquiring minds
want to know) the source(s) of this arcanae. I have a cold. It is too hot
in LA (a cold in the heat?). I can not endure a mystery in addition.

It seems that the spammers have decided that this would be a good list to
subscribe to and then send their nonsense.  I am out of town right now, but when I get back, I am going
to *close* the list - this means no one new will be able to subscribe
until I personally review and manually approve the request.  This is a
giant pain for me, but is the only way to avoid this kind of garbage.
Unfortunately, they do not use the same return addresses in all cases
or I would should filter them out of the mail system entirely... there
may be a way to do some of this too...I'll have to look into it.

Also, PLEASE, if we do get spammed, don't send your vitriol back to this
list - send it to abuse@domainthespamcamefrom - they can do something about
it.

  Be careful about respondind to e-mail spam. In many cases the addresses
are either generated by a random address generator or are from lists of
addresses scanned from Usenet. When you respond, or ask to be removed from
a list, you confirm that the address is a valid one and you will multiply
the number of spams you get. The best thing is not to reply at all to the
spammer. If you can learn to read headers you can somtimes find the actual
originating ISP and complain to them. Often headers are completely forged
so that it is difficult or impossible to determine the actual source. 
  If you do a web search for spam you will find some good anti-spam pages
and some free anti spam software (along with web sites dedicated to the
processed, meat-like, semi-edible mush sold under this name. I must be
crazy, I like it).

Brian & Barry,

I had finger problems when I typed last evening's entry. I should have typed Zone IV and not Zone VI. 

A Zone IV shadow placement clearly pushes everything one Zone higher therefore what I call my normal development is probably equivalent to about minus 1 stop. I did carry out tests to determine personal development. My thinking is to give a full exposure to shadows which will record all detail, including those small dark areas that cannot be metered, even with a spot meter. For example, imagine the dark edge surrounding a black painted closed door at the end of a dimly lit corridor. I aim to make that dark edge pure black in my final print and show the separation between that and the dimly lit black door. In this imaginary exposure I would meter the darkest part of the black door and place it on to Zone IV.  The slight reduction in development has a minimal effect on the shadow areas. 

Using the 0 and 5 split grade printing  method together with accurate fstop timing to 1/10th seconds I can obtain maximum separation in the shadows sometimes by holding back on soft filtration to allow the grade 5 to give me that separation. I am simply following the old adage of exposing for the shadows and developing for the highlights although I do not wish reduce the density of the negative highlights as much as most photographers. In this way I produce the high contrast negative with maximum information throughout. It suits my way of working and evidently it also suits the many college students and private clients that I have taught over the past 15 years. The great thing about this wonderful obsessive attachment to photography that we all have is that there are so many different ways to achieve the result that we are after and not one of them is wrong. It's just a matter of personal taste.

I don't understand how you get a high contrast negative by placing the
shadows on Zone VI and then developing normally. If you place your shadows
on Zone VI it would  seem to be impossible to produce any dark tones in the
print unless you underdevelop. In my own experience I've found that the
standard zone system advice to place the darkest tones in which you want
detail on Zone III leads to underexposed negatives. In a "normal" scene I've
found that I get better negatives by placing these portions of the scene on
at least Zone III 1/2 and usually IV but never VI unless I'm deliberately
seeking a high key print.

 Could you elaborate a little? I perhaps should add that I've attended one
of Bruce's workshops and read his book "The Art of Photography" so I'm
generally familiar with his theories and approaches, particularly his
"expanded zone system" approach. It's just that I don't recall a suggestion
to place shadows on Zone VI and then develop normally to achieve a high
contrast print (and am too lazy to re-read my workshop notes or the book).
Thanks. Brian

Surely, all controls, no matter how good or bad the negative can only be an
aid to the production of the expressive print. Yes, these and other methods
are used in the salvage operation of printing a poor negative but when used
in conjunction with a well exposed and developed negative the subtleties
possible in the final print will further improve it. I find that there is no
extra effort involved in using any dodge or technique required in making the
fine print, whether that effort is in developing the negative or making the
print. For me it is all in a days work. Printers, are in my view, simply
problem solvers. It is our job to highlight the problem and to find the
solution and if that means using the techniques apparently frowned upon by
Barry then so be it.
>
>  As a matter of interest I always place my shadows on Zone VI and develop
most of my films normally, based on my own tests. The final negative is of
high contrast and I can print it without any loss of quality. The Zone VI
placement of shadows was the result of a very stimulating few days spent
with Bruce Barnbaum a few years ago, when many of the matters that he will
be writing about in forthcoming issues of Photo Techniques were discussed in
interesting and sometimes heated debate. Perhaps the amount of red wine
consumed had a lot to do with the heat of the debate.

Hi Les
Surely the "pre" or "post" application of the white light, is not
going to make any difference to the scenario you have described below.
Pre or post, the effect will be identical. I have to confess that
depending on what order my printing sequence evolves in, I will
happily use both interchangeably. (Surely the sum of both exposures is
exactly the same?),.
What is the subtle difference?
Scott.

Cor.
Referring to assumption below. Wrong.
The pre flashing itself will simply raise the film to the threshold,
with a detail-less veil of what would otherwise be called fog.
But if there is tonal variation or texture on the trunk of the tree,
assuming you give the correct level of pre flash, it will now be
revealed, as its exposure is added to the pre flash . Just go and give
it a try. It will work. (Check out Ansel Adams "The Negative").

Thanks for the replies on my question on pre or post flashing..seems I
misunderstood the concept. So learned again something new from the list!

So to ask the same question one more time: suppose there is a Zone 0
area (in a given situation)  a trunk tree in a deep shadow: the texture
of the trunk area will not be recorded on film, and no amount of
pre-flashing will bring in this texture, the pre (or post) flash will
only add density to the empty spot of the Zone 0 on the negative,
right..?

Cor,
The trouble with Zone 0 is that it may not be actual 0. Greatly
oversimplifying, it is any exposure in the negative which fails to develop
enough density to print as a dark grey that can be seen as different from
black in the print.
So one area of Zone 0 may be totally clear negative other than film base
plus fog. Another area of Zone 0 may be a whisker below the density needed
to print as Zone I. This second area on receiving a preflash at Zone II
would be lifted virtually to Zone II level, and so would at least show hints
of texture.

Where I have to print dozens of tiny burned out highlights I POST flash the
paper. I do not burn in with soft or even grade 2 or 3 filtration, as you so
rightly pointed out grey halos are the order of the day when you go down
that route.

In the situation you describe I often make the original image forming
exposure using a high contrast filter (grade 4 or 5). Together with very
precise timing this will give maximum separation in the trunk but will not
record highlight information on the paper. A careful post flash test will
indicate how much white light to apply to put the highlights just where you
wish to have them.

I am not being pedantic or argumentative but I do believe that there is a
subtle but significant difference between pre and post flashing paper. (I
have never flashed film and find the current thread very informative) My
thinking is that the post flash test on top of an image forming exposure
allows you to see the effect of different white light exposures on the
image. You can then choose the flash exposure which gives the desired
highlight tonality.

Any image forming exposure that has not recorded information on the paper
has partially sensitised the paper. The white light post exposure will
surely push that image forming exposure beyond the threshold.  Imagine a
scale of densities from 1 to  9 where 1 is the thinnest part of the
negative. Image forming exposure is given which records 1 to 5 on the paper.
6 to 9 are still below the threshold. Using post flashing you can push only
1 or all 4 above the threshold depending on how much post flash exposure is
given. I hope that this is reasonably clear. I can demonstrate it on a
darkroom printing workshop very quickly but find it quite difficult to
describe.

Les
I think this is one occasion where split grading may be an easier method.
What an admission from me! However, I don't believe flashing is an answer
for a fine print in the highlights - see my response to Ken Sinclair about
his 'unsafe safelight'.
Flashing pre or post? Unfortunately, all flashing does is to add a small
fixed amount of extra exposure to the main exposure. Where areas of the
negative are too dense to reach the threshold of density on the print when
developed, this flash may be enough to lift them above the threshold so that
they do produce density. In the mid tone areas, the difference in print
density from this extra exposure is much less proportionately. It matters
not whether the flash is before or after main exposure. It's just a fixed
amount of extra exposure That's verified by comparative densitometer
readings of each method. There's no difference.
Any info on the self masking of contrasty negs. you mentioned Les?

 I have followed this thread with great interest. I would have thought that 
the main difference in pre and post flash, for paper, comes in the fact that 
you can do a test strip for post flashing to see how much is needed to bring 
in the difficult small highlights, and observe the effect on the rest of your 
values.Is this not the reason for post flashing, Les? Saffron.

 I have followed this thread with great interest. I would have thought that
the main difference in pre and post flash, for paper, comes in the fact that
you can do a test strip for post flashing to see how much is needed to bring
in the difficult small highlights, and observe the effect on the rest of
your
values.Is this not the reason for post flashing, Les?

Hi Saffron
I know you were commenting to Les, so please forgive this interruption. I
had never thought of this obvious point before. It does make practical
sense.

Barry,

Where I have to print dozens of tiny burned out highlights I POST flash the paper. I do not burn in with soft or even grade 2 or 3 filtration, as you so rightly pointed out grey halos are the order of the day when you go down that route. 

In the situation you describe I often make the original image forming exposure using a high contrast filter (grade 4 or 5). Together with very precise timing this will give maximum separation in the trunk but will not record highlight information on the paper. A careful post flash test will indicate how much white light to apply to put the highlights just where you wish to have them. 

I am not being pedantic or argumentative but I do believe that there is a subtle but significant difference between pre and post flashing paper. (I have never flashed film and find the current thread very informative) My thinking is that the post flash test on top of an image forming exposure allows you to see the effect of different white light exposures on the image. You can then choose the flash exposure which gives the desired highlight tonality. 

Any image forming exposure that has not recorded information on the paper has partially sensitised the paper. The white light post exposure will surely push that image forming exposure beyond the threshold.  Imagine a scale of densities from 1 to  9 where 1 is the thinnest part of the negative. Image forming exposure is given which records 1 to 5 on the paper. 6 to 9 are still below the threshold. Using post flashing you can push only 1 or all 4 above the threshold depending on how much post flash exposure is given. I hope that this is reasonably clear. I can demonstrate it on a darkroom printing workshop very quickly but find it quite difficult to describe.

Greetings-

> prints.  What should I look for?  Where?  How much? any suggestions?

Well, you might contact someone like EP Levine in Boston - they deal in all
manner of used equipment and would likely have an 8x10 or two in their
warehouse full of stuff.... You might also contact Jack Darrow at F/Stop
Camera in Akron, OH (330-867-8710) - always a good source of used equipment.

But Lord, do you know what you're getting in to?!?  Some of the older ones
I've seen would require a truck to bring home, and three men and boy to
carry in and setup.  Some of them are upwards of seven feet tall and have
chain pulls to operate the focus and head height mechanisms!

This isn't always the case with newer modern versions, but then you'd be
talking a pretty penny, even if silver is soon to become an alternate
process.

Are you anywhere near a college or university, or a commercial facility that
you can hook up with and rent some darkroom time on one already in place?
For instance, last summer I used the one at Visual Studies in Rochester, NY
evenings while teaching a class there - great fun!

Good luck!

One thing to try, which is similar to the anti-UV glass, is non-glare glass,
used by picture framers, that is acid etched on one side only.  The etched
side goes in contact with the back side of the film.  It gives a small
amount of diffusion and a loss of about 1/4 to 1/2 stop of printing speed.
Tru-View is one brand of the glass available in the US.  There are probably
others.  The glass should not be too expensive since it  is about $3 for a
16x20 sheet, case lots, FOB warehouse.

Does the print seems more 'grainy'? Just wondering if the etched side
increases the apparent grain by being placed in contact with the film, as it
will probably also be in focus when the lens is stopped down.

If you are going to use glazing that is anti reflection you want to stay
away from the etched glass. It will give the etch pattern on your print.
Instead, use the coated anti reflection glass as it has no etched pattern to
interfere with print sharpness.

Re: enlarging 8x10.
A friend and I had some success rigging a light source from an x-ray viewer to
the back of my 8x10 camera.  Better than nothing but only slightly so.

To Mr. McLean; Mr.Thornton and everyone:

[I have keep all the responses in regarding my questions about taining
developer/zone VI enlarger below, just in case you need reference
about what I am trying to say.]

In answer Mr. Thorton's concern:
I am pretty sure my the DiXactol dilution is correct. temperature is OK
(constant at 'my 21"c/70"F ')  and the fressness of DiXactol should be OK
too as it was opened 5 days ago.

Mr. Thorton asked: "Is the part A concentrate a pale straw colour, or is it
a stronger tint?"
I think, I would say it is a pale straw color.(but not very pale)

After doing expose 21 steps tablet on film and confirmed that I need
18 minutes to achieve N development. I did a filed test on my back yard
and open a sealed new DiXactol to develop this negative. Yes, 18 minutes
is the correct N development for printing (oriental) VC-FB papers with Zone
VI enlarger when the green/blue lamps both are set at Max. The print I got
shows full tonal range from Zone III-VII, beautiful highlight separation
between ZoneVII/VIII/IX. Overall contrast is still a bit LOW(But this is
a personal taste, I think) , But additional few seconds of blue lamp only
exposures make things much better, image's internal/local contrast raise
quickly. 

Actually, I am happy with DiXactol so far, except the long developing time.
When I am using PMK(which also needs a long developing time), I am unable
to pump up contrast (with Zone VI enlarger). DiXactol seems does a better
job on this regard. I would guess this is because DiXactol's stain is
brown/less yellow.

I guess what happened that I need such long developing time either for
DiXactol or PMK is the lamps in Zone VI enlarger! The green lamp is
much stronger than the blue one in Zone VI enlarger, and as such, when
set both Green/Blue lamps on, though both are at Max. actually there are
more green light than blue hit papers.
And then, the stains, especially PMK's yellow/green stain, make things worse
becasue the whole combination become strong green/ little blue light with
strong yellow stained negatives. And the longer I develop in PMK, the more
yellow stains I get, and it then lower contrast when using Zone VI enlarger
, I never get contrast I need (later these days, I use chemical additive to
raise contrast)
----------------
Also:
After confirmed 18minutes/single sheet 8x10/tray/70"F development is correct
as N Dev. for Zone VI enlarger. I decided to try using JOBO and at higher
temperature( 24"c/75"F), I found there are something interesting:

What I do:
1. 21step tablet taped on films
2. expose film by shooting at a light box (EV=13 which is place on Zone X
and Zone XII)), EI at 400
3. 2 sheets of films are exposed.
 ( The above are exactly same as what I did when I try single sheet tray
dev.)

4. These two sheets 8x10 are placed in JOBO 3005 expert tank
5. develop at 24"C/75"F/ 40RPM roate speed, developing time
    10 minutes(5 minute x2)
    12 minutes(6 minute x2)
    14 minutes(7 minute x2)
    18 minutes(9 minute x2)
    21.5 minutes(10 +11.5 minutes)
    26 minutes(13 minute x2)
DiXactol diultion is 4+28+1200ml(1+7+300), pour in 616ml first
and exchange for another 616 midway (that's way I said X minutes x2)

I havn't print these negatives yet, but even the one that was developed for
26 minutes in JOBO, by looking at it, doesn't achieves high enough density
that I can get by tray development(18 minutes). actually, I found 21.5
minutes and 26 minutes look to have same highest densities, though the 26
minutes has better shadow and midtone separation.
All films developed in JOBO have EI that is well above 400.

What I can think of what make JOBO and tray development these difference
are:
1.In tray developments, films are always covered by solution, In JOBO there
are not
2.In tray, 1232ml DiXactol for one sheet of film, In JOBO, 616ml
   DiXactol for 2 sheets of films

Just think it might be an interesting 'discovery' for people who want to do
extreme N- development.

Would like to have any input.(I hope I did something wrong, otherwise
I am thinking sending ZoneVI VX head back to Calumet for checking it)
Thanks

Best,
C.J. Cheng

Mr Cheng,
In newer packs of Dixactol, the advice has changed with regards to
processing temperature. Initially advice was for 21C, now however,
same times are advised at 24C. This does seem to give the neg a bit
more guts.
Good luck
Scott.

I did try this type of glass for a substitute neg. carrier glass, but the
one I tried unfortunately showed the etched glass surface in the print.
Maybe there are some non-glare glass with less prominent etching though.

One thing to try, which is similar to the anti-UV glass, is non-glare glass,
used by picture framers, that is acid etched on one side only.  The etched
side goes in contact with the back side of the film.  It gives a small
amount of diffusion and a loss of about 1/4 to 1/2 stop of printing speed.
Tru-View is one brand of the glass available in the US.  There are probably
others.  The glass should not be too expensive since it  is about $3 for a
16x20 sheet, case lots, FOB warehouse.

Dear Mr. Cheng
Thanks for this useful information. I am sorry, but there still seems to be
something wrong here somewhere. By this length of development the negatives
should be just about unprintable. Without being close at hand to check each
variable, it is impossible to give specific advice. If you are also having
similar trouble with PMK then it suggests you are inadvertently printing at
far too low a contrast - like 0 or 00. I wonder if your enlarger head is
behaving as it should? I am sure you have already checked out your
thermometer too. I have four high quality ones. Each reads differently with
a total variation of 5C, so you may understand why I raise the point.
Otherwise, I am at a loss.

Barry Thornton

Subject: Re: DiXactol question/Zone VI VC enlarger


To Mr. McLean; Mr.Thornton and everyone:

[I have keep all the responses in regarding my questions about taining
developer/zone VI enlarger below, just in case you need reference
about what I am trying to say.]

In answer Mr. Thorton's concern:
I am pretty sure my the DiXactol dilution is correct. temperature is OK
(constant at 'my 21"c/70"F ')  and the fressness of DiXactol should be OK
too as it was opened 5 days ago.

Mr. Thorton asked: "Is the part A concentrate a pale straw colour, or is it
a stronger tint?"
I think, I would say it is a pale straw color.(but not very pale)

After doing expose 21 steps tablet on film and confirmed that I need
18 minutes to achieve N development. I did a filed test on my back yard
and open a sealed new DiXactol to develop this negative. Yes, 18 minutes
is the correct N development for printing (oriental) VC-FB papers with Zone
VI enlarger when the green/blue lamps both are set at Max. The print I got
shows full tonal range from Zone III-VII, beautiful highlight separation
between ZoneVII/VIII/IX. Overall contrast is still a bit LOW(But this is
a personal taste, I think) , But additional few seconds of blue lamp only
exposures make things much better, image's internal/local contrast raise
quickly.

Actually, I am happy with DiXactol so far, except the long developing time.
When I am using PMK(which also needs a long developing time), I am unable
to pump up contrast (with Zone VI enlarger). DiXactol seems does a better
job on this regard. I would guess this is because DiXactol's stain is
brown/less yellow.

I guess what happened that I need such long developing time either for
DiXactol or PMK is the lamps in Zone VI enlarger! The green lamp is
much stronger than the blue one in Zone VI enlarger, and as such, when
set both Green/Blue lamps on, though both are at Max. actually there are
more green light than blue hit papers.
And then, the stains, especially PMK's yellow/green stain, make things worse
becasue the whole combination become strong green/ little blue light with
strong yellow stained negatives. And the longer I develop in PMK, the more
yellow stains I get, and it then lower contrast when using Zone VI enlarger
, I never get contrast I need (later these days, I use chemical additive to
raise contrast)
----------------
Also:
After confirmed 18minutes/single sheet 8x10/tray/70"F development is correct
as N Dev. for Zone VI enlarger. I decided to try using JOBO and at higher
temperature( 24"c/75"F), I found there are something interesting:

What I do:
1. 21step tablet taped on films
2. expose film by shooting at a light box (EV=13 which is place on Zone X
and Zone XII)), EI at 400
3. 2 sheets of films are exposed.
 ( The above are exactly same as what I did when I try single sheet tray
dev.)

4. These two sheets 8x10 are placed in JOBO 3005 expert tank
5. develop at 24"C/75"F/ 40RPM roate speed, developing time
    10 minutes(5 minute x2)
    12 minutes(6 minute x2)
    14 minutes(7 minute x2)
    18 minutes(9 minute x2)
    21.5 minutes(10 +11.5 minutes)
    26 minutes(13 minute x2)
DiXactol diultion is 4+28+1200ml(1+7+300), pour in 616ml first
and exchange for another 616 midway (that's way I said X minutes x2)

I havn't print these negatives yet, but even the one that was developed for
26 minutes in JOBO, by looking at it, doesn't achieves high enough density
that I can get by tray development(18 minutes). actually, I found 21.5
minutes and 26 minutes look to have same highest densities, though the 26
minutes has better shadow and midtone separation.
All films developed in JOBO have EI that is well above 400.

What I can think of what make JOBO and tray development these difference
are:
1.In tray developments, films are always covered by solution, In JOBO there
are not
2.In tray, 1232ml DiXactol for one sheet of film, In JOBO, 616ml
   DiXactol for 2 sheets of films

Just think it might be an interesting 'discovery' for people who want to do
extreme N- development.

Would like to have any input.(I hope I did something wrong, otherwise
I am thinking sending ZoneVI VX head back to Calumet for checking it)
Thanks

Best,
C.J. Cheng

I still use 21 because I expose fully. The increase was to compensate the
hundreds of users who underexpose slightly all the time by using the
automatic setting on their 35mm cameras I am afraid. because of the tanning
action in the highlights the heavier negs are still easily printable. The
sort of time Mr. Cheng is using is way beyond this kind of variation. It
really is baffling. It is as if he is printing all the time on grade 00.
Yet, as Les McLean reported, the enlarger is not especially soft in its
rendering. Most peculiar. At my standard time of 8 minutes at 21 for HP5
Plus in medium format, 'normal' subject brightness range negatives print
beautifully on grade 2. Sheet film usually needs a little more. I know of a
couple of users working at 9 minutes, but 18 minutes is double that. the
fact that PMK is demanding extra long times hints at the cause of the
problem being independent of the developer.

Mr Cheng,
In newer packs of Dixactol, the advice has changed with regards to
processing temperature. Initially advice was for 21C, now however,
same times are advised at 24C. This does seem to give the neg a bit
more guts.
Good luck
Scott.

Have used this glass for contact printing only.  The etch pattern does not
show up in the print and is only enough to give some surface roughness to
reduce glare.  Might be a problem with enlargements. Just have to try the
particular glass that you can get.  The surface roughness gives enough air
space to put the kibosh on Newton's Rings.  Quite a few of the glass A-N
slide mounts have the same type of glass in them.

  There's an 8x10 Elwood in fairly decent condition at The Photo Connection
in Orlando Fla. at a rather cheap price. 1-888-664-0076, ask for Toni.
  It needs a new head; it has the old parabolic head and the diffusion
plate has a melted spot.
  No way you want to ship this thing, but if you're not too far away it may
be worth the drive....in a U-haul truck. <g>

Dear Mr. Thornton,

That's what I think. I recall about one year ago, there was one person
posted on usernet that he has problem with Zone VI VC head( he claimed
he never be able to get over 3 1/2 even he use blue lamp only). I never
thought it will happen to me....,

I had just printed the step tablet that was developed 18 minutes by exposing
it blue lamp only, and I got 11 steps between pure black and pure white. 2
steps are 1 stop/1 EV, so there are 5 f-stops tonal range rendered EVEN it
was exposed by Blue lamp only. I think it confirms the VC head I have has
something wrong....

Yes, I did check temperture. I use 3 in JOBO (one come with JOBO
I put two more), one at end, one near motor. The differences between
them within 0.5"C. Room temperature is 22"C.

I am going to send that Zone VI VC head back to Calumet. I always
thought it was PMK's stain makes me need long dev. time. But now
I think the answer is there.

I have no regret went through these troubles, I am very interested in
the different results between tray and JOBO development. I think I will
continue working on the JOBO/Dixactol by using different dilution;
sheet/volume ratio to see what it can do for extreme N- development (because
lower contrast yet getting higher EI than tray development, I think this
will still holds true even I had my Zone VI fixed). I will report more if I
do find something worth of mention to you.

Thank you very much for try to help me out. much appreciated!

PS: I had used the post-flash method (expose paper by dim light
when paper was developed half way in developer) that you mention
in your book. It is very useful. (I haven't use it for a while since I got
the Zone VI enlarger when I came to the US), I like its effect better than
flash papers under enlarger.

Again, thank for all the helps, Mr. Thornton and Mr. McLean.

With all the best,
C.J. Cheng

I have been subscribed to this list for close to two years, but to this point 
have been mainly a lurker. Hopefully I can contribute something of value to 
this thread.

I have a Zone 6 enlarger (first version) and am a long time user of PMK Pyro 
with 4x5 Ilford HP5+. I shoot HP5+ at ASA 250 and my "normal" developing time 
(in trays) in 9 minutes. 

With Mr Cheng's comments in mind, I ran some tests on my enlarger this 
evening. First I set my enlarger's 4x5 negative stage at 25" above the table 
top, then set the lens flange of the 150mm lens for 17" above the table top. 
I opened the lens to f5.6. I set the "hard" light of the enlarger to maximum, 
and took a reading off an 18% gray card (sitting on the table top) with my 
Zone 6 modified Pentax digital spot meter. The reading was 2. Then I repeated 
this procedure with the "soft" light, and the reading was 1. 

So the results I got would indicate that if Mr Cheng's enlarger is working 
properly,
he should be getting a similar reading - namely that the "hard" light is 
roughly one stop brighter than the "soft" light, when set to maximum.

Incidentally, I have been very pleased with the performance of my enlarger - 
and using PMK Pyro, HP5+, split filter printing and VC papers has been a very 
successful combination for me and my b/w photography over the years.

I think I am the one who had (and always has) problems with a Zone VI VC Head.
I insert one of the contrib I sent one year ago. Calumet never fixed the
problem, they just stop to answer. I even sent an email and a fax to
Kathy Houde but never got an answer.
The head was send two times but never fixed. I think they don't have any more
the right people to do the job.
They all went away.
If you need some more info, feel free to ask.
The only way to print is to use split filter...

Here is a description I sent a year ago:

First problem:

When I enlarged some 5x7" negatives with the Zone VI VC Head Type 2 and
a 210 mm Rodenstock Rodagon lens, I found some mottling on all prints,
much easier to see in high values. (The prints are snow landscapes, so a
lot of high values). The lens aperture was 11, I made new prints at 8
and 5,6 and the mottling were present but not so sharp.
I checked the diffusion screen of the head and the mottling is in the
screen (they use two and the mottling is in both). I think with such a
lens the diffusion screen is not far enough from the lens and in on
focus with the negative.
I think the best solution is to remove both screens ant to use good
quality ones without mottling ot texture.

Secon problem:
I was using for many years a Zone VI enlarger with a Zone VI VC Head
Type 1 modified by Zone VI (the first version was not working properly
and I had to send it back but 3 months later I got a modified version
working as a dream).
When I began to use a 5x7 view camera I discovered there was a really
big fall off in the corners and on the sides. I upgrade my Type 1
enlarger for a Type 2 with a much bigger head and so no more fall off.

As soon as I got the new head I tested its possibilities against the
ones of the old one.
Again the VC Head was not working properly. After a lot of faxes,
questions, answers, tests, curves etc. I sent it back to Calumet.
Three weeks later, the head was back with the same problem.
I made new tests, send the curves and they agreed it was not working
as it should and ask me to send it back. I did it and waited for 4
months.
I got it back this ten days ago, made same tests and the problem is exactly
the same, except now the head is scratched everywhere and the foam pad
is very badly glued so light is leaking everywhere.
         Calumet technicians take care of customers properties.
What is the problem with that head supposed to be Variable Contrast:
On the control box there 2 knobs: one to adjust the outpout of the
green (soft) light and the other to adjust the outpout of the blue
light (hard). Each of them can be shut off and you have only the other
one. By mixing the outpout of each light you are supposed to get
different paper grades from a vc paper.
Here are the results with Brilliant VC II Paper developped in Zone VI
developper 1+3 for 2 minutes. I used Stouffer 4x5" 21 steps steptablet
by projection and measured results with an XRite 400 densitometer
calibrated just before measuring.

     Hard off and Soft Max: ES = 1.7 grade 0
     Hard mini and Soft Max: ES = 1.13 grade 2
     Hard D and Soft Max: ES = 098 grade 2
     Hard and Soft Max: ES = 0.9 grade 3
     Hard Max and Soft D: ES = 0.85 grade 3
     Hard Max and Soft mini: ES = 0.8 grade 3 1/2
     Hard Max and Soft off: ES = 0.67 grade 4

So with both lights on you can only get from grade 2 to grade 3 1/2
With one light off you get a grade 0 or a grade 4 but no way to adjust
something in-between grade 2 and 0 or 3 1/2 and 4.
I you want these possibilities you need to put some filters under the
lens.

Hello Richard,

    Some others information for stopping baths from the Glafkides book :
    chrome alum is a double sulphate of chrome and potassium ( Cr2(SO4)3 +
K2SO4 + 24 H2O ) of pink colour
first formula water 1l + 30g chrome alum stir the film just for few seconds
second formula water 1l + 30g chrome alum + 60g of anhydrous potassium
sulphate stir for 3 to 5 min
Both baths need to be discarded when the colour is green yellow usually
after few days. Use only below 30C.
Ions chrome give a complex with the gelatine and decrease the number of
polar groups so the swelling of the gelatine is decreased.

    Good luck

        Daniel

Hello Rob,

When I read your message, I know something truely is wrong with my
enlarger! I use MetroLux timer which has a sensor to measure light
output. So, based on my experience, I do know that a one second blue/hard
only is about 2-3 times longer than a one second green/soft only.(that's why
I said, in my previous post, green light is much strong than blue light in
my enlarger)

I would like to thank you for your help of providing EI reading on the Zone
VI enlarger. It is a big help.
I did the same after read your message. Well, same as you, I use a
Zone 6 modified Pentax digital spot meter. But:

On my enlarger, Green only/ Blue only (each set max.) ratio:
Green light only: 2 EV (may be 1 5/6 EV)
Blue light only : 1 EV
(yes, I repeated doing it)

Very diffrent from yours....

Is there any other member in this mailing list also use Zone VI enlarger?
Could you kindly provide such measurement like Mr. McKay did ?
I would like to gather more data so Calumet can get an idea what's wrong
with my enlarger? ( I am not going to do something else, I just want my
enlarger fixed; bring it back to 'normal' and I will pay the service fee.
Nor I will spread message over newsgroup.  I assume Calumet should have a
test standard to tell what's the problem from my enlarger, but just in case
they need some information. Sometimes, my English makes thing
difficult....). Thanks in advance for any helps.

Thank you, Mr. McKay.

With all the best.
C.J. Cheng

Hi again-

>I am in Phoenix, Az...  Any one know of a closer 8x10 negative enlarger?

Check at the Center for Creative Photography in Tucson (Univ of Arizona).
They have a big photo program and quite possibly would have one.  If they
don't they may know someone nearby who does.

Good luck - JB

Photographic Systems in Albuquerque almost always seems to list several sale
in their "View Camera" magazine ad. I don't know how far Albuquerque is from
Phoenix but it's got to be closer than Orlando.

Check with someone like Darkroom Innovations in the PHX area.  Photographic
Systems in Albuquerque NM also have some big equipment.  I think that there
was a Saltzman 10x10 on e-bay reciently.  It needed a 10 foot ceiling and
weighed about 1000 lb. if memory serves me correctly  Yep they are all big
and heavy.  Also, did you measure the floor to ceiling distance in your
darkrooom?   The minimum distance that you will need for a 1:1 (ie 8x10 from
an 8x10 neg) print with a 12 inch lens is 48 inches negative to easel
distance. With something like an old Elwood , add  about 24 inches for the
old parabolic head and  you are looking at 6ft!  For a 16x20 print with a 14
inch lens, things start to bang into an eight foot ceiling with the paper on
the floor.  A cold light head will save about a foot but things still use a
lot of vertical space.  Does not matter if old or new.  The optics do not
change.  

Good luck hunting monsters!

     Howard F. Efner

You may want to check their web site (http://www.pgsys.com), they always
seem to have some sort of sale going on. Right now it's on barrel lenses...

Thanks for the views on enlargers it gave me
reassurance. I was in the process of buying an De-Vere
from Brookside Photograhic in Nottingham UK,
unfortunately the owner died last week from an heart
attack. I have only used the shop a few times in the
past but each time came away with useful advice, a sad
loss.
I now have a LPL 54xx enlarger, wall mount, colour
head. I will hopefully be finished the darkroom and
start using it within a week. I will be ordering a
glass negative carrier for it as it came with masks.

Thank You
Richard Saunders

There are not "explicit" filtration numbers for any one specific enlarger... 
Ilford has a suggested filtration chart in their  B&W papers

Dear C.J. Cheng,

Without being scientific and in order to make sure that your negatives are 
properly exposed and developed, I suggest that you just make a contact print 
on a #2 paper and expose with enough light to make the borders (unexposed 
parts of the neg) at or close to (maximum) black.
Then, if the copy is OK, the neg is OK and the enlargment should be OK with 
any enlarger with the right filtration or paper grade choice.

If your development time is 2x the normally suggested, the neg would normally 
give a very hard contact print on #2 paper.

If the enlarger gives a different print (with normal filtration) than the 
contact print, your problem is with the enlarger,

Hope this helps.

I have been told by several scanner operators that the spray can cause a
pattern on the prints { or in their case scans} if enlargements are made and
that it leaves a residue on the back of the negative often. There used to be
a powder also for use but both are supposed to be for contact printing and
not photo grade.
I never used either myself due to the warnings. The spray does come with the
warning.

 I did the same after read your message. Well, same as you, I use a
 Zone 6 modified Pentax digital spot meter. But:
 
 On my enlarger, Green only/ Blue only (each set max.) ratio:
 Green light only: 2 EV (may be 1 5/6 EV)
 Blue light only : 1 EV >>
=======================================
Mr. Cheng,

Just to further confirm our findings, I ran the same test with my enlarger 
(at the same settings) this evening using a white sheet of paper in place of 
the 18% gray card. Using the Pentax Digital meter, I found the "hard" (blue) 
light light to read approximately 1 stop brighter than the "soft" (green) 
light at 3 different brightnesses, "Maximum", "D" and "Minimum".  Each 
reading was taken with the opposite  light switched off. Both lights seemed 
to be balanced quite well - the difference in brightness between then seemed 
to be about the same at the different settings.

I think the idea (mentioned by someone else) of doing a printing test on 
graded #2 paper (not variable contrast) is a good one - it should at least 
get you in the general area of a properly exposed and developed negative.

Best Regards,

Rob McKay

  A couple of notes on Elwood enlargers. Until about 1947 they used
silvered reflectors. These are often badly tranished. The later enlargers
used vacuum deposited aluminum which is more like ly to be in good
condition. The shape of the reflectors was also changed to even out the
light. The enlargers used several sheets of diffusion glass. One of these
is graduated from center to edge, being more heavily sand blasted in the
center, again to even out the light. Many of the older units were upgraded
to the later type of reflector.
  8x10s came in two varieties. The C-2, a manual focus enlarger, and an
autofocus version. The older manual focus enlargers have a counterweight
running down the back, post WW-2 enlargers have spring counterweights. The
autofocus machine uses a compressed spring in a long column which is part
of the head support. 
  Elwood enlargers were relatively low cost and not nearly as elegant as a
Saltzman or Devere, but they are workable. The Aristo head for the 8x10 or
5x7 machines is fairly expensive but overall probably more satisfactory
than the original heads.

  Shhh...I still have Toni convinced that it won't fit in my Jeep. Although
I do have an 8x10 camera and no enlarger... <g>

Hi Wendy
I don't know which Meopta enlarger you have, but they are a good choice made
for practical use, not just good looks (in fact, not even good looks!). I
have a Meopta Magnafax for daily professional use for over 10 years now.
Very little has gone wrong. Meopta enlargers are sturdy and have some good
adjustments for lens/negative stage alignment or for deliberate distortion
from square with the baseboard using the Scheimflug principle (if you ever
want to get into that sort of thing).
An important point - make sure the negative carrier is used with glasses,
not the glassless inserts, otherwise you will not get properly sharp
pictures. Meopta make a very full range of very reasonably priced parts and
accessories. Negative carrier glasses and masks for all neg. sizes are
readily available. The best combination is a lower glassless mask, and an
upper anti-Newton's rings glass. The accurate rangefinder built into the
Meopta negative carrier is only accurate, though, if you use either both
glasses, or both glassless masks. Not if you you use the hybrid method I
suggest
You can also fit a 6x9 light box to the head and use this for all smaller
negative sizes. there is ample light output, and the light coverage is very
even this way.
The filters in the Meopta Colour head use the Agfa standard of filtration.
Unfortunately, Ilford do not show combinations of Agfa filters that give
'constant speed' printing as they do with the Kodak and Durst standard
filters used with most other enlargers. What this means is that you would
have to make another test strip to check proper print exposure if you change
contrast grade. Actually, the claims for the 'constant speed' of the other
types are overblown, and you would need new test strips with these too,
though the change in exposure time would tend to be less.
So here are the filter values to set using Ilford Multigrade paper - not a
bad place to start because the standard, warm and cool tone options with
this paper.
Grade 00 - 150 yellow; grade 0 - 90 yellow; grade 1/2 - 70 yellow; grade 1 -
55 yellow; grade 11/2 - 30 yellow; grade 2 - no filters; grade 21/2 - 20
magenta; grade 3 - 40 magenta; grade 31/2 - 65 magenta; grade 4 - 85 magenta;
grade 41/2 - 200 magenta. You do not have enough strength in magenta
filtration to achieve grade 5. In fact I think you only get 180 magenta with
the Meopta colour head, so you cannot actually get true grade 41/2. However,
this is still pretty hard contrast with Ilford paper and should be enough
for your needs.
The cyan filter has no effect whatsoever on paper contrast grade, but you
can use it as a neutral density filter to reduce light output for small
prints and thin negatives.
You should be aware that Meopta make a really effective Variable Contrast
head at a very reasonable price, but which lacks nothing over heads of many
times the price. It has stepless grades from 0 - 5 with Ilford paper, an
instant white light lever, and stepless but calibrated variable neutral
density up to 2 stops to adjust the length of exposure time to one that is
convenient for working with the print in hand. The grade settings, accurate
for Ilford, aren't quite right for Agfa paper, but are so close that it
makes no difference.
For other papers with greatly different grade filters, you can use the split
grade  printing approach which others prefer as standard, but I don't unless
I have to.

Hope this helps Wendy.

Good idea Jan. However, it would be important not to use VC paper or the
same problem would occur if the problem was with the VC head. Graded paper,
either for contact or enlargement with a minimum time for maximum black
through rebates exposure, would be a good check.

Dear C.J. Cheng,

Without being scientific and in order to make sure that your negatives are
properly exposed and developed, I suggest that you just make a contact print
on a #2 paper and expose with enough light to make the borders (unexposed
parts of the neg) at or close to (maximum) black.
Then, if the copy is OK, the neg is OK and the enlargment should be OK with
any enlarger with the right filtration or paper grade choice.

If your development time is 2x the normally suggested, the neg would
normally
give a very hard contact print on #2 paper.

If the enlarger gives a different print (with normal filtration) than the
contact print, your problem is with the enlarger,

Hope this helps.

Usually, T-Max film contrast will drop to N-2 with a red filter, N
contrast is retained
with a green filter, and contrast is increased to N+1 with a blue filter.
"Older" films 
do not respond the same way. Adams had noted that with Tri-X, red
filtration 
increased contrast (N+1), green had little effect, and blue decreased
contrast 
(N-1). Plus-X behaves in a similar fashion.

The contrast differences are not due to color relationships in the scene
being 
photographed, but will be evident if a gray scale is photographed, or a
gray card 
at different exposures. The variation is probably due to an imbalance in
the degree
of spectral sensization vs. crystal size/speed.

To test for the effect, and determine accurate factors for different
scene colors 
and lighting, one can photograph a MacBeth color checker chart with
different filters 
while bracketing exposures. A homemade alternative is to use strips of
paint store
color samples which vary in tonality (light to dark) and color (RGBCMY &
gray scale
from black to white). A reference chart can be made from the samples, and
it may be 
photographed in direct sunlight, skylight/shadow and tunsten light to
determine contrast 
variation, filter effects on different colors and exposure factors for
different films. 
Small B&W prints and a color print of the chart can be put together into
a field reference 
booklet.

For more exact corrections, development time may be altered to match
contrast in the
of the gray scale patches. After the development time contrast correction
for the filter is determined, the usual zone testing for film speed using
different filters under different 
light sources may be used to get accurate factors (don't use the chart). 

I'd suggest metering with an incident meter or  gray card for
consistency. If that isn't
possible, meter the scene directly (without a filter on the camera) and
apply factors.
Metering through a filter creates more problems than it solves. 

Although this is a lot of work, the data collected does permit one to
recognizepotential
problems which invariably lead to underexposed wrecks or contrast ranges
which
aren't printable.

in overall contrast even if I braked around the filter index for example
from factor2 to 4 or 5. Did some one has observed the same think and should
I modify the development time? This is more dramatic with new films like T

different for the new films.

Daniel,

You've really got me thinking now.  For my outdoor work, I frequently use a 
#29 red filter, coupled with either Plus-X or TechPan 120's.  Over the last 
few years, I have come to realize that I am much happier with my prints when 
using a #31/2 or #4 printing filter.  I had been assuming that it's just 
because I like lots of contrast (that may still be the real reason), but now 
I wonder.  Of course, it would be hard to call Plus-X a "new generation" film.

I used to have the same problem with red filters. The clouds always seemed
to come out a light gray instead of white and sometimes the entire
photograph was considerably underexposed. Then I read an article in "View
Camera" magazine that suggested  taking a meter reading through the filter
and opening up three more stops from the meter reading. It sounds like this
would grossly overexpose but it tried it and it has worked well for me. I've
also noticed, without doing any scientific tests, that T Max film doesn't
seem to respond to yellow, orange, and red filters as well as other films
(HP5+ in my case).

It is closer to green in it's response in daylight. Again, if this is
your
primary filter (often recommended to get a uniform panchro response),
test it under different lighting. The reason it enhances texture in most 
outdoor photos is its ability to block skylight (blue fill light). If
shadow 
values are important, exposures longer than than the daylight factor
will be required.

Testing can be complicated if you want to get control over the
different effects with different films. Photographing a reflection
step wedge or gray scale can give clues to development adjustments,
(primarily film-filter interation) and the effect of different light
color 
temperatures on "speed" or factors should be intuitive after a test or
two (mostly filter-light interaction).

Meters don't respond to light the same way film does regardless of
claims (Zone VI), so I try to avoid introducing another problem by not
metering through the filter. With "old" films (Tri-X, Plus-X) the filter
effect
was on contrast wasn't too great (N+1 for red; less fo yellow) and was
in the "right" direction, in the sense that most people were looking for
increased contrast. When shadow values dropped out, the gray scale 
contrast increase sort of filled in the overall scale. With T-Max, it
isn't
going to happen with a red filter. I use green filters a lot more than I
once
did.

To richard et all,

Sorry for the delay of this reply, but a few Dr. type had to poke and probe for a while and it was my turn. Only they know what their looking for and
they aren't through looking yet and not telling what they've found.

The whole article that started it off in '66 was-

	The Great Stopbath Squabble by Wallace Hanson; Popular Photography; March 1966; pg.84.

There was a similar article that year in Modern Photography or Petersens' Photographic- but I don't have that issue any longer.

Some other references are contained in--

	Photographic Facts and Formulas by Wall and Jordan; 1940; pg. 100.
	
	Modern Developing Methods for Prints and Fine Grain by The Edwal Laboratories, Inc..; 1939; pg. 10. 

	Champlin on Fine Grain by Harry Champlin; 1938; Second Edition; pg. 108.

In The Negative (Basic Photo 2) by Ansel Adams; 1968; pg.s 91-92- He make mention of the use of a chrome alum stopbath for "miniature" films but gives
no formula.

And the most unusual recommendation for the use of a stopbath comes from--

	 The Manual of Modern Photography by Hans Windisch; 1956 second edition; pg.s. 31 & 117. He say to use it AFTER the fixing bath as a way of removing
scum, lime deposits, silver deposits, and grease and/or fingerprints.

The formula I gave is double the amount of most in these books as I used it as a oneshot.
It did have an extra hardening affect and was lest odoriferous than Acetic Acid. I use it from the late 60's till I lost use of my first darkroom in
1977. Now I just take the cheap way out and use the acid.  
-- 
Just as a positive of a positive is a negative- A negative of a negative is a positive!

Many exposure meters are inaccurate when filters are used on the lens. It's
much safer to meter *without* the filter attached and then apply the filter
factor i.e. +3 stops for a red filter.  Since doing this I've had no
problems with exposure, but typically my Olympus cameras will underexpose
by up to two stops when metering with a red or orange filter attached.  You
can easily check this - look at the reading without the filter, then put
the filter on and see by how much the reading changes.  I imagine once
you've ascertained the error, if any, you could apply a correction to the
reading but I personally prefer to meter without the filter.

Regards
Richard

Hello everyone!
I have found an old ensign 6x9 cm camera - including a paryially exposed film.
Before experimenting, does anyone out there have any idea about developer 
and/or development time?
Would guess Rodinal 1+50 between 7-12  minutes @20C or PMK around 11-13 
minutes @ 21C is in the ballpark, but maybe someone knows better.

TIA.

Ooops.  Sorry.  Should have read the subject.

Selochrome was a medium speed film similar to Plus-X of its day.  At 50:1,
you should probably at the upper end of the range you suggested for rodinal,
and I would add another 20 percent at least because of the passage of time.
Perhaps 16 or 17 minutes.

Cheers,

John Rogers

..Mike,

How about a yellow filter? T-max film response is more like green filter
or a red filter? (or bin between)..

Thanks,

Hi, Brian ...

Every time I try to go to this "pgsys" web site it locks my computer up.
Could there be a typo in that URL?

You may want to check their web site (http://www.pgsys.com), they always
seem to have some sort of sale going on. Right now it's on barrel lenses...

Filter factors alone haven't given enough exposure for me with the red
filter, nor has reading through the meter alone. It's the combination of the
two, per the "View Camera" mgazine article, that has worked well.

Hi John!

Just out of the darkroom - this was funny!
I tried your suggested 17 minutes - with success!
There were 3  OK old frames plus 2 that I took when I got the camera. 2 
frames fogged, maybe someone had opened the camera sometimes.
The old frames look harder in contrast than the ones I took yesterday, all 
printable.

Do you have any idea about when this film was discontinued?

Best regards,
Jan O. Edman
Toulaud, France

Charles,
I'm the one who posted their web site address. I just checked after reading
your message, and it works. They seem to make a heavy use of Java scripts.
May be the reason of the problems with your computer set up...

   Fascinating!  The curious thing is that I have all these references
except I have the first edition of Harry Champlin's book and didn't know it
went to a second. For some reason I didn't think to look in "Facts and
Formulas".
  Harry Champlin, BTW, was a sort of West Coast photo guru and an intesting
character, who published mostly in "The Camera", a San Francisco magazine.
He published all sorts of super fine grain developer formulas in the mid to
late 1930's, mostly based on p-phenylenediamine. His most famous one,
Champlin 15, had a ton of ingredients plus Nickel ammonium sulfate. It was
blown out of the water in an article by Ed Lowe (SP?) of Edwal Labs. He
pointed out, amont other things. that the nickel compound was indissoluble
in the developer and precipitated as soon as added. So much for amateur
chemistry:-)
  The trick of using an acetic acid stop bath for removing calcium deposits
is fairly well known. It can be used on film which has dried. While the
film is still wet calcium and other deposits can usually be wiped off with
a cotton swab. Once the film has dried getting deposits off is much more
difficult. A acetic acid bath often will remove them. It must be acetic
acid and not something else.

Hi,

I do not know when the film was discontinued.  If I had to guess I would say
sometime in the  1960s, but that is just a guess.

I'm glad you were able to get printable images.  It is amazing how well film
holds well past the expiration date, isn't it.

Cheers,

John Rogers

  For future reference a good source for this sort of information is old
British Journal Annuals.  They have lots of advertising (to find out what
current product was) plus film development charts for whatever was current
at the time. 
  I believe Selochrome was Ilford's orthochromatic "box camera" film,
similar to Kodak Verichrome and Agfa/Ansco Plenachrome.
  It _is_ amazing how stable the latent images are in old film. Latent
image stability is evidently a more difficult quality to achieve in
emulsion making than making the un-exposed life long. One has both the
problem of fog build up and the problem of the charges which make up the
latent image recombining.

I did used Min. exposure for Max. Black method to check/deteremine
my printing exposure when I ran test and reported I need 18 minutes
for DiXactol/HP5+. ( Min. exposure for Max. Black first mentioned
in Mirror White's Zone System' manual, Philps Davis's beyond the
Zone System doesn't use it for reasons. Just to let you guys know that
I do familiar with these. My test should be 'accurate/right' enough)

So, If we are talking about VC papers, I already did what Mr. Edman
suggested. and I confirmed it by shooting a real image in my back yard
( distant is far enough, no bellow extension compensation needed. light
was constant during metering and exposure)

I understand Mr. Edman suggested I used graded 2 paper for getting an idea
what a properly exposed/developed negative should look alike. and it is a
good idea indeed. However, it will means that I can only print with graded
papers with this Zone VI enlarger. If Mr. Edman's suggestion is to let me
understand/realize what a properly exposed/developed negative should look
like, so I can be sure the problems I have is whether on negative or
enlarger, then actually the negative I developed for 18 minutes indeed has
very dense hightlight, by just looking at it, you know it is impossible to
print on garded 2 paper. I would say that even I am not an expert, I am
experienced enough to judge this. Also, if I use grade paper to establish
a properly exposed/developed negative that will print well on others
enlargers, it WON"T works with  my own very 'special' enlarger, isn't it?

[I am not try to 'defense'  myself, I appreciate so many helps. I just don't
know how to write English the right way...so I always write long to avoid
any misunderstanding as much as I can, and I do not intend to offense
anyone]

Let me explain why it takes so long to let me figure out what's going wrong:
(and hope someone might point out something I never thought about, and
actually my enlarger is OK - though based on Mr. McKay's EI reading on his
enlarger, it seems my enlarger obviously is ....)

When I start used PMK, while I was in Asia, at that time, I was using
Beseler VXL enlarger with its original cold light which was an Aristo W45
lamp, a lamp that best suited for graded papers. My negatives developed for
fitting that lamp look thin and flat just like Ansel, Adams and Gordon
Hutchings indicate in their books, negatives that look to be underdeveloped.
I have no problems at that time. So, yes, I do have ideas what the so call
'normal' taning negatives look like.

Later, when I prepared my portfolio for applying graduate schools to the USA
my cold light lamp broken, so I call Aristo and they suggested me using
their new, designed for VC papers, V54 lamp, so as I did. Well, suddenly I
need about one more grade of contrast for their rather green V54 lamp.
So, I thought: " WOW, color matters so much, the yellow stains by PMK, the
greener V54 lamp... sure they matter, that's how VC paper work...."
Soon, I got acceptence letters from schools, time to leave for USA. I gave
my enlarger to my students(I had two enlargers, Beseler MXT 4x5, VXL 810)
, and just brought my negatives and developing charts with me. I never had
chance to run new tests for N.  N+, N- for that Aristo V54 lamp, But I got
an idea that I need LONGER developing time if I was going to use that kind
greener V54 cold lamps when I arrived at USA

Came to USA is another story, I need to take English classes while I also
took formal photo classes, and deal with all the so call culture shucks...,
life is busy enough not to do testes. I bought a Zone VI enlarger based on
many figures they advertised. I found I need a long developing time, BUT
that was what happened when I just switch to use Aristo V54 lamp months ago.
Yet, according to the Book of Pyro, Gordon Hutchings does mentines a longer
developing time is need for V54 lamp to compensate PMK's yellow stain. So I
don't feel surprised and just adjust my developing time 'accordingly'. I
guess I would still felt nothing is wrong, but just Zone VI VC head is
'special' when use with taning developers if I did not start asking
Mr.Thornton how long DiXactol can go. It is this mailing list let me know
that my Zone VI head DIFFERS from others' Zone VI heads. That's the key
point I am frustrated now.

I should be happy that at school, for nowdays, tech is not that important
,all you need is issues-culture issues, sexual issues,... and then talk ( is
this our next thread ? art- technique vs issue ;-) Funny is that I am
considered the best printer at school(but not the best student because I
don't have issues). May be I should thank Calumet sent me a defect enlarger
that made me work hard spending hours, days for one print. Anyway, during
my school years here, I have not produced as many images as I did in my
country. I guess I will dump my enlarger instead of developing my negatives
fit my Zone VI enlarger. A 'normal' enlarger should be better(anyone wants
mine? I will let you know where I dump it) I guess getting another one
should be the answer as I don't see how this situation can be improved based
on Mr. Philippe's experience with Calumet one year ago.(yes, I am a long
time Calumet customer, May be 8 years since I first mail order from them in
Asia)

PS: A short story: I heard Mr. Philippe's story on newsgroup, and one day,
when I visited a show in Ohio, I met a lady who was thinking to buy a Zone
VI enlarger. I told her I have one but also mentined Mr. Philippe's opinion.
So she call Calumet and email me that, according to that lady, Calumet
claimed that was one person who try to destory calumet reputation... nothing
wrong with Zone VI enlarger, they sold many but never heard there is another
one complain(which also made me never thought if there is problem with my
enlarger). I lost that lady's email when my PC crashed, I don't know if she
bought one or not, but it seems that Calumet quite possibly won't deal with
me if I claimed I have problem with my enlarger....

I would like to thank all the efforts so many people provided to me. At this
point, my conclusion is that the problem is on the VC head. I will follow
Mr. Edman's suggestion printing one grade 2 paper(though I know what I
will get) since I need to produce some H&D curves for sending to Calumet
But, I guess I will get a Durst first since I locate four of them during
this weekend. That might makes thing easier and I can be sure I have a
normal enlarger, I guess even I need to move from basement to garage
(very cold in winter), it still  worth of doing so. I have no interest ,
according to Mr. Philippe, waiting for four months to see if things got
fixed and unable to use a enlarger in that period .

Actually, my 'guess' is, for what I understand from Aristo cold lamp, that
the heater inside Zone VI head need some adjustment, That's it, done!
But, unlike Aristo, Calumet's Zone VI manual against customer open the VC
head. I also speak to Aristo to see if they can help, but they said I should
send it to Calumet. They(Aristo) won't do it

With little hope that my enlarger is OK, but my developing tech is
questionable/wrong. It is my conclusion getting another enlarger is the
better choice. I hate choosing so, allow me to mention that, for protecting
US citizens, I am not allowed to work in the US, school is expensive,
Photograhy is expensive, life is hard that I can only spend money I
brought from my country, every cent counts. I wish my enlarger is OK,
really. But I don't think so.

Thanks again for all the helps. and sorry for the long writing. I just try
to give details so we don't need to guess around

Still, any insight is welcomed

By the way, is there any 8x10 enlarger is shorter than 7 feet ?


With much appreciation

I remember using Ilford Selochrome *Pan* in my first camera, an Ilford
Sporti 4 (remember those?!) in the sixties.  If this is distinct from plain
"Selochrome" then that would suggest the latter was an ortho film I guess.
I also remember Kodak "Verichrome Pan" from the same era.  A long time
before I got to developing my own, mind you :-)

I understand that many of these "send this to everybody in you address book"
warnings are hoaxes, and I haven't done that - but how does one know?!
To be safe and warn my friends on this list I have posted it just here for
what it is worth. Please use your discretion about sending it on, but be
alert - just in case

I trust this is a reasonable precaution to have taken? My apologies in
advance if I have unnecessarily added to the volume of mail on the list. It
purports to come from IBM - again for what that is worth.

If you are using TMax films you run into the problems of 'extended red
sensitivity', which The Yellow Peril explains as a way of making the film
act as if there were a light yellow filter on the lens. This has the nice
effect of dumping our shadow detail in the higher altitudes. The blue light
in the shadows is lost on the negative when using a red filter unless one
really downrates the film or adds extra exposure in compensation. If you try
TMax after the normal films you get a rude awakening when you process the
film and discover you have no shadow detail to work with. If you use it, run
some tests first, being aware that at different times of day the light
changes so the shadow detail will also.

Richard is probably right.  The only reference I have to Selochrome other
than in a 1940s book in which it is referred to as a medium speed film with
an ASA of about 64 is from the web in what I assume is Swdish, in a brief
history of rollfilm, with an implied comparison to Verichrome.

"Kodak kom med sin Verichromefilm 1931. Den var helt ortokromatisk och
dubbelskiktad fr att ge en stor exponeringslatitud. Ilford svarade med sin
Selochrome samma r. En av de frsta hgklassiga smbildsfilmerna, Kodaks
Panatomic, tillika pankromatisk, kom 1933."

I'm guessing a rough translation goes something like this:

Kodak came out with its Verichrome film in 1931.  It was a fast othocromatic
(with double emulsion for extented latitude.?) Ilford followed with its
Selochrome in the same year.  Then we have the first (fine grain?) 35mm
(miniature picture) film, Kodak's Panatomic, a panchromatic film, that came
in 1933.

I remember using Ilford Selochrome *Pan* in my first camera, an Ilford
Sporti 4 (remember those?!) in the sixties.  If this is distinct from plain
"Selochrome" then that would suggest the latter was an ortho film I guess.
I also remember Kodak "Verichrome Pan" from the same era.  A long time
before I got to developing my own, mind you :-)

An easy way to tell a hoax: All real warnings should say 
"for details refer to ...."  and should give a URL,
with the address e.g. www.ibm.com/....   or www.aol.com/...
etc. where the details are given.  
  Anything that only gives a name/telephone number and

Previous thread snipped...

  I rechecked my 1942 edition of _Ilford Manual of Photography_ and found
Selochrome, which I somehow missed the first time. Selochrome was available
in plate, sheet, and roll sizes. It is described as a "highly
orthochromatic film". Highly orthochromatic probably means its green
sensitivity extends well into the yellow but not to red. 
  At the same time Ilford made several roll films with the name Selo. These
were panchromatic films. Selo F.P. for Fine grain Pan; Selo H.P. for High
speed Pan film. The FP and HP part are still with us. There was also a Selo
Ortho. This was a slower film than Selochrome, evidently an older film. The
description suggests its color sensitivity did not extend as far into the
green as Selochrome. This is confirmed by the filter factors which are
higher for Selo Ortho than for Selochrome. 
  The translation is accurate insofar as Verichrome was a double coated
film, as were and are many films. The idea is to combine a relatively low
and relatively high contrast emulsion of different speeds to get an
extended H&D curve. More modern emulsions combine the two types in one
allowing thinner coatings.
  Verichrome was replaced with Verichrome Pan about 1958. Evidently Ilford
did the same thing around the same time. V-Pan is double coated and is
excellent stuff.
  Ortho film has the advantage of being less vulnerable to fogging by a red
counting window in a box camera and easy development by inspection using a
deep red safelight. 
  Press photographers used a lot of ortho film both for the ability to
develop by inspection and for the somewhat better definition of faces when
used with flash bulbs on the camera. 
  AFAIK, the last pictorial ortho film was Tri-X Ortho, discontinued about
ten years ago. (I still have some in the freezer).

I'm reasonably familiar with Swedish - the above isn't all that bad, but
here's my translation

Kodak came out with its Verichrome film in 1931. It was entirely
ortochromatic and with a double emulsion for extended exposure latitude.
Ilford answered with its Selochrome in the same year. One of the first
high class miniature films, Kodak Panatomic, which was panchromatic, came
in 1933.

Don't Agfa still make an ortho film?  They certainly listed one a year or
two back.

Hi there.
Have bitten the bullet and had a go at unsharp masking. Have not yet
hit the mark though.
Perhaps a silly question, but how unsharp is the mask supposed to be?
I'm testing it on an image of textured rock. Should the texture be
lightly diffused (and therefore entirely recognisable), or heavily
diffused to the point of only being recognisable in terms of general
shapes in the mask?
Any ideas would be appreciated?
Scott.
PS Is there any reason why I should not use Kodalith Ortho film?
(...as I happen to have some).

Hi,

Some time ago I found a nice site with full description on unsharp
masking; cannot find it now, I do remeber that the adress was incredably
long..

I did find a another that might be of interest:

http://www.radekaphotography.com/

Good luck,

The Second edition was published with the "new" Champlin 16 formula.

  > It was blown out of the water in an article by Ed Lowe (SP?) of Edwal Labs.

That's interesting. Because in his book "What You Should Know About Developers",
Dr. Lowe had praised it as being one of the under appreciated but over hype developers
of it day. I wonder what happen to change his mind? I've always wanted to try #15 every
since reading about it. But then, I simple add up the cost of the chemicals( especially
the Nickel ammonium sulfate) and I don't think it will happen.
	Do you have Harry's other book- "Brilliance, Tone, and Gradation"? It has soon
good (dated but good) advice as well as formulas.

The website was very intresting about using masks to
correct problems due to S-curve density curves and
contrast control. There is a section on masks in
Cteins book Post Exposure, mostly related to colour
printing. On this subject of film density curve shapes
I have found the following web site of interest, to be
honest I do not have suffient practical experience to
know of the desirability of s-curce against linear.
Here is the web, go to the bottom of the page:

The image doesn't need to be, and perhaps shouldn't be, greatly diffused.
Howard Bond, who wrote several articles about unsharp masking, no longer
uses any diffusion sheet between the negative and the masking film so
obviously he's not getting a very diffused image.

If you're having problems, one possibility is that your masks are too dense.
It doesn't seem logical perhaps but you want a very, very thin mask, one
which, if it were a negative, you would think was much too thin to print.

I wouldn't use lith film for unsharp masking though I've never tried it and
perhaps it would work. However, it's a high contrast film and, while an
unsharp mask is thin, it normally does have more or less continuous tones in
the midtones and highlights.   I use T Max 100 just because that's what I
learned with.

Almost all masks will give the added edge effect ....if all else is properly
exposed and developed a regular mask is fine if a little correction is in
hand use one of the masks that McNutt describes. Not to throw too much in
here but there are many more types of masks that can be used including color
tinted for local contrast control with multigrade papers and burn and dodge
masks that can save trouble in printing editions. Once the basic setup is
mastered you have unlimited possibilities to work with ....Auto positive or
reversal masks ....additional image masks { maybe clouds etc. } .. I've been
at this since the late '70's and have new ideas each time I print with
masks.....still a _pain_ though..... but sometimes rewarding!

Mr Cheng.

Would you please contact me direct. I can put you in touch with a photographer and printer in the states who should be able to help with your Zone VI Enlarger problem.

That's what I think. I recall about one year ago, there was one person
posted on usernet that he has problem with Zone VI VC head( he claimed
he never be able to get over 3 1/2 even he use blue lamp only). I never
thought it will happen to me....,

I had just printed the step tablet that was developed 18 minutes by exposing
it blue lamp only, and I got 11 steps between pure black and pure white. 2
steps are 1 stop/1 EV, so there are 5 f-stops tonal range rendered EVEN it
was exposed by Blue lamp only. I think it confirms the VC head I have has
something wrong....

Yes, I did check temperture. I use 3 in JOBO (one come with JOBO
I put two more), one at end, one near motor. The differences between
them within 0.5"C. Room temperature is 22"C.

I am going to send that Zone VI VC head back to Calumet. I always
thought it was PMK's stain makes me need long dev. time. But now
I think the answer is there.

I have no regret went through these troubles, I am very interested in
the different results between tray and JOBO development. I think I will
continue working on the JOBO/Dixactol by using different dilution;
sheet/volume ratio to see what it can do for extreme N- development (because
lower contrast yet getting higher EI than tray development, I think this
will still holds true even I had my Zone VI fixed). I will report more if I
do find something worth of mention to you.

Thank you very much for try to help me out. much appreciated!

PS: I had used the post-flash method (expose paper by dim light
when paper was developed half way in developer) that you mention
in your book. It is very useful. (I haven't use it for a while since I got
the Zone VI enlarger when I came to the US), I like its effect better than
flash papers under enlarger.

Again, thank for all the helps, Mr. Thornton and Mr. McLean.

With all the best,
C.J. Cheng

 Note the qualifier "pictorial". The Agfa film (Agfa Ortho) is a high
contrast film intended for copying and other special uses. It can be
developed for low contrast. There is a data sheet for this stuff on the
Agfa web site.
 There are other special purpose ortho and non-color-sensitized films,
mainly for copying or line work.
  Up till the 1970's there were a number of ortho roll and sheet films
available. They were popular for "character" portraits since the lack of
red sensitivity exagerates skin textures. You can get a similar effect on
pan film with a cyan filter. Like so many other products ortho film went
away simply because it fell out of use. 
 Most photographic materials are made by mass production techniques which
are not economical for small production. So, if sales fall below some
threshold, the product is discontinued. When Kodak, or anyone else,
discontinues a product its because it is no longer profitable, usually due
to low sales.

  I do have the other book. I may be wrong about Dr. Lowe, in which case I
can't remember who wrote the article. Someone with enough prestige to make
it stick.   Much of the general advice given in both books is accurate and
valuable.

Thanks everyone for the advice/contacts.
With referance to the below...
It has prompted another question about how the mask is supposed to
look.
How far is the positive mask, (despite being "very very thin", and not
"too" diffuse) supposed to extend into the midtones?
What are the implications of using either continuous tone or lith for
a mask?
Scott.
PS. I wish i could see somebodys successful negative, mask, and
sandwhich, I would know exactly what i was aiming for then. Any sites
that may have such illustrations?

If you were to purchase a step wedge and compare by eye the tones in your
mask to the tones that are needed by using the step wedge you could get
extremely close. My masks run from .15 for contrast control to .90 for
severe local burning and dodging. Unsharp mask will work from about . 20 to
. 45 and maybe a bit more at times. The step wedge will be divided into pre
determined densities depending on which one you find.
Don't spend much on this as even the simplest ones work well.
Maybe this might help!

In what terms would you like a response when you ask "how far should the
mask extend into the midtones?" There is no single, perfect, standard for
the density of an unsharp mask and in actual practice the precise density
isn't critical. However, if you have a densitometer and would like numbers,
a maximum density anywhere from .20 to .40 will usually work fine.

As I said before, I don't think lith film is very suitable for an unsharp
mask because of its high contrast. While someone may say they've used it and
it works fine, in which case I would stand corrected, unless someone with
actual experience says it's fine, I would stay away from it. Use T Max 100
or any other similar continuous tone film.

After all this discussion about 8X10 enlargers, I have a Bessler head for
sale not 2 hours on it; and new design; at risk of spamming... there's a
mint restored Ansco Agfa Korona, with two virgin lensboards available, also.

Contact me off list if you're seriously interested.  Fair prices considered,
definate value firmly in mind.  Historic value sentimental, only; but this
has a great ownership history, too.

I recommended that Scott use Ilford's ortho film precisely because it is not
high contrast (they do do a different high contrast copying film). It is
fully continuous tone and very easy to handle and control with development
by inspection. Much better than camera film IMHO for the occasional user,
and maybe for the full time user as well.

The image doesn't need to be, and perhaps shouldn't be, greatly diffused.
Howard Bond, who wrote several articles about unsharp masking, no longer
uses any diffusion sheet between the negative and the masking film so
obviously he's not getting a very diffused image.

If you're having problems, one possibility is that your masks are too dense.
It doesn't seem logical perhaps but you want a very, very thin mask, one
which, if it were a negative, you would think was much too thin to print.

I wouldn't use lith film for unsharp masking though I've never tried it and
perhaps it would work. However, it's a high contrast film and, while an
unsharp mask is thin, it normally does have more or less continuous tones in
the midtones and highlights.   I use T Max 100 just because that's what I
learned with.

Thanks everyone for the advice/contacts.
With referance to the below...
It has prompted another question about how the mask is supposed to
look.
How far is the positive mask, (despite being "very very thin", and not
"too" diffuse) supposed to extend into the midtones?
What are the implications of using either continuous tone or lith for
a mask?
Scott.
PS. I wish i could see somebodys successful negative, mask, and
sandwhich, I would know exactly what i was aiming for then. Any sites
that may have such illustrations?

Scott
Another plug for my forthcoming book due October - there's just such an

 To save me trouble with the wrong film .....what film exactly { name or
number.....whatever they call it } is the Ilford film you refer to. I can't
find the original post! I used to use ortho emulsions {30+ years ago } when
shooting non sky images on 8x10. Great stuff! .....just am not aware of the
type you mention and would really like to give it a try.  Is it for graphic
arts or is it still used for regular camera shooting?
I would enjoy having it for shooting many scenes that have rocks and other
non blue related subjects in them. Sounds like a winner with masking also!
In the US all of the ortho films are usually the extreme high contrast type
now. Even they can be used for continuos tone shooting with weak continuos
tone developers and I've tried it in extremely flat fog type scenes with
success. Looks like under exposed and over developed TriX. { n+3 or 4 }

I've really enjoyed this thread on masking.  At the time Howard Bond
published the first article (that I had seen) on the subject, I had
already started working with PMK (after a very long search for the "holy
grail" to get the highlights I wanted on paper) and was - and remain -
very happy with the results and consistency.  

This thread, however, is very timely.  My friend was hired to print a set
of 20x24 exhibition prints from 4x5 negatives.  Though the photographer
has a good docier, her negatives, made on type 55 p/n were simply not
printable in a normal fashion.  They were made in an abandoned factory
interior with no artificial illumination on a bright sunny day.  The sun
was shining through the windows right in the middle of the image.  She
underexposed the shadows by about 1 1/2 stops and the brilliance in the
windows was probably between zones 12 and 13 - so compacted as to be
totally unseparable.  

My buddy went through 40 sheets of MGIV FB paper with horrible results
(though actually, they were "best possible" prints from the negatives).  I
suggested we try making a test mask.  After a bit of fumble-futzing, he
made about a zone 5 mask (this was real crude just to see if the technique
could work to salvage the negative).  I was amazed when I printed the
sandwich to see how effective the technique could be.  We were able to get
a zone 8 1/2 in those windows!  I can see where, with a zone 3 equivalent
mask (where the densest portions of the positive mask were equal to zone 3
in density) we could make a very acceptable print.  

This morning when my friend
contacted his customer, she got ticked off at him for him telling her the
negatives needed masking and terminated him immediately, so we'll never
bring these images to perfection.  But at least we tried and were
sufficiently successful to see the possibilities of the mask.  I still
love my PMK and produce phenomenal negatives, and, despite Howard's recent
comments that he prefers masking to pyro, I'm sticking with PMK for my
personal work.  But for clients, masking can salvage some pretty awful
stuff.

I've got one question: since this was done on an emergency basis, we
didn't have the benefit of a device to do the pin registering and did the
registration by eye on a light box and taped the edges of the sandwich
together.  Of course the registration was lousy - but sufficiently good to
see that the technique would work.  Is there a reasonable alternative to
the $300 machine Howard recommends to effect proper registration?

TIA,
Curt

I've given a lot of thought to zone system nomenclature over the past
couple of days.  I stayed awake several hours one night last week after
reading Les's discussion in which he indicated placement of shadows on
Zone VI.  I was nagged at how with 35+ years of serious photographic
experience I could have been placing my important shadow detail on from
zones 3 1/2 to 4.  I literally could't sleep.  

My buddy, and fellow photographer, Peter was staying with me.  Peter is
from central England and knows Les and his work and holds them in the
highest regard.

Together, we couldn't ponder through it and just decided it was a simple
reversal.  I'm dyslexic, which doesn't help.  I'm capable of making the
same reversal.  The little sticker on my spotmeter causes me the
same grief.  The upshot is, I've decided to use alphanumerics for any
written discussion on the zone system, either here on the newslist or with
my students because maybe others have the same problem.

I'm not trying to be arrogant or "generation X"-type cute about it, but
pragmatic.  Now that we're frequently dicussing negatives with highlights
up to zone XIII, I'm getting confused with zone VIII.  Saying "zone 13"
works much better for me.  Is this too much of a sacrilege?  What do
others think?

Curt

I find no problem with it or with doing both[e.g. zone 13 (XIII)].
anything for more clarity.

Depending on your enlarger negative area and how the negs have to be mounted
there are several ways to do this. The simple pins used for graphic arts
registration are great if you have the room for them in your enlarger. If
you don't like to work directly on the neg you can strip it into a larger
acetate sheet and pin punch the acetate along with the mask. There is a
special tape for this from Kodak that is dimensionally stable .Actually
works as well as my $1000 in reg. device and matching film holder!!  For 4x5
and smaller you can adapt the Wess middle size punch { under $75.US  I
think } to work. I have seen great results done by folks using this
approach. I'm not sure what Howard uses so won't comment on it but there are
many inexpensive ways to use 4x5 ....Wess included . I  use Wess products
exclusively for the formats 4x5 and smaller. { 1-800-itswess in the US}
don't believe they have a URL. The Wess system uses a plastic neg mount
 very cheap....like slide mounts that have the pins already in them and a
simple punch to use for the film. You can leave the film and mask together
for storage. You use the slide mount to expose the masks and do all
registration.....Great inexpensive system! I use it for all sizes up to 4x5
and only use a custom pin system for larger formats. You can send the
clients slides or negs back to them in the mount or separately. Wess has a
good Catalog with many inexpensive products and have been very responsive to
my needs! There are examples of slide masking and the results in it.

Hi Chuck
It doesn't seem to have a product code number on the pack. It's known simply
as 'Ilford Technical Film - Ortho' and it is described as 'Wide contrast
latitude orthochromatic film. Polyester base. Interleaved.' The base is
7/1000 inch thick and it uses a dark red safelight - note: NOT orange as I
can report from painful experience. Its speed seems to be about EI 5 at a
guess. I don't know for sure - I just do a test strip like paper and develop
in whatever print developer I am using and pull when it looks about right.
Occasionally, I double dilute the print developer for better control. It can
be used in camera, and I have used it successfully for portraits with
electronic flash, and for still lifes with natural north facing window
light.
I used print developer by inspection for these too. It really is very
tolerant and easy to use, but I wouldn't like to rely on its colour response
for, say, colour transparency masking without tests.
There is another Ilford Technical Film called 'Line' which is described as
'Blue sensitive high contrast film. Polyester base. Interleaved'. It is
7/1000 inch too, but requires a dark brown safelight. This behaves like the
traditional lith films, and though you develop by inspection, you'd be hard
pressed to get anything like a continuous tone from it under any
circumstances.
I have used the Ilford Ortho film for all sorts of print copying and
duplicate negatives etc. certainly back to the 1970s when I used to buy it
in 6x9 before I started buying it in my current 5x4 which I cut down for use
in the darkroom for medium format masking. I simply always have a box in the
darkroom fridge. For a quick and dirty copy print I put the print on the
enlarger baseboard, having focussed a scrap negative in the enlarger to
cover the print's area. I then substitute the scrap negative with a sheet of
the Ortho film in the negative carrier emulsion down. I fire a small
electronic flash gun at about 30 to the print from equal distance from each
of the four sides and develop the Ortho film in print developer by
inspection. It's very easy to adjust exposure (more or fewer flashes/open up
or stop down) and development this way to get a negative that  prints well.

 To save me trouble with the wrong film .....what film exactly { name or
number.....whatever they call it } is the Ilford film you refer to. I can't
find the original post! I used to use ortho emulsions {30+ years ago } when
shooting non sky images on 8x10. Great stuff! .....just am not aware of the
type you mention and would really like to give it a try.  Is it for graphic
arts or is it still used for regular camera shooting?
I would enjoy having it for shooting many scenes that have rocks and other
non blue related subjects in them. Sounds like a winner with masking also!
In the US all of the ortho films are usually the extreme high contrast type
now. Even they can be used for continuos tone shooting with weak continuos
tone developers and I've tried it in extremely flat fog type scenes with
success. Looks like under exposed and over developed TriX. { n+3 or 4 }

Barry,
I have ordered the film you recommend, and look forward to trying it.
A little list of questions!
I noticed that you say you do not use unsharp masking often yourself.
You have written that you are passionate about sharpness.
Why then do you not use unsharp masking more?
Is it a question of time? Or are there "other things" I have yet to
discover?
And with reference to DiXactol, if a chosen negative is to be
subjected to unsharp masking, is the stain a consideration?(help or
hindrance?) or an irrelevance?
Hope you don't mind the questions
Scott

I've had a life long battle with shadow detail and it's placement. One
thought I have is that modern thin emulsion films are not able to record
data at nearly the designated speed that is given. This goes unnoticed for
the large part unless like me you have subjects that need very detailed
"shadows". I have found that like some others you need to place the
perceived shadow areas on zone 4 { IV } at least to make images that print
well. If you are shooting a predominately a middle to high value scene it
might not matter as much. In this case the shadow detail is not as important
to the image and often it is fine at a lower exposure and normal
development. For the "dark forest with needed shadow detail" you will have
to give a little more support than old Ansel recommends with the films that
are currently sold. { hp5+ through Tmax types} .This often means less
development which agrees with so many folks use of developers such as
DiXactol or the staining pyro types.{ highlight protection} I had a chance
last week to see some negs shot and developed from the Bergger 200 film and
although I didn't get to read them on a densitometer I think by visual
inspection that the shadow detail was better at lower exposures than  with
the more modern films. This emulsion would probably correspond with Ansel's
film types of the time the zone system placements were determined. I'm not
in any way saying that the Bergger films are better just that their curves
allow for lower placement and still allow for good detail.  I hope all know
that the zone system is correct for only a perfect/average sloped  film.
Each film and developer combo will have its own characteristics and should
be explored to find what's best. Recently I was able to start testing
several films { until a huge amount of work hit me } and developers and
thought that I would try several papers at the same time. I guess that I
have been lazy for the last years and had stuck to old favorites....since
almost all except poly/multi contrast are being discontinued I wanted to
check the response of the poly/multi at grade two with both the filters and
the "white" light of my enlargers. Let us just say that the variety of
prints from a contact printed 8x10 neg were all over the place! Plus or
minus 1 grade at least. The contact paper { AZO } was not even close to the
older graded papers and almost 2 grades higher contrast than a white light
print made from two different enlargers on Ilford MGIV.  I use several
enlargers with different light sources and there was absolutely no agreement
with each of the results when they were interchanged. I have the same color
head on two of them and they didn't match well either! ...same lens was used
to make the exposures even though they were contact printed.  I notice many
heated discussions about exposure and development and would like to put in
my more than two cents worth that I would bet that many disagreements would
be over paper/ light head / personal taste matters and not actual darkroom
"TRUTH'S". Almost every "good" printer I know follows the advice that Barry
T gives on his website that most of the negs he sees from average
photographers are underexposed and overdeveloped. The consistency of this
failure is what I think is important. If everyone seems to have the same
problem I think that however you define it the shadows need more exposure
than what St Ansel noted years ago.  You can fight out favorite developers
and how long in each of them but the shadows need more support which comes
only from more exposure. Well maybe if I ever get that trip to Italy with
its blistering white sun and white textured buildings I'll change my
technique a bit but that's another story................
My money's worth

Chuck, You'll  find it list as ortho +,  i use it in both 4x5 and 8x10 for
making positives  with platinum printing.  I have been using it for years.  I
had been ordering it from Unique Photo in New Jersey.  I believe that they also
had it in rolls of 40" x 100', but that was back in the early 90's.

Did you added hydroquinone when the 2 other chemicals are completely 
dissolved? If it is not the case try to add first the metol in 0.75l of 40
to 50 C of distillate  water and stir until it is fully dissolved then add
the sulphite and again stir until complete dissolution and finally add the
hydroquinone to the clear solution and see if the same thing happens. Please
let me know. If you still have problem some thing should be wrong with the
chemicals. metol should white or slightly grey, sulphite should white and
dust power if it is anhydrous, and hydroquinone should be white or slightly
yellow or beige.

What if you don't use the designated speed that is given?  Would you then
be able to get the shadow detail you want in Zone III?  I have calibrated
all my cameras, and each has a different speed with Tri X:  the Minolta has
to be shot at 600, the Mamiya Sekor at 400, the Lubitel at 16000!

Yes and no! :o)
 The problem is not exactly that the meter is not registering right but that
the exposures when made are not linear in their response. I'm not the math
person to be writing this so sorry for the poor explanation....but here
goes:
  The distance from one "zone" to the next is not always one doubling or
halving of the previous zone. That is to say that in this case the film
responds well from zone 4 { IV } to zone 7 or 8. When you make your
exposures and check them by printing or on a densitometer the distance
between each is about the perfect doubling or halving of the previous zone.
Now the trouble begins...The lower zones are not always in agreement with
the "zone" system. They seem { to me } to be different than one stop in the
low zones and high zones. This is the reason we see a "S" shape to the given
film curves when we read the manufactures data sheets. Supposedly the
section of the film curve that we use is along the straight part of the film
"curve". My supposition is that we are lower on the curve than the data
reports. That means that we have a flattening of the differences between the
zones and by raising the exposure a small bit over what is recommended we
move the exposed film curve into the straighter part of the "film curve".
This results in better separation of the tones from one another. For me this
allows the shadow detail to be fully pronounced and allow for the
differences of say a fir tree in shadow from a deciduous tree. I try to
shoot this type of scene in the spring {where I live} to give better
separation to these trees as the deciduous tree will be more yellow or at
least not as deep green in the spring as the darker Spruce or fir tree. This
is what I mean by separation and it needs to be fully realized in the type
of images that I enjoy shooting. If the film is not fully responding to the
tone differences at this low exposure level then the different types of
trees and also the dark forest floor leaves are too close in tone to each
other and you loose that sparkle that is needed for "fine" prints. The real
proof of this is in shooting color film which records these tones the same
but has different colors that allow the eye to see the differences of the
parts of the subject and when printed will give a much better visual
"separation"  to the objects in the image. I'm just not going to settle for
this even though I'm still making part of my living doing color nature work.
:o) ...I want to have the same ability to have folks see the different tones
that lie along this part of the film curve as fully "separated" as possible.
One can just expose more to do this but then the highlights will move toward
blocking up which is also thought of as having that part of the film flatten
out in the tonal differences between say the medium white of clouds and the
bright whispy whites that make clouds "glow"! Barry;s DiXactol and the other
pyro types of developers help to stop the highlights from blocking up but if
the film is exposed to far up the film curve then you will have to shorten
the development to prevent this. >>>>here we go again in the same
dance......shortening the development lowers the "internal contrast" that is
so needed for proper shadow separation.....Whew!!!!!!!
 So for the short answer yes you can just use the meter reading that works
for your camera....you are way ahead of most others if you have this worked
out well but you will loose a bit on the highlight end. In many of the
recent threads about exposing on different zones you might have detected
that many think that the better way to treat the film is to do just this. I
so rarely get to work with light toned subjects except snow that I'm the
wrong person to be spouting off here. Blocked up or flat highlights are just
as degrading to a fine print as shadow detail loss. This is why there is
always so much subjectivity in the post of all of the folks that go to so
much trouble to find the answers. Some shoot in forest some in the high
desert. some favor city scenes that have the white painted buildings and
still brighter skies with still brighter clouds while dense forest and deep
lightless gorge nuts like me are trying to work with the black cat in the
coal bin subjects. I'll quit before I confuse myself. :o)
Good Light ,
Chuck

Curt,

Sorry that my slip on the keyboard cost you some sleep. I hope you read my posting the following night when I corrected the error to Zone 4. Do you ever come across to the UK? If so let me know when you are next going to be here and perhaps we can meet up. If you want to talk direct please get in touch  my email address is lesmcl@scotborders.co.uk

Subject:  Zone system nomenclature

	
I've given a lot of thought to zone system nomenclature over the past
couple of days.  I stayed awake several hours one night last week after
reading Les's discussion in which he indicated placement of shadows on
Zone VI.  I was nagged at how with 35+ years of serious photographic
experience I could have been placing my important shadow detail on from
zones 3 1/2 to 4.  I literally could't sleep.  

My buddy, and fellow photographer, Peter was staying with me.  Peter is
from central England and knows Les and his work and holds them in the
highest regard.

Together, we couldn't ponder through it and just decided it was a simple
reversal.  I'm dyslexic, which doesn't help.  I'm capable of making the
same reversal.  The little sticker on my spotmeter causes me the
same grief.  The upshot is, I've decided to use alphanumerics for any
written discussion on the zone system, either here on the newslist or with
my students because maybe others have the same problem.

I'm not trying to be arrogant or "generation X"-type cute about it, but
pragmatic.  Now that we're frequently dicussing negatives with highlights
up to zone XIII, I'm getting confused with zone VIII.  Saying "zone 13"
works much better for me.  Is this too much of a sacrilege?  What do
others think?

Regards,
Curt

Thanks for the reply! I'll be thinning out my wallet as soon as
possible......seems that subscribing to this list has put a serious dent in
my budget ! Every week or so there is something that I just have to have!
:o) I've been at this since the sixties so you would think that there is an
end somewhere. Maybe I should have tried another addiction.....photography
seems to be an ever deepening morass. Whew ...glad I've not gotten mixed up
with the platinum crowd yet!  ......But now that you mention
it..............

One other point of curiosity I've always had. I develop pretty much everything
in PMK Pyro which already keeps the highlights under control and gives me very
nice edge effects.  Will masking materially improve this or is doing this with
a Pyro neg a case of "belt AND suspenders"?

How would this film work for making 8x10 contact B&W negatives from color
transparencies?

I feel that it is film format dependent. The larger the format the better
chance you have of just adding suspenders to your belt. If you are happy
with your sharpness I would run like hell away from masking! It can cure all
types of ills but is still a pain! kind of like plowing the garden should
take care of the weeds all summer and the pain to get on your knees to keep
it up. It does change other tones in the print no matter how good you are so
take that into consideration. I print a lot of color where I feel that
masking is almost always necessary so doing it for B&W is just an easier way
to achieve some results for me. I think that masking has a look all of its
own also....not the same at all as the regular B&W print. If you then expose
and develop for masking much as the color film demands you can achieve a
different look. sometimes with dark subjects it can add a bit of snap to the
image . Most of the work I see masked is overboard! Way overboard! The more
you do it the more you notice it in others work! This should not happen in
my subjective opinion but does even with the folks that write all of the
photo articles. The distance your prints will be viewed from matters also.
If you hate dust and glass carriers run!

I'm new to this list, so I hope that this topic isn't too much of an old
chestnut (as we English would say). 

I'm interested in stepping up from medium format to 5x4 inch. Finding a well
built camera [example: Arca Swiss; Linhof] doesn't seem to be a problem, but
finding one that gives me an image I can easily visualise is more
problematic... 

In comparison, I've used Hassleblad equipment for years. The Acute Matte
screen makes a huge difference to its performance compared to a conventional
screen (I have both). One might think that this type of technology would be
de rigueur for large format, but this would not seem to be the case.

SUMMARY:-

*	The intensity of the screen image for focusing and visualisation
seems (to me) a fundamental limitation of large format photography.
*	Both manufacturers and product reviewers seem (in my view) to
concentrate on range of camera movements rather than much consideration of
image visualisation. The problem I have found is that if you apply movements
in field use then you cannot see the consequences, which rather defeats the
object...
*	There are a range of products described as being improved screens
for visualisation:-
*	Beattie Intenscreen
*	Bosscreen
*	Brightscreen
	- but I have never yet seen these reviewed or compared. I have no
idea how much they contribute to improving image intensity. 
*	From previous web discussion I've seen, the Bosscreen is Dutch,
available in the U.S. and is well thought of, but not available in the UK as
far as I can tell. I know very little else about this product.
*	Are there some practical hints, suggestions, articles on focusing
screen intensity and the available products (screens; reflex viewers; etc)
or are there any camera systems that perform better than others in this
aspect? 
*	Of course, I am aware that there are a range of limitations with
5"x4" (Maximum lens aperture, Laws of physics, Lens design for maximum image
circle, etc...)

BACKGROUND

I recently tried out a Linhof Technikardan 45S with a 90mm Super Angulon;
mainly for field use. 

I liked the quality of build of the camera a lot, but found that, although
it came with what was supposed to be a Beattie screen, it was very difficult
to actually see the image away from a centre "hot-spot," especially when
focusing at distance.

This was using the camera in combination with a reflex viewer, by the way,
as I like to see the image the right way up!

>From my point of view, therefore, the darkness of the image is a limiting
factor in whether to go over to large format, or not. Basically, I like to
be able to see every last detail of a shot before I take it, fading eyesight
not withstanding..


Any observations or suggestions?

Cheers

Ian Watkins

  The ISO speed is the result of a measurement at a specified contrast and
range of density. If the contrast is changed the speed is no longer valid.
If the developer is changed the speed may also be changed. Up to the last
revision a standard developer was specified, the last revision dropped that
and allows the use of any developer provided it is specified in the results.
 The speed is really only a guide and a number to plug into an exposure
meter for "average" use. 
  Because of the way the ISO system measures speed there is not much margin
on the low exposure side. If you use an exposure meter shadow detail will
depend on where the meter centers the exposure with relation to the film
curve. By using a lower speed than the published speed you move the entire
exposure up the curve. The effective result is that there is more shadow
detail and all densities are higher. 
  When rated by the ISO method most film has no more than about one or two
stops latitude on the shadow side but as much as ten or twelve stops on the
highlight side. So, there is little or no problem with increasing exposure,
especially if you know you want more shadow detail than the ISO rating
gives you. 
  The Zone System is an elaboration of the simple relationship between
exposure, deevlopment, contrast, and density which affects all films. The
Zone System method of determining _effective_ speed takes into account the
desired contrast and density range of the negative in relationship to the
brightness range of the subject. It also takes into account inaccuracies in
shutter and stop calibration, and even flare in the lens and camera.
 The idea is that one wants to record the brightness range of the subject
in such a way that it will be reproducable on printing paper of reasonable
contrast. 
  It is important to understand the effect of film H&D curve on the tonal
reproduction of the scene. All films have a section at the low exposure
side called the "toe". It has a lower contrast than the rest of the curve.
Some films have a very short "toe" section, some are medium, and a few have
very long toes. T-Max films and the old Double-X have rather short toes,
most other B&W films have medium toes, Plus-X and Tri-X _sheet_ film have
very long toes. In fact, Plus-X sheet film is nearly all toe since the
contrast rises steadily with density throughout the curve. 
  Short toe films require adequate exposure if they are to have detail in
the shadows, otherwise the exposure will fall below the point where the
shadow contrast is useable. I think this is one of the main problems people
have with T-Max. Despite the nostalgia for Double-X, I suspect it would
have exactly the same problem.
  Plus-X sheet film (the roll and 35mm films are a very different emulsion)
has tons of shadow detail, especially when exposed a couple of stops more
than the ISO speed indicates. The problem is that the highlight contrast
may become very high. The tonal reproduction is also distorted. When
compared to a short or medium toe film with a long straight line section,
and printing for the same shadow and highlight densities, the mid grays
will be darker with the long toe film. Makes for dramatic water and snow
scenes but may not be suitable for others. 
  I think sometimes the complexity of the Zone System hides the essential
simplicity of the relationships its based on. 
  I think it is useful to make a simple bracketing test. A series of
negatives photographed at normal speed, one stop overexposure, two stops
over exposure and one stop under exposure. Make enough negatives so that
you can develop a set at "normal" development, N-1 and N+1. How much change
you need in development is determined mostly by the film. For most films
the time change will be about +/- 30%, for T-Max films its about +/- 20%
  Print the resulting negatives on "normal" paper to see the differences,
and also on paper of the right contrast to give the best images from each. 
  Its also useful to compare a short and long toe film this way on the same
subject. 
  Note also that the contrast of a negative to be used in an enlarger will
be affected by the type of light source in the enlarger. Dichroic color
heads and cold light enlargers are very diffuse, condenser enlargers of the
common type are partially diffuse. The effect on most B&W film is about one
paper grade increase in contrast for the condenser type. The source has no
effect on curve or final results when contrast is matched. 
  Kodak gives development times for diffusion type enlargers. If lower
contrast negatives are desired for a condenser enlargers they are
essentially the same as N-1, i.e. less development and a loss of about 3/4
to one stop speed. The difference in contrast is about one paper grade. 
  Color transparencies and negatives, and B&W negatives on chromogenic B&W
film are not so affected. The dye particles are so small that there is
virtually no scattering from them and the contast is virtually the same
regardless of light source.

Yes.  Try using the camera with a darkcloth instead of a reflex viewer.  After
a while you won't even notice that the image is inverted.   Be sure that your
darkcloth is fully opaque, otherwise light coming through the cloth will reduce
the visibility of the image.   The Darkroom Innovations cloth is particular
ly nice, but it doesn't work well with the Technikardan (a great camera,
by the way).

You should use a magnifier or loupe for checking focus.  I recommend about X4.
Higher magnifications typically don't reveal more detail but do make the image
dimmer.  Others will disagree, it depends on the ground glass and the person.

  It would be like using ortho film in the camera. i.e. red objects would
be reproduced black. You really need pan film for this unless you want the
effect.

I second the DI darkcloth recommendation - an excellent product, especially
when it is windy outside.

The most effective technique I've come across for using a view camera
(I wear glasses, so I fiddled around with this until I found something I
like):

1) Compose the image roughly
2) Focus with a loupe
3) Apply swing/tilt/shift as needed (a *little* at a time)
4) Focus with a loupe
5) Now, move your head as far *away* from the ground glass as your darkcloth will
   allow (this is where the DI darkcloth really excels), wait 10 seconds or so,
   and look at the image you see (about 10-12" away) as little picture hanging in
   space.  This single step alone will do more to improve your pictoral sense
   than you can imagine.  With all the fiddling around a view camera requires,
   it is easy to get lost in the details and fail to see the final image as a
   *picture*.  

5a) If you do 1-5) above, you'll be amazed at how much you do *not* need a
    fresnel, Beattie, or other image intensifing apparatus (all of which give up
    some sharpness in favor of more light).

5b) The upside down/backwards properties of a view camera are a *strength* not a
    problem - these cause you to see the image in more abstract terms and give
    you big hints about compositional strength, image balance, dominant lines,
    positive/negative space, and so on.

In other words, if you are contemplating your first LF camera as the original poster
did, I would eshew light gathering gadgets (you can always get 'em later if needed)
and learn to use the view camera as a very powerful new way of seeing things...

If you'd like to take a peek at my darkroom, see:

http://www.tundraware.com/Darkroom

Some Details:

- I built this myself when I finished the basement in my new home 6 years ago.

- Enlarger is an Omega D-II push-up w/Zone VI VC Cold Light Head.

- The box you see under the enlarging table is a 20x24 paper safe I also built.

- Room is 10'x12' w/7' ceilings

- Sink is stainless steel 7'x30"x6"

- The assembly hanging beneath the sink holds print drying screens which
  pull out when needed.

- The frame you see on the left side of the dry side picture is a little
  cutaway I made between two of the wall studs (I put the drywall on the
  the *back* of these studs instead of the front).  This is where I
  hand rollfilm to dry.

- All outlets are Ground Fault Interruper protected so if they get sprayed
  with water, the GFI will pop for safety.

It is an incredible place to work - temp stays at 68 F all year long within
a degree or two.

Just a thought:

I know that freestyle sale Co. also has ortho films available.
Since freestyle's own brand film believed to made by Ilford
won't it be possible that Freestyle's ortho film also comes from Ilford ?

Actually, I just quickly scan their catalog, there are Arista(freestyle's
brand name) Ortho Litho film and Aristatone Copy film.

Aristatone is described as : " An orthochromatic, extended range, continuous
tone negative film. A 0.007 base with excellent dimensional stability....."

Mr. Thornton mentioned(see below) Ilford's own ortho film is also 7/1000
thickness.  

In freestyle's catalog:
Ilford Ortho +  : 8x10/25 $56.95
Aristatone copy: 8x10/50 $99.95

People may remember that I wrote in a month or so again with crystalization 
problems while mixing up developers from bulk chemicals. Well, after trying 
almost everything I can think of, the problem still won't go away!

Here are the details again - anyone who can think of any more suggestions, 
no matter how far fetched they sound, will be in my good-books forever! :

The problems always occurs when I add the Hydroquinone to the already-mixed 
Metol and Sodium sulphite. Within about 10 seconds the water turns opaque, 
then little 'clouds' of crystals and air bubbles start to separate out into 
the solution. These loose clumps of crystals and bubbles get largers until 
the bubbles rise to the top leaving the crystals to settle to the bottom of 
the jar as a fine 'crunchy' sedament.
This isn't a huge problem when I'm making paper developer. I can shake up 
the solution, dilute it, and find no problem with development. But, I'm a 
little more concerned about the film developers...

I'm using clean glass jars to mix up the solutions, have the water at 42 
degree (celcius), and mix the chemicals in plenty of water ( e.g. Metol-10g, 
Sodium sulphite-80g, Hydroquinone-20g to 750mls of water).

One of my big frustrations is that I want to start selling some of my own 
developers, but really don't want to put a 'shake before use' note on the 
bottle! ;-)

Any chemists out there - help! You'll have my eternal gratitude.

1.  For medium and longer focal lengths, try using a cardboard frame for
composition, rather than the camera focusing screen.  I have an 8"x10"
black cardboard, with a 4"x5" inch cutout that I use.  With a bit of
practice, you can judge the correct eye-frame distance for a particular
lens.  The advantage of this technique is that the frame is much more
convenient to move than the camera, and the view is right side up and
bright.  It doesn't work so well with wide angle lenses.

2.  For viewing the camera focusing screen, use a dark cloth rather than
the reflex viewer.  Have glasses made that allow you to view the whole
screen with both eyes from a comfortable distance for composition.  Use
a loupe for fine focusing.

3.  I've found that a good quality ground glass/fresnel lens combination
is as good or better than the Boss screen.  Others prefer the "premium"
screens.

4.  If you do replace the screen, be sure to check the placement of the
screen relative to the film plane.  (I found a significant error in the
location of the Boss screen specified for my camera.)

5.  If you don't need to carry the camera for long distances, get wide
angle lenses with large maximum apertures.

Chuck,  As Richard noted a pan film may be your best bet.  However, if there is
no red, it may not matter.  A more accurate rendering will be made using a pan
film such as TMax 100 or Delta 100, FP4+ come to mind.  I have seen several of
my students try an ortho film with better than expected results.  Since it is a
new interpretation, you can always give it a try.  I would avoid objects or
scenes that are deep red though.

Have fun!  I do have an opening or two in my weekend platinum workshop at the
end of September : ) ($$)  It really is not that expensive.

Dang good thing you are a thousand miles away and the end of Sept is the
busiest time for my photography or I'd be in trouble again!
 I did figure that red would give me a bit of trouble but have tried running
images through PhotoShop to see what they would look like with the red
altered. Many would work.....but I guess that I'd better stick with films
that are designed for negs from slides. I have several images that were made
when I was out of B&W holders and had a sheet or two of color left. I always
figure that the rare light will pop out every time I shoot the last holder!
:o)

I also own and use the DI focusing darkcloth but I've experienced quite a
few quality problems with it.

After about a year and a half of light use the elastic band broke. DI
replaced/repaired the darkcloth free of charge but I had to pay for the cost
of shiping the darkcloth. After I got it back, the stitching near the
elastic band end began to unravel which required me to repair this myself.

Bottom line for me is I love the product but I think the quality could be
improved.

I've recently started using a borrowed 8x10 camera and the darkcloth is the
"old fashioned" kind and I really miss the DI darkcloth. So it is a good
product.

Tim And Lorena,  My work space / darkroom is 700 sq. ft.  It has a 16 foot x 38"
wooden sink made out of several sheets of marine ply wood with splash boards
that are 9" high.  It is a great pleasure to be able to set up a developing line
that has 9 11 x14 trays for complete one pass archival processing.  It will also
handle up to three 30x40 trays.  I would feel a bit closed in Tim.  I do wish
though, that with all that space I did have an 8x10 enlarger.  alas three 4x5
still don't add up to 8x10.

Tim I didn't see a sound system.  Surely you listen to something while you work
: )

And grabbing those Snickers Bars with Pyro on your gloves is probably not a 
good plan.

Rob, It will open up a whole new world to you.    I should mention that the
whole space goes dark.  I work by myself so I don't contend with the need
for a separate dark room to come and go. I have yet to put a safe light in
the fridge though.  no snacking while I'm dark.

Take a piece of fishing chord and attach it to the board, then measure the string
and tie knots in it for the different focal lengths of the lenses that you have.
Keep in mind that where eye is, that is the film back, and the cardboard hole is
the where the lens would be.  I find this a great way to pre compose your shoot.

I owned the Technikardan and used the DI darkcloth with it, without any
problems that I recall. The DI cloth does come in two versions, a studio and
a field version. I think it is best to use the studio version with the
Technikardan. Possibly using the field version accounted for Don's problems
(or perhaps I've forgotten something in the years since I owned the
Technikardan).

I presently have a Technika and I don't think it does work well with that
camera. The problem is that the elastic gets in the way of the four knobs
that you loosen and tighten when swinging or tilting the back. It's
difficult to operate the knobs with the darkcloth on the camera and then
when they get loosened it's hard to move the back with the darkcloth on. I
end up taking the darkcloth off to operate the knobs and then putting it
back on very loosely, kind of draping it, to observe the ground glass while
moving the back. Fortunately I don't use back movements very often but if I
did I think I'd get another darkcloth (or another camera).

That is news to me. When I ordered the darkcloth, DI asked me my camera size
only and never mention studio vs. field (and has never mentioned it since
during my subsequent phone calls).

This is beig used on a Wisner BTW, but we are getting way off topic for this
list.

I have been told by higher level tech reps from Eastman Kodak that Super XX
characteristics were the target when they came up with TMax. They wanted a
modern film that would pull and push easily and would be sharper than the
older films. TMax does this well and with smaller time changes than the
older film. It has to be processed with the same precision as color films to
take advantage of its capabilities, a characteristic that makes it difficult
for many who aren't too precise in the darkroom.

When using TMax films, especially TMax 100, if you are off a small bit with
the shadow placement you get empty shadows, there is no 'slop factor' at
all. When using a red filter you are in even more trouble if you don't
account for the films extended red sensitivity-you lose almost everything in
the deeper shadows, the effect increasing as you go to higher altitudes.

With the ability of TMax films to record detail in what seems to be a never
ending high end, exposing the important shadows on zone IV or even higher
can solve the problems with losing too much in the deeper shadows.

I believe we're all suitably jealous Tim! A darkroom like that is still one 
of my 'one day' wishes... I work in a tiny laundry at home, or the community 
darkroom at the university. Fortunately (or not so fortunate really) I'm 
usually the only one working in there... And at home, it's a battle for 
floorspace with the washing machine. Definitely standing room only!

It would be interesting to see or hear about anyone elses work spaces...

Well at least I've got the enlarger for that dream darkroom.;-) (I'm working 
on it slowly.) A friend/ex-lecturer swapped me an old 8x10 enlarger for a 
packet of coffee last year. It does need a lot of work though. New bellows, 
lens, etc... It'll be the first thing that goes into that future darkroom.
What kind of enlarger do you use?

Thanks to Dan and Richard for the film characteristics tips! The part about
the SuperXX and Tmax relationship will help! I'm now rating my Tmax 400
sheet film at 125 instead of the 250 I worked out in test.  Or I am  placing
the shadow detail on at least zone 4 and things are working better ....but I
am almost always needing more shadow detail than most folks due to my
subjects.  This explains why the random over exposure { every now and then
when I'm shooting Transparences I will forget to reset my meter for B&W
....:o) } and the good quality I usually get when printing it. I shoot a lot
of 8x10 chrome film and have absolutely no problems with hitting the
exposures exactly but have had much sorrow since switching to the T max
films { I would switch back but want to use the Readyloads for
backpacking }.....Just elevating the exposure for the shadow detail is
almost too simple and I've not been able to mentally accept that all or most
of all the problem was underexposure since the chromes that I shoot are so
close to the exact exposure constantly.  Glad for the reminder on the red
areas with the red filter problem as I use it often to help move certain
tones around that often fall near the low zones. We have a lot of rust
colored leaves and rocks.

 It might be interesting for you to try some Plus-X. The characteristic has
an almost constant rise in contrast with density. It may not give you what
you want but the effect of the very long toe may be a useful clue in
figuring out how to reproduce the shadow areas.
  H&D curves are available for Kodak color materials. While the curves for
transparency materials is not quite the same thing as for negative film it
should still give an idea of how linear the film is in the shadow areas. .
  The big problem in making reflection prints, either B&W or color, is that
the range of brightness available from a normally illuminated print is much
less than it typical in the original scene. Transparencies generally are
illuminated either on light boxes or by projection. In either case the
highlight brightness is usually much greater than the ambient light.
Reflection prints require reducing the range of the original brightness by
some means. The Zone System allows compressing (or expending) the range by
adjustment of exposure and development such that any brightness range in
the subject can be recorded as a fixed range of densities in the negative.
The idea is to make the range of brightness reproduceable within the fixed,
limited, range of the printing paper. 
  L.A.Jones developed the familiar "quad" chart on which the reproduction
curve can calculated. 
  The problem with the Zone System is that simple compression or expansion
of contrast may not result in a visually pleasing image. A high contrast
object reproduced with lower contrast may simply look low contast. Further,
the eye looks at "local" contrast, so that reducing overall contrast may
result in loss of apparent detail in textures.
  Manual burning and dodging or selective masking may be the only answer
here. 
  Another factor in relying on the Zone System is that it has _no_ effect
on the shape of the film curve, which as I have pointed out, is very
influential in the final tonal reproduction. The film curve can cause the
contrast to vary from shadow to mid-tone, and from mid-tone to highlight.
Older films typically had a shoulder at densities low enough so that it was
reached by the highlights of an ordinary fairly high contrast scene. A film
with both a fairly long toe and early shoulder is S shaped. Some older
films, especially higher speed films, had virtually no straight line area
of the curve. These films were often accused of highlight blocking. The
contrast of the highlights was low enough so that than detail was lost.
(The old Kodak Super-Panchro-Press is an example). Modern films have
virtually no shoulder, so the contrast of the highlights continues at a
high value until very great exposures are reached. 
  The results may be highlight blocking, this time because of the limits of
the printing medium. The difference is that masking or manual burning in
can fix this sort of blocking because the detail is in the film, where it
was lost completely in the films with low density shoulders. 
  The problem with films which maintain high contrast into the shadow and
highlight areas is how to compress these areas to obtain the visual effect
desired in the print. I have no definite answer to this but post the above
as a stimulus to thought and with the idea that an examination of what is
going on directly on the film may be useful to those fighting this problem. 
  Kodak has the best film data. Their film data sheets have real, not
idealized, film curves. Its interesting and useful to compare the curves
for various films. All these data sheets (really brochurs) are avialable as
PDF documents from the Kodak web site. I find printing them out makes them
much easier to read than viewing on the screen, either in PDF or HTML format.

list of many interesting documents.

Dr. Douglas Nishimura, of the Image Permanence Institute, has recently
posted a couple of very interesting articles to the rec.photo.darkroom
Usenet group.  One covers the permenance of printing paper and changes in
paper base used for FB. The other discusses storage of negatives and prints
with an evaluation of the materials available for storage. Use Deja.com and
do an author search to find them. 
  One thing he says is that the paper by James Rielly of IPI on the
stability of RC paper is obsolete. This paper is available from the Kodak
site and from Thom Bell's site.
  Doug says there are still problems with the TiO2 layer and that RC paper
should not be used for long term display. It shold _never_ be framed under
glass or plastic. 
  See his posts for more. 
  This is as close to the horse's mouth as you are going to get.
  The tone of his post also suggests to me that he considers Henry
Wilhelm's work valid. This is important since there have been rumors that
the IPI thought Wilhelm had made errors in his experimental procedures. 
  From Doug's comments untoned RC prints can start to become degraded
within days, maybe even hours, if displayed in particulary hostile
environments.
  Also, if you have an Ozone machine to freshen the air, get rid of it. The
Ozone will attack both RC and fiber images very quickly.

...Snipped.............................

Went to the Kodak site after you mentioned the Plus X curves last week. I
found the difference you mentioned in the toe.
.........am going to try it against a couple of other films as soon as some
can be ordered.
 My densitometr gives me 250 as a film speed for the 8x10 tmax 400 but even
though I get the shadows on the paper in the right place they are much
flatter than I've been used to. The detail is there but flat,flat,flat.  I
did use TriX for flat scenes and Plus X for normal contrast in the 1970's
but never really tested them against Tmax as I had switched to HP5  brefore
the Tmax came out. I found very similar results with the Tmax and HP5 except
for the grain structure. In 8x10 I'm not too worried about grain structure
but drifted toward the Tmax as I can purchase it locally.{ I live in a
Photography materials challenged area! :o) }. Wish now that I had tested the
PlusX against Tmax before!
  I do seem to be getting better results since I started to expose more and
move up the curve for Tmax but always had the highlight blocking fears from
my earlier  photo days.
  Shot a tourist type scene with white painted lighthouse with bright sky
and dark overhanging tree limbs that should have blocked up the white of the
lighthouse against the sky.....held fine to my surprise and the dark wooded
area I was shooting from was placed in zone 5!
  .....as has been discussed recently by others on the list I'm having quite
good results by much higher placement of my shadows than the densitometer
recommends!  This scene was printed by Michael Smith on AZO in Amidol for me
and really snapped with no burning or dodging except for evening out light
fall off as I used a 120mm lens on 8x10 with no center filter. Michael is a
wonderful printer but had no trouble at all on number 2 AZO. Very good
shadow separation and still good separation of the white lighthouse and sky.
 I'm a convert as far as Tmax is concerned but it still seems odd to shoot
Tmax 400 at 125 or place the shadows on zone 5.
  Thanks for everyone's help as I am very stubborn about changing technique
this much!
  Still bothers me to read a properly calabrated spot meter off of the areas
that I want in shadow and shoot with the given reading with no
compensation....but I do like the prints!!

  BTW, this applies to sheet film not roll or 35mm film. Kodak, in their
infinite yellow and red  wisdom sell two very different emulsions under
virtually the same name. Roll and 35mm Plus-X are medium toe films. The
sheet film is the stuff with the very long toe. The same for Tri-X except
that both types of emulsion are available in 120 rolls. See the data sheets
for more.
  As a result of this thread I've been re-reading the section on tonal
reproduction in _Fundamentals of Photographic Theory_ T.H.James and George
C. Higgins. 
  The discussion in the first and second editions seems to be about
identical. I strongly recommend finding this book and reading this section.
It is based on Jones' work plus other stuff. I think it will help anyone
who wants a better understanding of how the photographic process reproduces
images. Its not technical in the sense that you don't need a background in
chemistry or much math to understand it. There is a lot of practical
information.
  This is not being suggested as a replacement for the Zone System, rather
it is the foundation on which the Zone System is built. The Zone System is
an organized way of making the sort of information in this chapter practical.
  What makes Jones' work so interesting is that he took into account the
psychological aspects of vision along with the sensitometry. This is
important because you _can't_ believe your eyes. Our perceived visual world
is filled with optical illusions. An understanding of those illusions is
useful to the artist using photography as a medium as it is in other visual
arts. 
  The book is not too rare, check your library for it before setting out on
a book search. Most libraries in the US have some sort of interlibrary loan
system so you can get books from the big libraries even if there is not one
near you.
  There is also a version of the same material in _Theory of the
Photographic Process_ C.E.K.Mees, both the original and "revised" edition,
but that is likely harder to find than the above. 
  The original research papers by Jones, Jones and Condit, et.al. were
scattered in several scientific journals over the years. The book form is
much easier to find. 
  A note. When the Kodak Labs were established by Mees, it was decided to
publish scientific papers in established, peer-reviewed, journals rather
than in a Kodak house organ. This made the papers much more respectable but
also sometimes makes them hard to find since there was no central journal.
For many years Kodak published a monthly(?) called "Abridged Scientific
Publications" or some title near that (going by memory and too much
coffee). It listed papers by both Kodak researches and others in the
general fields of science affecting photography. If you can find a library
who has them they are a very valuable resource.
  Another note: (I seem to have runaway fingers) I recently did a search
for "tabular grain" on the US patent and trademark office site
http://www.uspto.gov  I got a landslide of stuff all full of cross
references. Nonetheless its interesting. The first patents for T-grain seem
to have come from Ciba-Geigy but Kodak seems to have been the first to use
the technique for practical pictorial films. 
  If you want to spend several hours in intense, puzzling, fascinating
reading duplicate this search. There is nothing like reading patent
literature for making your brain buzz, a fact no doubt "well known to those
skillful in the art":-)

  When testing a new film or developer I routinely make a strip of
exposures of 14 or 15-stop range; of the films I've tested the only one
that blocks at a really low range is Tech Pan, and probably most of us who
have used TP have seen that as blank, detailless, contrastless light tones.
  Of TMX, Delta 100, Delta 400 and HP5+, they show almost dead-straight
curve shapes once exposure is up off the toe through the top end of that
range in most developers I've used with them. The odds of blocking them up
is imho rather low; of course the odds or being able to print that range is
rather low too. <g>

Yes I too very much appreciated his postings. I hope he stays around too.
He certainly puts the cat amongst the pidgeons regarding washing - as
Richard has been doing too recently.
He also suggests toning our negs for protection. How many people routinely
do that here I wonder?

Recently I experienced an interesting curling issue with a batch of
unmounted 5x7 RC prints which I found rather curious.  I live in Santa
Clara, California where the prints were made and took them to
Breckenridge, Colorado when they curled like leaves before my eyes as
the packet was opened.  I believe that this was due to the difference in
relative humidity between these two locations.  At Breckenridge
(elevation approx. 10,000 feet) this is very low, I can't be exact about
it but quite possibly as low as 5%.  The relative humidity in Santa
Clara is not exactly tropical but never drops below approx. 40%.  The
prints were made on FORTE Polywarmtone RC Plus, washed according to the
manufacturer's instructions for 8 minutes (seems a long time to me) and
air dried for about 5 weeks before being shipped in the plastic bag that
the printing paper is supplied in.

This is probably nothing that the pile of books I left on top of the
prints can't fix but I was curious about this and wondered if anyone has
any comments.  I don't usually make unmounted 5x7 RC prints but it did
make me wonder how to eliminate this if ever I get the burning urge to
do it again.

I suspect this would not have happened had they not been transported in the
plastic bag and  experienced virtual instantaneous humidity decompression on
opening, so to speak.

I had a box of Forte FB 8x10 purchased from another photographer in another
state behave similarly soon after opening it. The paper curled rather
significantly.  A few months later, to my surprise, I reopened the box and
found the paper flat again.

Cheers,

J.R.

What kind of water are you using?
Were the bulk chemicals bought fresh?
What color is the Hydroquinone?
Are you allowing the Metol/sulfite solution to cool before adding the Hydroquinone?
How do you clean your mixing tools and containers?

			yours you had me both puzzled and curious,

that mean that any of us pure-silver list subscribers can have use of it 
should we happen to be travelling through your area?  (Couldn't resist!)

  8 minutes does seem a little long for RC.
  The curling is caused by differential shrinkage, the emulsion is
shrinking more than the support. Its possible that RC paper curls more than
fiber because the dimentional stability of the support is greater. That is,
unprotected paper can shrink or expand with changes in RH so that the
difference between support and emulsion may be less. 
  I've found that RC prints stored loose curl up when the RH is very low.
If they have been stored in a stack they start to curl in a few minutes
when removed. 
  Its possible that using a print flattener may help. This is a bath of
some hygroscopic compound, typically Glycerine, which tends to hold
moisture in the emulsion. OTOH, the stored moisture is detremental to
permanence because it can support both chemical changes and mold. 
  Flatener formulas vary over a 2:1 range, anywhere from 60 to 125 ml of
Glycerine to 1 liter of water. Soak the prints for a fwe minutes, squeegee
and allow to dry. 
  The curled prints can be straightened by re-humidifying them. Put them in
the bathroom and turn out the shower with hot water. The prints will
straighten out but will curl up again as soon as returned to dry air. 
  Film does the same thing but most film has an anti-curling coating of
gelatin on the back which reduces the effect.

Lets see - sea level to 10,000 ft?  Altitude acclimation?  Need to bring up
slowly so they do not get altitude sickness.   <grin, grin>
  Also it is getting on to Fall up there..

Hi,

Some time ago I saw a message from C.J. Cheng referring to post flashing the
print when it's already in the developer. This has intrigued me since then -
could somebody please explain what is the difference between flashing the
print undeveloped or half developed? I read with great interest the thread
about pre or post flashing.

Anders Blomqvist, Finland

I think Daniel Bouzard may have solved my problem offlist. He suggests a 
case of too much metol in the formula... (10g metol, 80g sodium suphite, 20g 
hydroquinone, etc...) I'm yet to make further tests, but will post my 
results when I do.

I first saw this post -flash from Mr. Thornton's book: " Elements"
so I try it... Since Mr. Thornton is active in this mailing list, I believe
he will explains in details to you :-)

Later, I found in a book: " Photographic Printing" also mention this method
and as I can recall, fashing paper halfway in development is different from
pre; post flashing papers under enlargers. Simply put, a 'semi-developed'
paper has a 'shadow mask' that will bulk light go through, hence only
highlight will be flashed.

What I like this method is that, unlike flashing under enlarger which you
can not see images, you can dodge/burning during your post dev. flashing

I also feel it is more convenient compared to flash papers under enlargers.

I use a dimmer to control the lamp that hung above developer tray( thus
flashing time can be reasonable 'long', no hurry yet no solarisation.

When flashing, the papers should be pulled out from developer.

Best regards,
C.J. Cheng

"I use a dimmer to control the lamp that hung above developer tray( thus
flashing time can be reasonable 'long', no hurry yet no solarisation."

By the way, the result is very repeatable and controllable when flash
time is long enough (so you need a dimmer)

I hadn't thought to use post-flash during development to help with highlight 
detail. (I usually pre-flash, and only under dire circumstances!) Exessive 
post-flash half way through development causes what is commonly called 
'solarisation'.
It darkens the highlights, giving almost a half negative / half positive 
effect. Unfortunately the midtones become the 'highlights' giving very dark 
low contrast negs.
For best results, it's better to solarise the negative and boost the 
contrast in printing. This will take lots of experimentation. - The results 
are unpredictable.

Hello.
One thread has been the different responses of various film types to
filters. It seems as though TMAX differs significantly from the
traditional responses of panchromatic film. Are Delta100 / FP4+ / HP5+
more akin to the traditional bunch where you would expect
red/orange/yellow
to increase contrast and blue to reduce it? or are these modern
emulsions as strange as TMAX?
Scott.
Never mind the shapes of characteristic curves. The learning curve
just gets steeper and steeper! Is there a shoulder anymore??? (Was
there ever one?)

Some time ago I saw a message from C.J. Cheng referring to post flashing the

about pre or post flashing.

Anders
I wrote of this technique in my book 'Elements' (ISBN 1 873319 07 X), page
142. As soon as a print is placed in the developer its sensitivity to light
is greatly reduced. This makes it easier to control the amount of flashing
light. A dim light placed on the darkroom ceiling above the dish can be
switched on for a few seconds to have the same effect as normal pre or post
flash. BUT because the image can be seen, it is possible to dodge or burn
with the flashing light in quite intricate areas.
If the flash is given in the early stages of development, just as the image
is appearing, there is no pseudo-solarisation which I find an unpleasant
effect. I use Agfa Neutol WA as my standard developer, and this gives a very
early appearance time - it rushes up the shadows then slows down to build
middle and high tones gradually. This makes it easier to flash in the very
early stages of development.
A refinement of the technique that can be used is to employ a pen cell torch
with a black paper cone taped to the front to create a very fine point of
light. I fill this cone with enough crumpled tissue paper to diffuse and
reduce the light output to manageable proportions. I can then 'draw' with
post flash light in precise areas of the emerging print image.

Richard
I would very much like to read these articles, and indeed am interested in
the rec.photo.darkroom usenet group generally.
Please forgive my ignorance of computer and internet methods, but how
exactly do I contact this group. I know it sounds silly, but what do I type
into the address line of my browser - Explorer 5? I feel very foolish asking
this, but maybe there are others like me who are ignorant in this internet
world.
Thanks
Barry Thornton

Dr. Douglas Nishimura, of the Image Permanence Institute, has recently
posted a couple of very interesting articles to the rec.photo.darkroom
Usenet group.  One covers the permenance of printing paper and changes in
paper base used for FB. The other discusses storage of negatives and prints
with an evaluation of the materials available for storage. Use Deja.com and
do an author search to find them.
  One thing he says is that the paper by James Rielly of IPI on the
stability of RC paper is obsolete. This paper is available from the Kodak
site and from Thom Bell's site.
  Doug says there are still problems with the TiO2 layer and that RC paper
should not be used for long term display. It shold _never_ be framed under
glass or plastic.
  See his posts for more.
  This is as close to the horse's mouth as you are going to get.
  The tone of his post also suggests to me that he considers Henry
Wilhelm's work valid. This is important since there have been rumors that
the IPI thought Wilhelm had made errors in his experimental procedures.
  From Doug's comments untoned RC prints can start to become degraded
within days, maybe even hours, if displayed in particulary hostile
environments.
  Also, if you have an Ozone machine to freshen the air, get rid of it. The
Ozone will attack both RC and fiber images very quickly.

Scott
I find a tiny increase in sharpness with unsharp masking, and it does effect
tonality. I usually prefer the appearance of a print from a standard
DiXactol negative which is aggressively sharp anyway. If you expose and
develop for unsharp masking(a much contrastier negative), as Howard Bond
does, then mask gives increased apparent sharpness and the tonality is
different. Sometimes I prefer this tonality, sometimes I don't. However, the
increased sharpness gained is offset by the loss of sharpness incurred by
longer initial negative development time in my opinion.
If you were working with a standard developer, such as Xtol or D76, without
the pronounced edge effects of DiXactol, I think the sharpness gain from
unsharp masking would be greater.
So I find its effects from a sharpness point of view marginal - the last few
percent of sharpness. I tend to use the technique only to rescue the many
underexposed and over developed negatives from printing clients (they don't
even know that I have used the technique), or to rescue the occasional
negative of my own where I slip up on exposure and development really badly.
The example in my next book falls exactly into this latter category. In this
case there is a welcome sharpness gain as well as a tonal correction simply
because I seriously overdeveloped in the first place.
The answer is to suck it and see Scott.
The sharpness effect will vary according to the amount of unsharpness of the
mask - controlled by the amount of spacing of the mask film from the
negative during the mask's exposure. Just like the horrible overuse of the
unsharp masking filter in Photoshop and other software we see in too many
digital images, it is very easy to overdo the effect in conventional
darkroom work, I find, to produce obvious halos around tonal masses in the
image.

You have written that you are passionate about sharpness.
Why then do you not use unsharp masking more?
Is it a question of time? Or are there "other things" I have yet to
discover?
And with reference to DiXactol, if a chosen negative is to be
subjected to unsharp masking, is the stain a consideration?(help or
hindrance?) or an irrelevance?
Hope you don't mind the questions
Scott

  I will contact you via e-mail about setting up a news reader, there is
one in IE but it has to be opened separately from the web browser.
Meanwhile, the easiest way to read Usenet groups is to use the  Deja News
web site http://www.deja.com  On the home page, near the top is a banner
reading something like "Looking for Usenet? click here". Click it there. It
will come up with a menu of group prefixes, you want "rec". click on that
and and go to the second page of groups to find the "photo" groups. Deja
archives everything going back about two years. There is also a search
engine which searches news groups for subject, author, etc. The easiest way
to find postings by a particular person is to do an author search. For
these postings search for "nishimura". I also suggest searching for
"gudzinowicz" for more intersting stuff. Mike Gudzinowicz is a Phd chemist,
retired now I think, and really understands photographic chemistry. 
  There are some other articles written, or co-written, by Doug Nishimura
on the Conservation On Line site at http://palimpsest.stanford.edu  Again,
an author search is the fastest way to find stuff. There is a ton of
interesting stuff on this site.

Barry - Could you explain how you use unsharp masking to salvage
underexposed negatives? Since the effect of combining an unsharp mask with a
negative is to reduce the density range/contrast of the "sandwich" (and
hence allow you to print at a higher contrast which, as you say, will
slightly increase apparent sharpness), and since underexposed negatives tend
to be flat, it would seem that using an unsharp mask would only exacerbate
the underexposure problem. I ask the question because I have a bunch of
printable but underexposed negatives from a recent trip.  I use unsharp
masking fairly often but had not thought of it as a way of improving  these
negatives. Thanks. Brian

Sorry Brian if I misled. I meant only underexposed AND overdeveloped
negatives, which does raise contrast. There's no way of using unsharp
positive masking that I know of with purely underexposed negatives.
One device you might try, carefully with a trial negative first, is to
bleach back the negatives with a standard pot. ferri. bleach, then redevelop
in PMK. This will add a stain to the negative which improves printability
with a flat negative. You can actually go through the cycle of
bleach/redevelop in PMK several times to get maximum stain. Printing on
graded paper maximises the benefit of the stain in adding printable density.
The process does work with DiXactol too, but the added stain is greater with
PMK, though it is yellow in colour (hence the advice to use graded paper)
rather than DiXactol's brown.
If you experiment with this, it is obviously wise to ensure the negatives
are fully washed first since any residual fixer would turn the bleach into a
reducer, losing some of the faintest shadow detail.
Just a thought.

Barry
PS I guess NEGATIVE unsharp masking might help too if underexposure were
dire.

Try using a film that produces a neg dupe to add density or make two
generations from standard neg film.
Kodak SO 132 Ortho Direct Dupe is one.....dev in dektol or similar
developer.
try for a little more contrast than normal unsharp masking.
Kodak no.  8520272  {25 sheets 4x5 }
or no. 1591032 for 8x10
This is a newer film but the old version worked great to save some Thin,
thin, thin negs that I have had to do for folks at times. You can actually
assign the clear area to a slight gray and have another clear area to print
as pure black.....actually will allow for "faked in" tone similar to the
highlight flashing that Barry talked about  only you are filling in
"simulated shadow" while progressively adding almost any density you need to
the rest of the neg.. The second contact generation using standard ortho
type 3 {kodalith } in a dilute continuos tone developer will work also but
watch pinhole-ing  with this film in continuos tone developers. {very dilute
dektol will work but you have to test, test , test! }
 You can try a reg camera film but the ortho film with the added safelight
capacity is  much easier. Also if you use two generations of film to produce
a neg to add density you may have to produce a dense first generation to be
able to produce the second negative generation that is full ranged and only
dense enough to add the needed amount of density. That even confuses me so
lets try....positive generation sometimes needs to be dense to produce a
thin second generation neg.
Glad to help more but still trying to get away for some photography so might
be slow on answering!

Hi Chuck - Thanks for the information. I don't think these negatives are so
bad (or so good, from an artistic standpoint) to need/deserve that much
effort but it's nice to know about these kinds of things. Brian

After reading the Nishimura article on microfilm
preservation (which seemed to relate well to all
silver images) it seems that indeed it is sulfiding
that is the most protective aspect of archival
processing. Slight amounts of residual fixer were much
less destructive than originally thought. He made
mention of the use of very dilute polysulfiding toner,
specifically Kodak Brown Toner, in dilutions as low as
1:200 in concentration. Could this be the replacement
for "archival toning in selenium?" And what do you
think the color changes to cold tone papers would be
at such a dilute concentrastion. I wonder how "brown"
our images will become. 

Any thoughts?

  I have posted a series of questions to Dr. Nishimura. I want to prepare a
summary of factors in processing for permanence. I have asked him if he is
willing to review what I write before posting. 
  One of the questions is what to use for toning where image protection is
wanted without change in image color or density. I think Kodak Brown Toner
can be used but am waiting for some recommendations. 
  Toning is usually thought of in terms of prints but it can also be used
for film. Pictorial film is much coarser grained than either microfilm or
printing paper. The large grain size makes it more resistant to attack by
polutants but it is still vulnerable. I hope to get some answers soon and
will post my summary both here and to the darkroom news group.
  Basically, what I have done is offer to do the writing if he makes sure I
get everything right. 
  BTW, its intersting that the longest lasting medium listed on Henry
Wilhelm's site is a form of Carbon print. I think he has one with an
estimated life of 500 years!
  Of course, all this assumes good archival storage. Displayed prints will
have a limited life no matter how well processed they are. Toning extends
the life, but the more exposed prints are to the junk in the air the
shorter their lifetimes are.
  So, to make an image last no one must look at it! Aughhh.
