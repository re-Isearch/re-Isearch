Dean, I', still using a Zerostat I bought over 20 years ago for my vinyl 
collection.  Sadly I have not seen an ionising gun in years but they were 
sold in reasonable quantities by HiFi shops.  Have you tried them or raided 
any musically obsessed friends storage cabinets!

Cheers

;I am trying to find some information regarding reversal 
;processing of Tech.
;Pan. as a first stage to producing enlarged negatives for alt. 
;printing. 


Since I haven't seen any responses to this, I'll momentarily de-lurk to
share my protocol for reverse processing Tech Pan. My initial interest in
working out this protocol was to be able to produce black and white stereo
pairs with my Realist.  As such my protocol is directed more towards
pictorial results rather than duplicating negatives, but it may give you the
start you need to mess around with the first developer to adjust it to your
needs.

My concerns when working out this protocol were to maintain maximum density
for Dmax and get a Dmin that was clear film base for the top highlights in
an "average" scene.  The transparencies produced from this protocol have a
range of just over eight stops of exposure from Dmax to Dmin.  This gives me
the results I wanted for shooting, but necessitates accurate metering and
much bracketing.  

My first developer is HC110 with added sodium thiosulfate.  I settled on
this developer for a number of reasons.  My first attempts at reversing Tech
Pan were done using MQ developer formulas.  I never was able to get the
results that I wanted from any of the formulations that I tried so I decided
to try some PQ formulas.  Since I had about a gallon of HC110 concentrate on
the shelf at the time, I gave it a whirl first and got basically what I was
looking for.  I have since been messing around with mixing developers from
scratch again for the purpose of experimentation, but I still use HC110 for
the majority of the Tech Pan slides I process.

Note the amount of thiosulfate in my first developer.  Other workers use
much more in their formulation (I've seen eight times that much in some
formulas).  The thiosulfate is there to clear the highlights, but it is also
decreasing your Dmax at the same time.  I chose to work out the exposure and
developing to use the full range of density possible and use only a small
amount of thiosulfate to clean up the last little bit of density in the
highlights. This gives me very good densities in my blacks.

My second developer is HC110 again.  This is just because I have it down
from the shelf already.  The second developer can be anything you want.  You
can toss in a little sodium sulfide if you want warmer results.  Or you can
use the redeveloper from sepia toning as the second developer if you want
fully sepia toned images.  You can also tone the finished slides any way you
would tone a print for what ever effects you wish.

One caveat here:  I use this only with 35mm and 120.  I haven't tried this
protocol with sheet film so your mileage may vary.  Here is my protocol:


Expose: EI 12

Solutions:
First Developer:  1:20 HC110 + 2gram per liter sodium thiosulfate
Bleach: 9.5g potasium dichromate + 66g sodium bisulfate in 1 liter water
Clear Bath: 50g sodium sulfite in 1 liter water
Second Developer: 1:10 HC110

Protocol:
First Developer   	10 min
Wash				5 changes water
Bleach			3 min
Wash				until water comes out clear
Clear	Bath			2 min 
Wash				5 changes water
Expose			1 min each side to light
Second developer		5 min
Wash				5 changes water
Fix				3 min
Wash				5 changes water
Hypo Clear			1 min
Wash				10 min
Photoflo
Dry


Let me know if I can be of any additional help (that assumes that I was
helpful to start with :)

Good day Harry,

Seems no one else has anything to say on AG+ so I will put my 2 cents 
worth in.

I saw AG+ advertised in an older issue of Camera Arts magazine and called
them but they no longer were going to handling the magazine. I finally tracked
down a UK addres and purchased a copy of the magazine.

It is rather expensive but the magazine has no advertising what so ever.
It is published in the typical large European format (ie larger than 8 1/2
x 11).
The magazine is well produced and has articles that range from quite technical
(ie mixing, testing, using various types of developers) to artsy type
discussions
and various types of portfolios. Some very well know names appear as
authors as
well (mostly from europe and the UK but not exclusively). I think it is only 
published 4 times a year.

I believe that they have just recently gotten together with Ilford to offer 
something a bit more than just the magazine but the details escape me at the
moment.

All in all, I liked the copy of magazine that I had the chance to read but
its price is a bit off putting. I think I still have the subscription and
address details if you would like that information.

I obtained their address from the web, I believe through the British Journal
of Photography web site.  (below)

http://www.tbp.co.uk/bjp/index.shtml

Hope that helps

cheers, Graham

Are the shadows there for me to find, or placed there by my searching mind.
When I reach and find them gone, was I right or was I wrong?

i hate to ask this type of question, mainly because I don't like to "copy"
someone else's style, but I have a client who is bugging me to do a print
that looks simular to the recent work of Sally Mann.  So basically, i need
some info on tea toning.  i've done it before but usually with red zinger
for a pinkish cast.  anyone with ideas on what flavor she uses?

thanks

I was able to obtain some of the AG+ original inserts from Photo-Eye.  It
was my understanding that the original AG+ was purchased from its publisher
and that the current magazine is (somehow) different from its predecessor,
although I have not seen the current magazine.  The old inserts were
actually just as Graham described the current magazine, so perhaps there is
a significant carryover.  It was an odd operation, however.  When I
attempted to order an insert directly from the UK publisher (because
Photo-Eye did not have it in stock), the publisher wrote back to say that
they did not have it either and instead of sending my check back, they sent
me a random-selected back issue -- one which I already had.  That said, the
inserts were well worth the money.

I have recently bought an air ioniser for the darkroom as recommended by 
Barry Thornton. I purchased it from a chemist (druggist in USA?) it is used 
by asthmatics etc& it produces negative Ions--I guess it may have the same 
effect as those record cleaners, except it is on the whole time.I live in 
hopes of spotless negs! Saffron Branfoot.

As I understand it, Both Sally and Tom Baril prefer Tetley Brand Tea for all
their toning needs.

BTW - I very much appreciated reading all the recent posts about selenium!
Thanks for taking the time to share.

Hi,

I'm presently using an  Omega C700. Unfortunately, I can't really use it for 
6x6 & 6x7. I'm looking for something to upgrade to. 

I'm using a 105 Nikkor lens, with this lens, I can only get 8x8 in prints 
from 6x6 format & full frame 8 x 10's from my 6x7 negatives.

Any suggestions. I'd like to be able to have the ability to crop fairly 
liberaly. (I will not be doing any color work). I will be using the new 
enlarger for 35mm as well. From what I've read on this list (Curt & Richard) 
I'm sold on getting a condenser head (as oposed to a cold light).

Am I better off getting a 4x5 enlarger for quality build & rigidity 
etc...such as a D2V? Or is a medium format unit appropriate? I was 
considering getting a used Beseler 23C or possibly an Omega B8. Is the B8 
better than the 23C?

Any thoughts or suggestions would be great. I'm in the process of putting 
together a new "improved" darkroom & I want to start things properly with the 
appropriate enlarger!

Thanks,

Frederic

These work quite well - I had one installed which treats the air of the
entire home via the heating/cooling ducts of the house.  Several notes:

1) These do need periodic cleaning.  If you smoke or have especially
   particulate laden air in your part of the world, clean more often.

2) I would suggest running the cleaner for an appropriate time *before*
   loading film holders, but turning it off during the actual loading
   process - there is no value in having air moving around while you
   do this and it could cause a worse problem than the one you are 
   solving.


Let us know your results...

The answer to your question depends in large measure on your budget and whether
or not you intend to do color printing at some point.  In no case would I
go with an enlarger that cannot handle 4x5 negatives - this is a medium 
every serious photographer should explore at some point.  Also, what can
be found will vary by locale - I am giving you a US perspective in the
following...


B&W Only
--------

Budget:  I like (and own) a D-series Omega.  Cheap with lots of available used
         accessories.  They are a bit rickety and can be tricky to align, but I've
         used mine for years to make tack-sharp 16x20s from 6x6 negs.  Cost:
         under $500 for enlarger baseboard, one carrier, and light source.

Cost-No-Object:  For me it is a tie between the Zone VI Enlarger (2nd revision)
                 and the Saunders LPL-4500.  The Zone VI can be fitted with
                 an 8x10 light source, but has no evident means for color
                 in the future.  As one of my colleagues recently put it,
                 'The Saunders is the Honda of enlargers: flawlessly engineered,
                 reasonably priced, and a joy to use.'  Cost: $2000 and up


Color & B&W
-----------

I'd only consider an LPL-4500 in this case.  This enlarger can do B&W graded, B&W VC,
and color printing with equal facility...

pure-silver was dead this afternoon from about 1-7pm CST because the network

We are now back... if you sent something which does appear in the next few

>I'm presently using an  Omega C700.

  I recommend the Beseler 23C; parts and pieces for the old Omegas can be
rather difficult to find and expensive, while parts for the 23C are common.
  But with the glut of unwanted enlargers etc on the market, it may be time
to go to a 4x5 enlarger if you entertain any thought of working in that
format. Also, 4x5 enlargers can be less desirable on the markets because
they appear so huge.
  So..for 4x5, look for a clean Beseler 45, again because parts and
accessories are readily available new or used.

For what its worth, I would get a variable contrast head on a Saunders 4550
XLG (4x5 enlarger).  Is about $2,100, is built like a tank and the VC head
introduces the proper amount of ND (neutral density) to keep exposure fairly
constant as you change paper grade.

It doesn't have a lens turret, but that has not hung me up--changing is easy
and I keep an 80 and a 50 mm lens on separate boards.  Plus, if you decide
to do color, a color head is $600.

This is my second enlarger and I really am happy with my choice.  I do not
work for Sunders or any affiliates of them.

Subject: enlarger suggestions?


Hi,

I'm presently using an  Omega C700. Unfortunately, I can't really use it for

6x6 & 6x7. I'm looking for something to upgrade to. 

I'm using a 105 Nikkor lens, with this lens, I can only get 8x8 in prints 
from 6x6 format & full frame 8 x 10's from my 6x7 negatives.

Any suggestions. I'd like to be able to have the ability to crop fairly 
liberaly. (I will not be doing any color work). I will be using the new 
enlarger for 35mm as well. From what I've read on this list (Curt & Richard)

I'm sold on getting a condenser head (as oposed to a cold light).

Am I better off getting a 4x5 enlarger for quality build & rigidity 
etc...such as a D2V? Or is a medium format unit appropriate? I was 
considering getting a used Beseler 23C or possibly an Omega B8. Is the B8 
better than the 23C?

Any thoughts or suggestions would be great. I'm in the process of putting 
together a new "improved" darkroom & I want to start things properly with
the 
appropriate enlarger!

Thanks,

Frederic

        I agree with Tim about the Omega D series.  I have a Chromega 4x5 that I have
wall mounted.   I have added some structural components to make the unit more rigid.
Either Omega or others have made accessories so that you can do almost anything at all
with a D series, except for adding an 8x10 light source.
        I think that the best enlarger, for up to 6x9 negs is the Leitz Focomat IIc.
They are no longer made and they are expensive, around 2K but they include 2 lenses.  .

        A dear friend of mine owned one of the zone VI's enlargers and he hated it, it
was not well made at all.  in fact he replaced it with an ancient Elwood.

Tim,

And, the LPL4500 (LPL-7451 or 7452 in Europe if we are talking about the
same animal) has a Heiland "split-grade" module available for it from
Germany. Erwin Puts reviewed it in Leica Fotographie recently, and in C&D
next issue. Actually, Heiland makes the modules for many enlargers from
Leica V35 to Durst Lab 1200. Cost varies according to the head it goes into,
but the results are painlessly excellent from this method of working.

I recently touted the "Film and Darkroom Cookbook."  The recent enlarger
questions reminded me of another good book: "Post Exposure" by Ctien. 
This is an exhaustive treatment of the technical factors involved in
getting a print from a negative.  He has a chapter on line at his web
site: http://www.plaidworks.com/ctein/WELCOME.HTM  Well worth a visit.
	Any enlarger is only as good as it's alignment.

I have been using a Bionair F100 for some years now, I leave the thing on all 
the time and it has noticeably reduced the amount of dust in circulation.  
With much relief I can say that I do little or no spotting but indulge in a 
dust "dance" whenever I place a neg into the carrier.  The intro is a wipe 
with an anti static brush followed by a squirt from a zerostat and then a 
quick puff of compressed air.

It works for me!

Cheers

Marten

It all started with a publication called "The SIlverprint Manual", produced
by Eddie Ephraums and Martin Reed back in the late 80s.  This was a
loose-leaf binder with a whole series of inserts covering camerawork, film
processing, printing etc and was sold as a "partwork" - i.e you pay a
subscription and they keep sending you updates which eventually builds into
a huge reference work.  Unfortunately, for whatever reason, this didn't
last very long which is a pity because it's an exhaustive work, as far as
it goes.  The monthly updates first turned into "Silverprint magazine",
which IIRC lasted one issue after which there was some sort of parting of
the ways and the whole thing got relaunched as "AG+ Photographic", owned
and edited by Eddie Ephraums.  Eddie ran this for some years, eventually
selling the title on to the present owners Timothy Benn, publishers of the
British Journal of Photography.  It's half the size it used to be but still
a thoughtful and well produced publication.  It's published four times a
year, and details should be on the BJP website http://www.bjphoto.co.uk

Hope this helps!

Regards
Richard

I have ionizers all over the house.  I get them off QVC on television cheap.  
I even have small portables for hotel rooms, one for my truck and a special 
one for the kitchen.  They ARE incredible for removing dust, smoke etc out of 
the air.  Make sure you keep them at least 10 feet away from your computer, 
tapes or anything slightly magnetic... They change the electric charge of 
dust which makes impurities stick to something positive...mostly a wall next 
to the ionizer..within a few weeks you have to start washing the wall down as 
all the dust will stick to it or anything near the machine....I understand it 
can zap a hard drive by the charges it submits.

I have allergies...it has done wonders for my breathing.  I have used mine 
for over 10 years

Interesting question to which I don't have an answer.  I had never
of this till now; if these inserts were available from the UK then
it may be an earlier incarnation of the present magazine.

Any UK members on the list care to comment???


cheers, Graham

Are the shadows there for me to find, or placed there by my searching mind.
When I reach and find them gone, was I right or was I wrong?

Marten,

For several years I too have used a Canadian Bionaire air-cleaner (F-150
model) in my 6 x 8 x 7ft high darkroom. Like you I leave it on all the time,
so dust is not really a problem any more, although I have to say that living
in the country is much cleaner than in a town... apart from all the sheep
and cow crap one skids in on the lane outside every day  8-(

I'm not convinced that the ionizers do as good a job as
running a big HEPA filter for a few minutes while setting
up shop.  I have a honeywell HEPA thing that I am quite
happy with, and it moves a lot of air through the filters.

I don't mean to sound critical, but how old are you?  I guess you don't 
remember vinyl LP (long playing) records?  I suppose if you are young enough 
you just might not.  They were what..  about 12 inches diameter, made of 
vinyl, and they used to get a nice static charge when pulling them out of the 
sleeves.  Of course then they'd attract dust like a magnet attracts iron 
filings.

The Zerostat was designed to elminate the static charge, so dust wouldn't be 
attracted... and you don't get (as much) of the bacon frying noise in the 
background.

They stopped making them several years ago.  Incidentally, I still have all 
my LP's, and a turntable to play them on. It has a nice layer of dust on it 
though.  :-)

Hi,

First I should introduce myself as I'm new to this list - my name is Guy
Brown, I'm based in Sheffield, United Kingdom and I'm a keen monochrome
hobbyist. Most of my current stuff is shot on Kodak High Speed Infrared.

My interest in infrared led me to try some of the "lith lookalike"
techniques that Tim Rudman describes in his excellent book on lith
printing. However, I have a query about the bleach-then-selenium-tone
technique.

I'm using Ilford MGIV RC, and bleaching back in a conventional
ferricyanide/bromide bleach. According to Tim's book, such a bleached
print can be immersed directly in selenium (I'm using Kodak Rapid
Selenium Toner 1+9) and some redevelopment will occur. I don't really
see this: there is a subtle colour change accompanied by some lightening
of the image, and after two 16x12" prints a nasty sludge appears in the
selenium toner which stains any subsequent prints. At a guess, I suspect
that the (unstable) bleached silver is being displaced by the selenium,
and is appearing in solution.

So, the questions are:

* Am I doing anything wrong?

* Can anyone explain the chemistry behind the process - what is the
sludge?

* Is the sludge inevitable? Tim's book doesn't mention this. Clearly,
its a costly technique if the toner can only be used on a one-shot
basis, and I'm very reluctant to try the similar bleach-and-gold-tone
process for obvious reasons!

I've had some fair results fixing after the bleach and then toning, but
Tim's book doesn't mention a fixing stage. I'm aware that Tim is on the
list - could he (or anyone else who has experimented with this
technique) clarify?

Many thanks

Guy

I hate to just repeat rumors, but I have had people tell me that the
ionizers charge the dust so that it gloms onto your negatives with a
vengeance. (A prior poster suggested the wall was the destination of
choice.)

Proof of the pudding etc, I don't turn my air cleaner/ioniser off and I have 
the results of its effectiveness before me every time I get into the 
darkroom.  Incidentally, the Bionair is not just an ioniser it basically is a 
ruddy great big air cleaner that sucks the air through a large charcoal 
filter and then ionisers the scrubbed air on its return to the room.  I'm not 
at all sure that an ioniser on its own would be that beneficial!

Cheers

Aha.  Sounds like the Bionair is more like a HEPA filter. With maybe
some ionizer thingee too.

  I turn
the Honeywell device off while I work
because it is otherwise too much noise
and too much air flow for comfort.  It is a big cylindrical
appliance intended for a much larger room...

Graham,

The original publication was called the "Silverprint Manual" after the
Silverprint business which Martin Reed set up... and which he still owns and
runs in London supplying photographic and archival materials. It was first
published in 1990 as a loose-leaf binder and the plan was for subscribers
(at 12 a year) to receive additional technical supplements at regular
intervals. I bought the original package, but as far as I know, no
supplements were ever issued until...

In Spring 1991 a 32-page "Silverprint Magazine" was issued... which by issue
#2 in Summer 1991 had become "Ag Photographic" and contained... yup,
supplements! By issue #4 it was re-established as "Ag Photographic" as a
quality journal and it departed from the loose-leaf "supplement" format...
although it was still 4-hole punched if you wanted to strip the pages out
for your own filing system. This 4-hole punched, but perfect-bound, format
of around 112 pages continued sporadically until issue #8 when the
publishers (by then another company called "Working Books") went into
liquidation.

After a lapse of almost 2 years Eddie Ephraums, well-known UK photographer,
printer and photo book author, and one of the original owners, sold the
title and large stock of back-issues to Timothy Benn, publishers of the
British Journal of Photography (after, incidentally, offering the entire
package and publishing rights to myself - but I declined the offer for
various reasons) and it became a regular quarterly to the present day, but,
with the number of pages reduced to about 64 per issue. It is currently up
to issue #16 although has recently undergone some sort of commercial tie-in
with Ilford UK in order to combine readership of "Ag" and the Ilford
"Exposures" magazine which may have changed its publication format and
frequency late last year... the latter I am not entirely sure of because I
have been "bumped off" the press/freeby list.  8-(

The current UK price of Ag Photographic is 10 ($16.50 in your money) but
you have to pay a lot more across the pond for it... I seem to recall Steve
Simmons (publisher of View Camera) was asking around $90 per year for the
four issues mailed to USA addresses. To put that into context his View
Camera costs $6.95 in the States but is available in the UK for 6.50 (1st
class post paid) which equates to $10.75 in your flavour of money. In terms
of "production quality" and "technical content"... both Ag Photographic and
View Camera are fairly comparable (allowing, of course, for the quite
different subject matter they cover).

Hope this helps,

I've recently joined the fringes of the 4x5 (5x4?) fraternity.

I've bought an MPP monorail (A fascinating puzzle)

and a Polaroid MP4 copy camera with a Polaroid Enlarger Head,
(heavy in a literal sense)

The MP4 kit  was very cheap but appears functional.
Two questions please.

1. Any further info on the Polaroid setup would be appreciated,
    even if only for background.
2. The above-condensor heat resistant glass is missing. =20
    Any ideas for a replacement?

Thanks in advance.

If it looks good, do it.  The fix after the bleach process is essential for
this technique, although one can produce repeatable, and costly, results
with your technigue.  Actually an interesting chemical poterization (for
lack of a better phrase) occurs and can clean the upper highs to white,
and posterize the mid-tones.  Typically with the fix step added, you do
need to add some density to the pint as the image become even lighter after
both the fix and selenium baths.

Interestingly, I've always turned my air-filter off whilst printing because
I don't like any noise when I'm concentrating. I've never played music or
the wireless in my darkrooms in 35 years... and I find the fan-cooled head
of my Multigraph a distraction when it clicks in.

But to my point... I did notice that when the air-filter fan was switched
on, a vibration pattern (which I couldn't feel with my hand against the
unit) was transmitted from the stud-partition wall on which the fan was
mounted, down to the wooden floor... and into the contents of a 5-litre
bottle of water standing on the floor. It was quite alarming seeing the
surface of the water dancing around, but I guess that because the big
Durst's exposure times are so short (measured at around 0.7 secs for small
5x7 prints for example) thers's nothing to worry about concerning vibration
being transmitted to the enlarger from the remotely mounted fan. It had me
concerned though!

Apologies to all- I had to send this to the list as the private e-mail
addr. wouldn't function. JS.

Hello Fritz,

Many, many thanks for taking the time to share your technique with me. I
shall certainly be following your example. My basic requirement is to
produce a positive with the longest tonal range possible for the film in
question. I could probably get a longer scale by using something like Tri-x
or similar but grain and transparency d-min/fog level/emulsion base density
would be an issue then. The 8 stop scale you found would be perfect. The
main purpose for me is to cut out the interpos stage. I try to use 35mm as
I don't feel I should be hampered by cumbersome equipment, and I have
proved to myself I can get the (superficial) quality of a much larger
format with this film.

Now, I have one or two questions regarding your technique. I assume all
dev. times are at 20 C, does it make a time difference if the
bleach/clearing/2nd dev baths vary from this? I usually keep ALL my
solutions at 20 except for the final few rinses before the tap water wash
which is much colder. Have you tried Technidol for the 1st dev. if so what
was the dev. time and how did you agitate? Technidol, for the uninitiated
is liable to cause hernias due to its agitation requirements! What speed
did you rate your films at- I'm using 18 asa with 7 mins in technidol.

Is it possible to substitute Sod. Metabisulphite for the bisulphate in the
bleach. My supplier doesn't list the latter but the catalogue says 'see
Sodium M....'  finally I would be certain that the second developer must
have a large effect on the density of the final positive. Silver gelatine
prints for sepia toning need to be made about 1/2 stop darker as the sepia
image will never develop back to the density of the original print. I would
be tempted to use the same developer as the first for this bath but having
no experience.....

Well, I seem to have quite a few questions, once again  many thanks for
your invaluable advice- it will very soon be put into practice!

Julian Smart.

;Apologies to all- I had to send this to the list as the private e-mail
;addr. wouldn't function. JS.

Unfortunately our e-mail server goes down in flames periodically. Sorry.

;I could probably get a longer scale by using 
;something like Tri-x or similar but grain and transparency d-min/fog
level/emulsion 
;base density would be an issue then. 

I'm not so sure it would be an issue for the sake of producing an enlargened
negative for contact prining.  As long as all the information is on the film
and the increase in background density didn't end up blocking your
highlights up, you should be able to print through a little extra density in
the shadow areas.

;Now, I have one or two questions regarding your technique. I assume all
;dev. times are at 20 C, does it make a time difference if the
;bleach/clearing/2nd dev baths vary from this? 

I hold everything at 20 deg C and strictly observe my times and agitation (I
agitate for 5 seconds every minute by inversion in this protocol).  My wash
water is also regulated at 20 deg C.  I wouldnt vary my other solutions
wildly from this, but room temp is close enough to 20 deg for the bleach and
clear to work properly.

; Have you tried Technidol for the 1st dev. if so what was the dev. time and
how did ;you agitate? Technidol, for the uninitiated is liable to cause
hernias due to its ;agitation requirements! What speed did you rate your
films at- I'm using 18 asa with 7 ;mins in technidol.

I haven't tried technidol as a first developer, but do use it for developing
negatives.  I expose at 25 and bracket 1/2 stop over and process for 7
minutes so it looks like we are doing about the same.  I agitate differently
than Kodak recommends, though.  I do their big shake and dance when I first
put the film in the developer, but after that I agitate by twisting the
developing can back and forth while it rests in the sink.  I do this
relatively gently but vigorous enough to get some currents flowing in the
developer.  This limited agitation may be giving me a little bit of
compensating action in my developer because of exhaustion in the highlights.
I have never gotten surge marks or uneven development agitating this way.

;Is it possible to substitute Sod. Metabisulphite for the bisulphate in the
;bleach. 

Metabisulfite is not the same as bisulfate so I dont know if you could
substitute or not.  I get my bisulfate from the Photographers Formulary.
It's cheap.  If you need to go another route,  some recipes use sulfuric
acid instead of bisultate.  The sulfuric acid or bisulfate are there to drop
the pH of the solution.  I went with bisulfate because it is a relatively
innocuous solid whereas sulfuric acid is a liquid and spills are more of a
pain in the butt.  As an example recipe, Hans Deitrich's 1988 article used
9.5 grams potasium dichromate plus 12 ml concentrated sulfuric acid in 1
liter total volume as his bleach.  Use the same as in my protocol.

;finally I would be certain that the second developer must have a large
effect on the ;density of the final positive. 

Nope.  The first developer controls everything.  The re-exposure and second
developer need to go to completion.  The positive image is made up of all
the silver that is left over after the first developer so you control
density and contrast by twiddling with the first developer.


;Silver gelatine prints for sepia toning need to be made about 1/2 stop
darker 
;as the sepia image will never develop back to the density of the original 
;print. I would be tempted to use the same developer as the first for this 
;bath but having no experience.....

I haven't fully sepia toned any of my transparencies but have done the
sulfide in the second developer for a slight toning effect.  For fully sepia
toning, I would either under expose a half stop or so, or would underdevelop
in the first developer to get the increased density.  You would have to
experiment to come up with the best developer time or exposure compensation.

;Well, I seem to have quite a few questions, once again  many thanks for
;your invaluable advice- it will very soon be put into practice!

Glad to help.  Let me know how you successes go.

As another chronic asthisma sufferer, I will tell you that HEPA is a type of
filter, they not only remove dust from the air they remove smaller
particles, smells and smoke.  Most newer air filters use a combination of
HEPA filter with an Ionizer, the Ionizer gets the particles to clump togeter
and this makes the filter more effective.

     If you have any problems, suggestions, or questions, please contact
     the maintainer, Cees de Groot <mailto:cg@pobox.com>.
  1.1.  I don't have access to the Web

  ``You're pointing to Websites everywhere, but I don't have access to
  the WWW.'' Sorry, but I think that you are out of luck. To put it
  bluntly, I feel that if you can afford to put time and money into
  photography, you should be able to put time and money into the
  greatest information resource on photography - the Web. Furthermore,
  people expect you to have access to the Web, so they will respond
  irritated if you ask questions on the newsgroup that are one click
  away from this FAQ.

  So do yourself a favour, and get a decent Internet account.

  2.  General information


  2.1.  What is rec.photo.darkroom all about?

  Darkroom work. In the broadest sense. There are people here trying to
  get started with developing 35mm film, people busy with alternative
  processes, professional darkroom workers, etcetera. There are many
  many topics which are discussed: materials, technique, equipment,
  etcetera. There are some questions, however, which are better
  discussed in other groups, like the quality of films
  (rec.photo.film+labs) and buying/selling equipment
  (rec.photo.marketplace).

  Here's the newsgroups line and the charter of rec.photo.darkroom:

       rec.photo.darkroom Developing, printing and other darkroom
       issues

       This newsgroup will contain postings related to all aspects
       of photographic darkroom use. As such it will cover subjects
       such as the developing of slide and negative film,
       photographic printing from negatives and slides,
       photographic toning processes and alternative chemistry.
       This newsgroup specifically does *NOT* permit the posting of
       commercial advertisments for products or services, even if
  they are related to photography.


  By the way, all the charters for the rec.photo groups are available on
  Photo.net.  Read them, before you post...


  2.2.  What is The Link?

  I'm going to introduce a new saying on the rec.photo newsgroups: Use
  The Link, Luke ;-).

  The Link is The Guide to rec.photo FAQs
  <http://www4.ncsu.edu/unity/users/j/jnweg/faq44.htm>, and is simply a
  huge collection of pointers to other places. If you have any interest
  in photography, you should definitely bookmark this place.


  2.3.  Your Mileage May Vary?

  ``YMMV'' is a well-known Usenetism to indicate that what works for me,
  may not work for you. This is especially true in photography. Although
  all photographic processes are subject to the laws of physics and
  chemistry, there is such a large variation of factors you need to take
  into account that it is impossible to say how something will work out
  exactly in somebody else's darkroom. Add to that personal preferences
  - what I call fine grain is horrible, golf-ball grain to the next guy
  - and you'll understand that the only way to find out is to
  experiment.

  Especially questions containing the words ``will ... make a
  difference?''  are subject to this: probably, somebody with a well-
  equipped lab having access to advanced measuring instruments will
  always find a difference. But this does not matter. What matters, is
  whether you will see a difference. So, rather than ask the Net, you
  might as well see for yourself, because you're likely to get vague
  answers anyway.

  Test And Experiment, you can only learn from it.


  3.  The darkroom


  3.1.  How do I build a darkroom?

  There's an awful lot to say here, and it is all very dependent on what
  kind of space (big/small, permanent/nonpermanent) you have. Kodak has
  a lot of good, sound advice on darkroom building, and I'm aware of one
  links covering the topic:

  o  http://www.darkroomsource.com



  3.2.  Can I use tapwater for ...?

  Generally speaking: yes you can. The short answer comes from David
  Manzi <mailto:dman3@mediaone.net>, I quote:







  Could you use it from a tap?
  Yes you could, you little sap!
  Could you use it for a mix?
  Sure you could, without a fix!
  Can I use it for a wash?
  Absolutely, let is slosh!
  But what about photo-flo?
  Ooo I'm sorry, that's a no.



  The general consensus is that normal tapwater doesn't contain any
  chemicals in high enough concentrations to influence photographic
  processes. This is assuming we are talking about water from a water
  company - well water may very well be unsuitable for darkroom work.
  The only exception is the final rinse with wetting agent (Photo Flo),
  where hard water may still leave drying marks; here it makes sense to
  use distilled water, water from an air dehumidifier, or bottled water
  (if it is soft enough).

  This is only a general consensus, people have been complaining about
  their tap water's fitness for darkroom work. If you feel uncertain,
  you might want to consult others in the area (minilabs), your water
  company, etcetera.


  3.3.  How do I store chemicals?

  A discussion that is coming up over and over again is what kind of
  bottles are best used to store chemicals. The best stuff, but you
  already knew that, is dark brown glass bottles with stops made for
  keeping chemicals in and air out. Glass doesn't let air through and is
  easy to clean, and these are the two most important considerations
  (brown glass also doesn't let light in that could harm your
  chemicals). These bottles are also the most expensive ones, so you
  might want to use them only for chemicals that oxidize easily, like
  developer.

  Plastics are permeable to air, and not as easy to clean (chemicals can
  and will be absorbed by plastic and it'll never get out). The cleaning
  part is solved mostly by only using any given container for a single
  type of solution. How much oxygen can get to your chemicals depends on
  the type of plastic and its thickness (the thicker, the better). The
  best solution is metalized plastic, then PETE, HDPE, LDPE, PP, PVC, PS
  and last and worst Teflon. Here's an overview of plastics names, the
  numbers that appear inside the "recycling triangle" on containers from
  these materials, and what they're often used for:


  1     Polyethylene terepthalate (PETE)       soft drink bottles
  2     High Density Polyethylene (HDPE)       milk, juice and laundry product bottles, Nalgene laboratory ware and bottles
  3     Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)               cooking oil, water, vinegar and bleach bottles
  4     Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE)        bags, margarine and ice containers
  5     Polypropylene (PP)                     yogurt cups and ketchup and syrup bottles
  6     Polystyrene (PS)                       clear: salad containers, disposable cups; expanded: insulating food containers
  -     (Poly)tetrafluoroethylene ((P)TFE)     Dupont Trademark "Teflon"; laboratory and environmental sampling containers



  (table and most of the information in this section from a posting by
  Marc Hult <mailto:hult@cinternet.net> in rec.photo.darkroom, Message
  ID <35545554.231656@news.one.net>).




  3.4.  How do I remove water marks?

  A recipe by Richard Knoppow <mailto:dickburk@ix.netcom.com>, found in
  rec.photo.darkoom:

  "Try the following.  Soak the film for a few minutes in plain water,
  then treat it for a couple of minutes in stop bath. Swab the surface
  gently with cotton swabs.  If there is anything left treat it with a
  wash aid like Kodak Hypo Clearing Agent for a minute or two and again
  try swabbing.  This should remove any deposits left by the Photo-Flo.
  Then wash the film for five minutes and treat in a mixture of
  distilled water with about one ounce per quart of rubbing alcohol
  added (Mike Gudzinowicz correct this if wrong) and about half the
  amount of Photo-Flow recommended by Kodak.  Hang it up to dry without
  further swabbing."


  3.5.  How do I get rid of my old chemicals?

  This depends on your local circumstances. If you're connected to a
  sewage treatment plant, just down the drain with it. The stuff you
  produce day by day on the toilet puts more load on the system than the
  relatively small amounts of waste chemicals you collect in your
  darkroom. It's more hazardous, too, to collect and store large amounts
  of processed chemicals in order to bring them to a depot (if you have
  one in your area). If you're unsure whether you're allowed to do this
  (regulations may vary), contact the guys who process your water - I'm
  sure they'll be more than happy to give advice.

  People have reported no problems dumping chemicals into their septic
  tank system, although some take the precaution to dump them together
  with large volumes of water, eg. when the washing machine pumps its
  water out. If you are not sure your septic tank will survive
  photochemicals, contact your dealer (at the very least, you've got
  somebody to sue :-)).

  If you cannot or don't want to dump chemicals down the drain, an
  often-heard advise is to collect it in a large cannister which you
  leave open in order to have the water evaporate. You can then
  regularly collect the crystals from the cannister and get rid of them
  in whatever way you get rid of other dry chemical waste (which all
  depends on local regulations). Take precautions against spilling or
  leakage, like storing the cannister in a tray that can hold the volume
  of fluid in the cannister.

  Note that all these rules apply to hobby darkrooms only. If you're a
  professional, you should contact your local environmental authority
  and talk to them; most places have strict rules about chemical storage
  and disposal for professionally-run darkrooms and photolabs.



  3.6.  What's the difference between the various enlarger types?

  There are two main types of enlargers: diffusion and condensor
  enlargers. The difference is in the type of light that hits the film:
  a diffusion enlarger has a light mixing chamber and/or a diffuse
  translucent panel in order to shed an evenly distributed, diffuse
  light onto the negative. A condensor enlarger uses one or more lens
  elements in order to produce a colliminated light beam focused on the
  negative.

  You cannot say that one type is better than the other - a lot of
  photographers have taken foot in one camp and defend their type of
  enlarger in an almost religous way, but you will be able to produce
  good prints with both.
  There are some objective differences due to the nature of the light:

  o  The specular light from the condensor enlarger tends to enhance
     dust, etcetera, on the negative. You need to be more careful, but
     it's not a very big deal. A condensor enlarger also tends to show
     more grain in the print, but see the next point. On the other hand,
     the images are a bit sharper, which makes them especially popular
     for small formats like 35mm.

  o  The specular light also gives higher contrast. This is hard to
     explain in just a few words, but it's a well-known effect
     discovered by a Mr. Callier in the early days of this century:
     specular light gives higher density readings than diffuse light,
     and the ratio between these density readings is called the Callier
     Coefficient. I won't go into the details, but it means you need to
     shorten your development times in order to correct for this effect.
     Shorter development gives smaller grains and this offsets the
     higher grain from the previous point.

  o  Again due to the Callier effect, you will have a difference in
     contrast between contact prints and enlarged prints with a
     condensor enlarger: contact prints always show the diffuse
     densities in your negative, condensor enlarged prints show the
     higher specular densities. If you make a contact sheet, you will
     usually need a higher paper grade for this contact sheet in order
     to see the effect you'll get when enlarging the negatives. This is
     not a very big deal - you can match paper grades quite easily (it's
     normally one grade difference), and for good prints the grade
     indicated by a contact print is just a starting point, anyway
     (Ansel Adams used a very soft grade for his contact sheets in order
     to get maximal information, thus completely bypassing this
     problem).


  4.  Film processing


  4.1.  How do I process...

  Did you check the manufacturer information? I don't mean the stuff
  printed on the inside of the box, but the full information readily
  available on the web or even as hardcopy? When starting with a new
  film/developer combination, make sure that you get and read the
  manufacturer datasheets of both developer and film first - most of the
  manufacturers have datasheets available on the Web:

  o  Kodak <http://www.kodak.com/ciHome/products/L1/>, or call
     1-800-242-2424 ext. 19 if you are in the US;

  o  Agfa <http://www.agfaphoto.com/products/index.html>;

  o  Ilford <http://www.ilford.com/html/us_english/homeng.html>;

  o  Fuji <http://www.fujifilm.com/>.

     Then, there is an incredible amount of information about processing
     film on the web maintained by individuals. A (very) short list:

  o  Photo Source
     <http://www.users.dircon.co.uk/~migol/photo/photosource.html>, with
     the Massive B&W Dev Chart, a gigantic list of development times for
     a lot of film/developer combinations.

     and of course: Use The Link, Luke.


  4.2.  My Kodak Tmax film comes out purple - what happened?

  Tmax (and other T-grain films like Ilford Delta) have sensitizing dies
  incorporated into the emulsion that cannot be washed out very easily.
  If you don't follow processing instructions carefully, this
  sensitizing dye gives a purple/pink/magenta hue. According to Kodak, a
  slight hue doesn't influence printing, but if the color is stronger,
  it adds to base+fog density.

  First of all, get Kodak datasheet F-32. Via the Web (see above) or
  from your photographic dealer. If you read the instructions carefully
  and follow them, you won't have any problems. In a few words, you need
  to dump your fixer earlier (because these emulsions exhaust them
  faster), agitate vigourously when fixing, wash a bit longer, and use
  Hypo Clearing Agent. As this is FAQ number one on the group, I'll just
  quote F-32:

       "Fix at 65 to 75F (18C to 24C) for 3 to 5 minutes with vig-
       orous agitation in KODAK Rapid Fixer. Be sure to agitate the
       film frequently during fixing.

       "Note: To keep fixing times as short as possible, we
       strongly recommend using KODAK Rapid Fixer. If you use
       another fixer, such as KODAK Fixer or KODAFIX solution, fix
       for 5 to 10 minutes or twice the time it takes for the film
       to clear. You can check the film for clearing after 3
       minutes in KODAK Rapid Fixer or 5 minutes in KODAK Fixer or
       KODAFIX Solution.

       "Important: Your fixer will be exhausted more rapidly with
       these films than with other films. If your negatives show a
       magenta (pink) stain after fixing, your fixer may be near
       exhaustion, or you may not have used a long enough time.  If
       the stain is slight, it will not affect negative contrast or
       printing times.  If pronounced and irregular over the film
       surface, refix the film in fresh fixer.

       "Wash for 20 to 30 minutes in running water at 65F to 75F
       (18C to 24C) with a flow ratre that provides at least one
       complete change of water in 5 minutes.  You can wash long
       rolls on the processing reel. To save time and conserve
       water, use KODAK Hypo Clearing Agent."


  The Ilford datasheets for Delta films have similar instructions.  If
  you have films with these residual dies in them, re-fixing followed by
  a long wash may help.


  5.  What's the advantage of diluting developer?

  When you dilute developer, you change the chemical characteristics of
  the various components. The two effects most cited are that you get
  better sharpness, but at the same time slightly larger grain - both
  caused by the suppression of silver solvent action. You also can gain
  a bit more speed, and because of the extended developing times, it is
  easier to get even and consistent development. Dilute developer makes
  it economical to use it one-shot (throw it away after usage), which
  further adds to consistency.

  In howfar the effects of dilute developer are visible, depends on the
  film/developer combination. When starting out with a new combo, test
  various dilutions and see whether you can make out any differences.
  Use what you like best.


  6.  Printing


  6.1.  Resin-coated of Fiber-based paper?

  Which one you will use depends on a lot of things. First, the facts:

  o  FB paper has proven archival qualities (given proper processing).
     That's why collectors, musea, etc. often insist on FB.

  o  RC paper has shown good keeping qualities in accellerated aging
     tests.  If it is just for yourself, friends and family, I think you
     can rest assured that it will keep the rest of your life. But,
     until RC paper has been on the market for another 100 years, it's
     not called archival.

  o  RC paper is much easier to process. It is especially easy to wash
     and dry, and it won't curl.

  o  FB paper is less sensitive to the temperatures in a dry-mount
     press.

  o  FB paper can be kept wet for a very long time, whereas with RC
     paper, you risk separation of the layers.

     Then the opinions: there are people who simply like the look and
     feel of FB paper better. You should decide that for yourself, of
     course. Invest in a small package of both, that will give you a
     better answer than asking the newsgroup.


  6.2.  Can I use brand A VC filters on brand B paper?

  Yes, but there might be small differences in the grades you get.
  However, a #2 filter will always give a softer result as a #3 filter,
  no matter on which paper you use it.

  My humble opinion: the subtle differences of mixing up filters and
  papers are probably smaller than the differences introduced by the
  fact that you probably use another developer, enlarger and darkroom
  than the factory test facility. So you need to test anyway (I test by
  contact printing a step tablet).


  6.3.  I have a color head, can I print on VC paper?

  Yes, you can. Again, get the datasheets of the paper - manufacturers
  of VC paper normally have color filtration values for the various
  grades. A starting point:

                         Grade 2       45M/9Y
                         Grade 2.5     65M/12Y
                         Grade 3       95M/15Y
                         Grade 3.5     120M/20Y
                         Grade 4       200M/30Y
                         Grade 5+      200M



  6.4.  Can I print color negatives on black-and-white paper?

  Yes, you can. Normal B&W paper, however, is not panchromatic - it only
  responds to a narrow band of wavelengths of light. Graded paper just
  responds to blue light, and variable contrast paper responds to blue
  and green light (but the amounts of blue and green light influence the
  gradation of the paper). Generally speaking, printing color negs on
  B&W paper won't give natural-looking results.

  Kodak has a panchromatic paper, Panalure, available in 3 grades. If
  you want to get good results printing from color negatives, you should
  use this paper.

  Of course, using normal B&W paper can give interesting effects,
  comparable with using orthochromatic film - experiment!

Are the shadows there for me to find, or placed there by my searching mind.
When I reach and find them gone, was I right or was I wrong?

Many of them do produce ozone, which is why some advise asthmatics not to 
use them (ozone can inflame lung tissue in some people).

An ioniser reputedly takes three days to work effectively in a room - no
point switching it off and on.

I am a newcomer to pure-silver so maybe I should give a quick introduction.
Having photographed in monochrome pretty well all my life of 50+ years, I
have run the Fine Print Photographers Workshop here on the Welsh/English
border for over 10 years as a professional print/process service. I also
coach photographers one-to-one here. I wrote a book, 'Elements', about fine
monochrome photography in 1993, and have another, 'Edge of Darkness' due for
publication in a couple of months from the same publisher as Tim Rudman's
excellent lith printing guide. I also write for Ed Buziak's magazine, and Ag
(used to be Ag+) magazine. Also, I am the guy who launched DiXactol
tanning/staining developer last year. OK, enough (in fact, probably too
much) about me.
I think I am the person who inadvertently started the recent discussion on
negative ionisers, since Saffron Branfoot who originally raised it, had just
been to my workshop where I showed her one in use.
I have used one since the middle 1980s at home where it aids easy
breathing - I suffer from very slight asthma. It also simply makes you feel
better. Something nice to have in the darkroom anyway. I can confirm the
effect on walls beneath the ioniser; you can see the fall of dust that it
causes as the wall steadily blackens! Tip - fasten a piece of occasionally
disposable paper to the wall beneath it.
However, this is not the real way the ioniser is used in darkroom terms. It
has another very useful effect - it kills static. If you damp the back of
your hand and hold in front of the unit, you can feel the cool flow of ions.
There is no need to leave the ioniser on for long periods in the darkroom to
have a clean negative effect (though it does give a pleasanter atmosphere
and costs virtually nothing to run). All we need to do is to switch it on
when we are loading a negative into the carrier. Then hold the negative,
turning both faces towards the ioniser alternately,  a couple of inches in
front of the unit for a few seconds. The dust just seems to fall off. My
regime used to be to tap the edge of the neg on the bench top (this also
tends to dispel static) and wipe with a special carbon fibre brush - in my
case the 'Static Whisk' from Kinetronics.
In practice, using the ioniser meant that I no longer needed to tap the neg
or wipe it with a brush. From force of habit I still wipe the back of the
negative with the back of my somewhat hairy hand.
In the early 90s I rolled all these methods into one when I bought a
Dust-Stat from ProCo here in the UK. This is an ioniser with two vertically
opposed carbon fibre brushes mounted above. Passing a negative between the
brushes automatically puts it through the ion stream. It is totally
effective and trouble free. However, its remote transformer box is bulky and
heavy, and the flying lead to the ioniser head too thick and inflexible for
easy positioning of the unit on the bench top. It was pricey too. I believe
they have updated the unit since though.
One thing it doesn't deal with is static in the anti-Newton's ring glass on
the lower surface of the condenser of my Leitz Focomat 1c enlarger. I have
no trouble with the neg. carrier glasses of any other of my enlargers, but
this glass seems to charge itself up like an electromagnet for dust. Any
ideas anybody?

An ioniser reputedly takes three days to work effectively in a room - no
point switching it off and on.

Widow of Ansel Adams Dies


CARMEL, Calif. (AP) - Virginia Best Adams, the widow of master nature
photographer Ansel Adams, has died at the age of 96.

Mrs. Adams, also the manager of Best's art gallery in Yosemite for some 30
years, died Jan. 29 in this coastal community where she had lived since 1962.

The daughter of artist Harry Cassie Best and Annie Rippey Best, Mrs. Adams
spent her childhood in California's Yosemite Valley. She met her future
husband when he came to her family's home to practice piano. They married
at her father's studio in 1928.

Mrs. Adams performed as a singer and was on the board of directors of the
Sierra Club for many years.

She took over management of Best's studio when her father died in 1936.
It's now known as the Ansel Adams Gallery and showcases the work of a
number of artists and painters.

``My mother loved, admired and participated in Ansel's endeavors, but she
was also a strong person in her own quiet way,'' said daughter Anne Adams
Helms. ``She raised us almost single-handedly and kept the proverbial home
fires burning, which enabled Ansel to concentrate his full time and energy
on his photography and writing.''

Ansel Adams, noted for his striking black-and-white photographs of Yosemite
and other subjects, died in 1984 at the age of 82. Copyright 2000

Like a number of techniques, I found this by serendipity having bleached
back a print that was too dark, before toning I was surprised to see it
darken again in the selenium. The print was then too dark again but did lead
to some fruitful experimentation. As I said in the book, this is a variable
technique that works (or not) differently with different papers.
KRST contains a lot of amm. thiosulphate so it is surprising that it works
with any and you may find it better with old used solutions - or with the
Kodak T-55 formula which contains no hypo, but this entails home mixing with
selenium powder which is toxic. ( The old Kodak formula book of 1975
describes it as 'irritant' but this is probably a significant
understatement! ). The sludge is not important and settles  to the bottom
allowing you to decant the clear solution off. It doesn't normally cuase
staining in my experience if the print has been adequately fresh fixed and
washed.
You will not get this sludge with Gold toner so don't worry. Personally I
think this works best with gold and especially on Sterling (now Fotospeed)
RCVC and FBVC - an emulsion which responds particularly well to various
bleach/redev techniques.
This is an area ripe for further research as emulsions vary so very much in
this respect, and even more so when different bleaches are used. The
permutations are almost endless with the new and the altered emulsions of
the last 2 years. It's an area I am interested in. but time is the old enemy
as always. I would be very interested to hear from others who do work in
this area.

I haven't tried the Ilford cloth (indeed didn't know they sold one), but
have tried others with only temporary success. Earthing the enlarger makes
sense to me. I'll give it a try. Thanks.

Hello All,

I have been lith printing since the start of the year now and have made
some observations on the technical and aesthetic aspects that I would like
to share with you. I'm not trying to brag, but some may find my
observations of interest.

Materials: Forte Bromofort, Kodalith liquid concentrate- at least 10 years
old 100ml A+ 100Ml B in 4L water at 20C, printing almost exclusively 35mm
Tech. Pan. on DeVere 504 MG head set to g1.5, Rodagon 50mm, no safelight
except for last 5 mins, Kodak unifix at 1:4, acid stop. Old Brown 100ml-
from 1st session - throughput of 4 16*8 prints and left to oxidise for 2
days.

I am getting consistent and repeatable results by processing 2 prints,
replenishing with 100 Ml A+ 100Ml B then processing another 2 prints before
starting with a totally fresh mix. My dev. times are almost always between
13 and 15 minutes and the colours I get are almost always a cold reddish
beige with slightly cooler shadows. Chemical/pepper fogging is not a
problem though I do get  some random black spots if the developer is pushed
too far. The paper needs to be handled very carefully as finger prints will
develop up fully and stand out a mile- I use cotton gloves.  

Technically I have found that the Tech. Pan. film gives best results when
the highlight density is not too great- here a half stop over can only
result in washed out highlights in the print. I've found it almost
impossible to get great print density here and I suspect that, as with
other non-standard printing techniques, the negative really has to suit the
process with which it is to be printed. The lack of highlight density does
not really bother me as the tones are smooth and the required information
is there- it's the contrast in the highlight regions I would like to
expand.
My printing exposure is a cause for concern, being 4-6 minutes at f4/4.5
which doesn't allow me to get the best from the lens/enlarger but as with
my above statement I will be shooting specifically to lith print and will
knock a minute or so off my Technidol times so should get a more suitable
neg. I feel that it could be difficult to lith print a clients neg. unless
it looks about right for the process...

I have tried split toning this paper in Thio. and Selenium as well as both
individually. They all go much the same way..sepia, and the result is not
really worth it for the colour alone. I intend to try one of the more pink
papers such as Art Classic to get my sought after pink/blue split in
Selenium.

This led me on to thinking about the issue of pre-visualisation of which I
am a great believer.
If the photographer can pre-visualise his final print and a consistent 
film processing method is evolved, it should be possible to  harness some
of the zone system workers methods for production of the lith print.
It would be interesting to do a series of step wedge tests on film and then
transfer them to a lith print to see the effects of N+1/N-1 film
development etc. Snatch point on the lith test would be for a pure black
zone 0, keeping an exposure that printed to the whitest Zone 10 (or
above?). The curves generated would probably look like spaghetti junction
though!

Overall then, lith printing has given me great freedom to express,
harnesses a creamy tonal range in the highlights, prints with a dark
graphic undertone and beautiful colour scheme. My Holy Grail.

Any comments/suggestions most welcome,

Julian Smart.
Oxford, U.K.

Tim,

Thanks for your reply. Since I don't fancy mixing my own T-55 formula
(selenium powder is pretty nasty, as you say) are you aware of any other
commercial selenium solutions which do not contain hypo?

Thanks

Guy

Are there any examples of the lith process on the web, for those of us
who don't know what it look a like?

Hello everyone !

I've been reading the list for a couple of weeks now and have found the
various exchanges most interesting. I am also keen on lith printing (as well
as most other things mono) and like many others I wish to  improve my lith
work. 

I would welcome any feedback you may have on the following query: 

Currently I am using the powder form of Kodak's lith developer as it is very
cost effective in the quantities I need. I have also briefly used a UK made
propriety liquid lith developer ( available in 500 ml size only ) and  the
Kodak powder developer seems much slower in comparison, although I have
found it it does work well. I have also heard much praise about the Kodak
liquid lith developer and I am thinking about ordering this next time I need
to replenish my stock,  as it seems to be a totally different developer (not
merely a liquid form of the powder formulation).  

Can anyone advise on this and on lith developers in general ? 

BTW: I do have Tim's excellent lith printing book but I have heard
conflicting advice on these two Kodak lith developers. This is all very
confusing ! 

Many thanks,

Neil Souch,

No. All the ones here do (AFAIK)
The gold option can be nicer.
The Se one looks a bit like a lith print - but a lith print has the edge
anyway.

What conflicting advice have you heard?
They all work pretty well. You are right that the 2 kodak devs are quite
different, but in practice it doesn't matter too much. The liquid version is
good - but expensive if you don't use much. In time you will find it peaks
and 'goes over' rather quicker than say LD20/Novolith
I wouldn't worry too much about the differences until you get moderately
expert at it (which you may well be of course)

Looks like you have got it pretty much under control. When you try Art
Classic et al. you will find that the brightness of the colours are much
influenced by snatch point (i.e. grain size) and pulling what looks like too
early will give a light pink print with too low contrast, but the visual
contrast comes when the colours separate out in selenium. Pulling later
gives more subdued colurs and a more limited range of colours.

Re. consistency, I find that a big dish helps as I can get 8 litres in a
20x24. I move the prints in it rather than rock the dish, this avoids
spillage.

Neil,

I have a friend who started his lith printing around the same time as me-
we shared the same box of paper. He bought the Kodak powder and got good
but not particularly 'lithy' results from it, said it quickly went off and
was a pain to mix. I have only ever used the Kodalith liquid- I found a
stash of it left over from our graphic arts film days in the lab. It's
probably ten years old but still worked perfectly on  film to give a pure
lith result, so I figured it would work for paper as well. I simply
replenish after 2 prints, process two more then ditch it. I get very
consistent results. Further replenishment only leads to random black spots,
strange black streaks and long development times without any added lith
benefit (and without additives, that is).
The way I look at it is that changing your developer adds another major
variable which needs to be fully explored to gain any benefit, with a
corresponding drain on time and money. I tend to thrash a process to death,
then start exploring other avenues.

I do believe the Kodalith liquid dev. is expensive to buy as a concentrate,
but at the dilutions we use is perhaps very economical. Also how many stock
solutions of, say D76 or Xtol will be useable in ten years time. :~)

Hope this is of any help,
Happy printing,

Dear Tim,

Many thanks for your reply.

Re: Kodak lith devs - what conflicting advice ... 

Basically, some tell me it is the same and others disagree. I've only used
the powdered variety but from conversations I've had with users of the
liquid dev I've had  a gut feeling for a while  they can't be the same. I've
used LD20 with some success but the 500 ml size limitation is a pain. I do
get through the stuff once I get going. From my experience the Kodak powder
dev feels tame in comparison to LD20 and I have to use it at quite high
concentrations to get a good lith effect. Thanks for confirming the two
Kodaks  are in fact different ! 

All the best,

Neil.

What conflicting advice have you heard?
They all work pretty well. You are right that the 2 kodak devs are quite
different, but in practice it doesn't matter too much. The liquid version is
good - but expensive if you don't use much. In time you will find it peaks
and 'goes over' rather quicker than say LD20/Novolith
I wouldn't worry too much about the differences until you get moderately
expert at it (which you may well be of course)
Tim

Julian,

Your friend's experience with the Kodak powder lith dev matches mine exactly.
Nice to know this ! Tim has now confirmed that the two devs are different,
but both can give good results.  Personally, I would like to get back to 
using something like LD20 when I next buy in dev. I think I was more
consistent with that dev. I guess the other lith devs are much the same (
the liquid ones ) and it is the Kodak powder that is  has a noticeable
different character. I hadn't really thought of the dev going off  so
quickly and I'm sure that is why it is tame most of the time! 

I aim to be lithing for  along time to come (keeping everything crossed) so
I think I will go for the Kodak liquid next time ( even at the cost) as the
shelf life does seem exceptional.

Many thanks for your advice - most helpful.

Neil.

Tim,

thanks for the advice. My next move is to get hold of some Art Classic or
Kentona and try and achieve some pink/blue prints.After that, Ilford MG WT.
 
I get the consistency I need by using 20*24" trays and find that 4L of
developer is enough. Would using 8L give me a better throughput or would it
 oxidise just as fast? I'm really not sure how aerial oxidation would
affect my results on Bromoforte.

I am writing this as I had a sudden idea  that someone on the list might be 
able to help me with a search, which to date has lead nowhere.  I am an 
admirer of Imogen Cunningham and am collecting books about her work etc, and 
heard that a video called 'Portrait of Imogen' had been made by Meg Partridge 
in 1988. I tried to get it from 'Pacific Pictures'  CA,  but have been told 
that it is out of print. Does anyone know of this video (or any other made 
about her ) and have any idea where I can track one down. I would  appreciate 
any help, as it would mean so much to me to see it, and hear her own comments 
about her work. thanks --I live in hope !Saffron Branfoot

I've been following the lith developer discussions with interest.

A couple of bits which may be of interest to mixers, dabblers and =
amateur alchemists.

For Brits,  The "RAYCO REVEALS" book, page 40 lists a 2 part formula =
which looks
                interesting.  Costs look reasonable.
                "RAYCO FORMULAE BOOK" page 13 lists a single bath =
formula

For all.    Web search for                 Amateur Photographic Science
               or                                  =
http//bjornburton.org/formulary.html
               then look at                     Ansco formulae (Search =
for lith)

The obvious nasty is Paraformaldehyde (in all formulae)

If anyone has any further info, then I (and I'm sure others) would love =
to hear.

When I have time, I'll buy and try.

Hello,

Does anyone have any experience using developers other than Ilfords own in
an Ilfospeed processor.
Would love to hear any opinions regarding quality, cost or stability.

Thanks in advance,
Julian Smart.

I have been shooting b&w for a few years, and up to this point I have never 
used a presoak for the film.  But a few days ago I decided to try it one 
time.  The first time I tried.  I put in the water... I had intended to soak 
for a minute or so, but I got sidetracked and it was probably closer to 4 or 
5 min.  When I dumped the water, it was a kind of dark purple color.  I was 
worried that something had gone wrong, but I developed the film anyway.  The 
negs look ok, but I haven't been able to do any printing with them yet, so I 
can't say for sure.  I tried it again, and this time I didn't get 
distracted.. I managed to stick to one minute, and the water still came out 
purple.

Could this be the anti halation layer washing off?  BTW I'm using Ilford 
Delta 100.  And I'm using distilled water for the presoak.  If this is the 
case why doesn't this happen when I just go straight to the develper?  Can 
this water be used again for presoak?  Or do I have to dump it and use fresh 
every time?

Actually I'm not real clear on the benefits of presoaking.  Looking at the 
negs, I don't really notice any difference.  But since (as I stated before) I 
haven't been able to print them, so I can't really comment on that.

Any help would be appreciated.

Hi Dean and group -

You won't do any harm at all with the pre-soak.  It may be uneccesary, but
not harmful.  It is, indeed, the anti-halation that's coming off the film.
Actually, you've given me a good idea:  I'm going to try a presoak with DMAX
400 (Freestyle's private-label Delta Pro 400) to see if it doesn't reduce
the magenta cast in the negatives.

  The color in the presoak water is just antihalation dye; don't worry
about it.
  Barry Sinclair of Ilford said that the reason Ilford recommends against a
presoak is that the emulsions contain a wetting agent that's intended to
promote evenness etc., and that the use of a presoak can actually cause the
unevenness that it's intended to prevent.
  Personally I've never noticed or measured any difference between the use
of a short presoak or not using it, so the only time I do use a presoak is
when it's necessary in order to avoid airbells such as when using a rotary
processor.

Well.. actually no.  This was a little bit more like satisfying some 
curiosity.  I had heard about it many times and was wondering if there was 
any real difference.

Honestly though, I have been considering giving Pyro a try.

I recommend presoak for use with my Di Xactol developer. I accept Ilford's
point, but not all films have wetting agent additives, and I have also found
it does help prevent airbells. That is not the main reason I use it however.
The main reason is that it tempers the tank. It is surprising how many
people go to immense trouble to achieve the precise temperature for the
developer, then pour it in to a tank that is much colder than the solution
(very occasionally too warm in the UK!) Where there is a big variation in
ambient and solution temperature, I will give two or three changes of
presoak water over three or four minutes, usually while I am measuring out
the other solutions, so it takes very little extra time.
Obviously, stainless steel tanks are more prone to heat drain anyway.
The old tempering remedy of standing the tank in a water bath doesn't work.
If the outside water is higher than the interior solution, the tank just
floats and the upper tank area and lid stay cold, which affects the
developer when agitated. It also gives a wet tank which tends to run up your
sleeve when inversion agitating!

  The color in the presoak water is just antihalation dye; don't worry
about it.
  Barry Sinclair of Ilford said that the reason Ilford recommends against a
presoak is that the emulsions contain a wetting agent that's intended to
promote evenness etc., and that the use of a presoak can actually cause the
unevenness that it's intended to prevent.
  Personally I've never noticed or measured any difference between the use
of a short presoak or not using it, so the only time I do use a presoak is
when it's necessary in order to avoid airbells such as when using a rotary
processor.

Julian,

I've not tried MGWT lithed yet and haven't heard anyone else doing
so either. I have heard it is very good though in toners - esp gold.

I mainly use Kentonia and Art Classic and they go well in lith. You
will certainly get the pink / blues you seek with those papers.

All the best,

Neil Souch

AUSTIN, Texas (AP) - Fred M. Hattersley Jr., a photographer who taught
creativity and self expression and often sparked controversy with his
images, died Saturday. He was 78.

Hattersley started teaching at Rochester Institute of Photography in the
1950s before his career took him to Columbia University, the Smithsonian
and Oxford University.

His photos were often considered groundbreaking for their creativity. His
1962 photo essay ``Black and White in Color'' sparked a furor because it
depicted a nude interracial couple in a time of segregation.

Hattersley also was a longtime columnist for Popular Photography magazine
and wrote nine books, including ``Discover Yourself Through Photography.''

He is survived by three children.

While doing some thinking in the shower for photo ideas, a few came to mind.  
Real simple question, I would like to hang some objects from fishing line and 
not have it show up in the photo.  Anyone have any experience dealing with it.

Thanks,
John

One old trick is to hang the object straight above the camera so you are 
pointing the camera straight up.
Sometimes this involves building a set or background that fools the eye 
into thinking you are looking sideways instead of up.
The reverse can work as well -camera pointing down, subject on a post
Another is to go to a "Magic" supply shop and buy some "invisible" 
thread- although you will feel foolish buying it and doubtful that it 
really exists- it is actually a high strength fiber ( aramid?) that is 
quite thin and black and does not show up as much as fishing line.
Make sure you are at the Magic Shop and not the Joke Shop. ; )

Got through law school as an assistant to two ASMP pros in Miami.  I'll stop
lurking long enough to pass on that I've sprayed a few miles of 3 to 6 pound test
monofilament  fishing line with flat black paint in my time.  The use of spray
paint allows for varying shades of gray and black as the background requires.
Y'hafta be careful in the shower.

Tim, 

I was going to try your bleach and re-dev in lith technique as a basis for
some toning tests. I want to ascertain the possibility of producing
commercial portraits this way, for an individual look.
BTW I tried lith printing some I/R negs at the weekend. Bleached and toned
in selenium they are very beautiful.

Julian.

Neil,

I am waiting for Focus to buy some paper direct from Kentmere. I am not
able to decide between A/C and Kentona. A friend of mine has had horrid
problems getting the former to dry flat enough to frame. The edges
apparently cockle, but I think I could live with it for the colours.
MGWT, to me should only be used for something other than straight
printing!!   ;~)

Julian.

Dean,

It's a developer you'll either love or loathe. If you love it you'll never
look back... if you loathe it'll always niggle away at you and you'll wonder
if you should try it once more. In other words, it's addictive. I equate
pyro development to manual cameras... you have to work a bit harder at it,
but the result is always more satisfying because of the extra effort you've
put in.

Cheers,

  A little checking finds the author of _Discovering Yourself Through
Photography_ is indeed _Ralph_ Hattersley. I've sent a note to the AP to
check this and correct the story.

Julian,

I do most of my lith printing on Kentona and if I feel a neg
needs Art Classic I then switch to A/C . IMHO A/C doesn't suit
all negs where as Kentona almost certainly does. It is difficult 
to explain what suits A/C . Lately I've done a decent graveyard 
pic ( x3 ) and some tree pics + a harbour on A/C = all look v/ nice
:-)

Both Kentmere Kentona and Art Classic live up to Tim's
recommendations. Apart from Sterling papers what else is there
to try ????

Cheers,

Neil Souch.

Hello All,

I am another new boy to the list. I have been very interested in the =
discussions on the "perils" of selenium, and Guy's problem of gunge. I =
have not found gunge a serious problem, when making lith lookalikes, =
which is perhaps due to my choice of fixer, (I use a plain hypo and =
sodium metabisulphite mix), and the use of RC papers and may be my =
choice of original print developer, (D163). Ansel Adams, in his book =
"The Print" (page 132) says he used a hypo clearing bath before toning, =
though in a footnote he adds, the scientist at Eastman Kodak advised =
there may be no advantage. Nevertheless, in the present instructions =
with KRST Kodak suggests to reduce washing time, mixing with hypo =
clearing agent instead of water! Has anyone found this helps?

The discussion also made me think of finding a less hostile means of =
toning. A month or so ago I saw a print made by John Gould FRPS, (a =
maker of superb prints, here in the UK) which had lovely colours. Known =
as Chinese Prints - the name taken from China Hamilton, who with Liam =
Lawless, originated the technique. John said he used an iodine bleach, =
and toned in used fixer. Tim mentions this method in his article in =
Photo Art International Vol 2. Iss 16, but does not specify used fixer.  =
I used tincture of iodine BP 1:10 for the bleach, and tried various =
bleach times starting with full bleach back, and bleach times of only a =
few seconds. Washing before transferring to the fix, and also into the =
fix without washing. I  tried used fix, and also fresh plain hypo. My =
test pieces were four exposures on a single sheet of 10X8 paper, of a =
make that normally works well with lith lookalikes, giving me four print =
exposures from under to over in half stops. The resulting loss of =
density, varied producing a white sheet of paper with full bleach back, =
and loss of highlight to mid tone detail with shorter times.=20

Alas, the only colour produced in the whole trial was the final colour =
of my white processing tray, which is now an attractive yellow!=20
I think I have misunderstood the process somewhere along the line. Help!
Clifford.

Garry,

Funny you should say that... I've been looking at what the beautiful Sally
Mann has been doing recently. I know she's using Ortho film and toning *big*
prints with Tetleys tea bags (lousy, cheap English blend of tea, BTW)... but
the results look like hand coated plates from Victorian times.

Humph... having thought about it a bit more I think she has the right
approach... only I think her taste in tea could be improved upon!  8-0

Cheers,

Clifford,

Have you perhaps seen an example of the "Gould" technique from John Gould
which divides the print's tones into three distinct bands which are then
treated separately to give highlight tones of ordinary sepia, mid-tones of
weak sepia, and shadows of any colour from the Rainbow range of
(chromogenic) toners manufactured by Liam Lawless? Both John and Liam worked
on a lengthy feature in Darkroom User in the Jan.96 issue. This described
split-toning, short bleaching, selenium toning, second bleaching and
chromogenic toning, etc, etc... all very involved but producing, as you say,
beautiful results.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=3D"2">The discussion also made me think of finding a l=
ess hostile means of toning. A month or so ago I saw a print made by John Go=

s. Known as Chinese Prints - the name taken from China Hamilton, who with Li=
am Lawless, originated the technique. John said he used an iodine bleach, an=
d toned in <U>used</U> fixer. Tim mentions this method in his article in Pho=
to Art International Vol 2. Iss 16, but does not specify <U>used </U>fixer. =
&nbsp;I used tincture of iodine BP 1:10 for the bleach, and tried various bl=
each times starting with full bleach back, and bleach times of only a few se=
conds. Washing before transferring to the fix, and also into the fix without=
 washing. I &nbsp;tried used fix, and also fresh plain hypo. My test pieces =
were four exposures on a single sheet of 10X8 paper, of a make that normally=
 works well with lith lookalikes, giving me four print exposures from under =
to over in half stops. The resulting loss of density, varied producing a whi=
te sheet of paper with full bleach back, and loss of highlight to mid tone d=
etail with shorter times. <BR>
Alas, the only colour produced in the whole trial was the final colour of m=
y white processing tray, which is now an attractive yellow! <BR>
I think I have misunderstood the process somewhere along the line. Help!<BR=

I have tested MGWT in Lith and It produces ivory coloured prints. They do
tone in gold - but much slower than most lith prints. They get there in the
end tho'.

It's the same emulsion, but in my expereience AC colours are a bit more
muted. This may be a surface effect or related to the cream pigment that is
added. Both are lovely in lith and selenium tho'.

Can anyone tell me where I can buy PMK in Canada?  I tried the 3 main 
photographic stores in Ontario.  They had no idea what I was talking about 
when I asked for PMK Pryo developer.  Perhaps I should be asking for a 
trade name?  I've never used PMK but would like to try it...

I think a good earl grey would be a fine toner, especially for viewing prints

Mart,

Nah... Sally knows what she's doing... Tetleys tea bags are *full* of
tannin... Earl Grey, and especially my preferred brew Rooibos which has
virtually no tannin, just wouldn't stir her into action between kitchen and
darkroom.

BTW: Didn't ya just love my two Orland prints of the lovely lady.

Cheers,

Hi Friends -

First off, there is nothing to loathe about PMK.  If it isn't giving you the 
best negatives you've ever seen, either the chemisty is bad (and this is more 
common, particularly with oxidized part B, than you might think) OR your 
technique is off.  I've been an avid fine art photographer, developing my own 
negatives for nearly 40 years and PMK produces the most spectacular results 
possible in B&W photography.  Computer imaging types are now hyping digital to 
achieve the results that PMK gives because true compensation is almost 
impossible to achieve with regular B&W chemistry but is possible in digital and 
with pyro.

Second, you will never find this stuff in a camera store.  PMK stands for pyro-
metol-Kodalk.  Kodalk is sodium metaborate.  Search the web for the formula and 
suppliers.  You can buy kits from Photographer's Formulary in Montana:  
http://www.photoformulary.com

Don't know any reason it can't be shipped across the border.

Art Classic dries nice and flat for me - I simply wipe the surface water
off with an old windscreen wiper blade and then let it dry face up on a
towel.  I've never had  crinkly edges with either AC or Kentona.  Lovely
papers, both!

Likewise, I've been interested in obtaining Verichrome Pan.
The only thing that's put me off importing into the UK from
the US is the introduction of high power X-ray machines used
for air cargo and getting a guarantee of a refund if the film is
damaged during shipping.

Adorama www.adoramacamera.com in New York stock the film.

It's listed as: KODAK VERCHR 125 VP 120 *USA* $2.19
They will ship international.

I've e-mailed them to ask if they are willing to supply , shipping
charges, quantity pricing etc. and to clarify the X-ray situation.

As soon as I have a reply I'll post to the list, then we can continue
the discussion off list if needed.

Ed, yes I loved the Orland prints!  

Back to the tannin staining (as pots of tea are always on my mind, or heading 
toward the stomach) I once drank some Irish breakfast tea, the most tannic 
drink I have ever experienced and that included my 1st sample of an early 
Ausie export wine box called, would you believe, Kanga Rouge.  That was back 
in 1979 and I never forgot the experience!

Cheers

Those well known Oz wines, yes, Kanga Rouge and Wallaby White...  They've
come on a bit since then :-)

Well, loathe is not the appropriate word.  Photographic manufacturers stopped 
of pyro formulas for a number of very good reasons: 1) the move to smaller 
negative sizes required finer-grain film development.  Any pyro formula of the 
day would have yielded huge grain with early emulsions.  2) product liability 
is no small issue: pyro is poisonous beyond the levels of toxicity of anything 
else used for film development.  This we know.  We who use this chemistry in 
our art also use precautions to prevent exposure to pyro, including exposure to 
outgassing.  This is a matter of proper handling.  EK or Ilford could ill 
afford to expose themselves to the potential lawsuits it would bring them if 
they marketed PMK to the general public.  I don't blame them a bit.  Imagine if 
a bunch of high school students got hold of it!  So, I hope this answers why 
not loathe PMK and why manufacturers SHOULDN'T make it anymore.

Do you use PMK, Wayne?  I'd be happy to develop a roll for you if you'd like.

Curt

Tim,

Bostick and Sullivan, a supplier of non-silver printing supplies, will make
up a batch of Selenium for you, at about $60 for a gallon.  I had them do
this for me once but the results were different than Kodaks Selenium, but
may be what you are looking for.

Re your 2 points;=20

the disadvantage of mixing KRST with HCA is the short life of HCA and =
the long life of KRST. If you throw out when the HCA is exhausted you =
waste a lot of KRST - good for Kodak, bad for you.
It has also been demonstrated that archival protection with KRST is not =
as good, time for time, if they are mixed rather than separate.

Re 'Chinese prints' - You have certainly done something wrong!
Unfortunately the print I sent to PAI to illustrate this was left out =
because of space restrictions (- the article was too long basically! )=20
It is important to tone REALLY thoroughly with selenium BEFORE =
bleaching. You then bleach out the unconverted siler halides which mask =
the selenium colour with cold tone papers

  Hello All,

  I am another new boy to the list. I have been very interested in the =
discussions on the "perils" of selenium, and Guy's problem of gunge. I =
have not found gunge a serious problem, when making lith lookalikes, =
which is perhaps due to my choice of fixer, (I use a plain hypo and =
sodium metabisulphite mix), and the use of RC papers and may be my =
choice of original print developer, (D163). Ansel Adams, in his book =
"The Print" (page 132) says he used a hypo clearing bath before toning, =
though in a footnote he adds, the scientist at Eastman Kodak advised =
there may be no advantage. Nevertheless, in the present instructions =
with KRST Kodak suggests to reduce washing time, mixing with hypo =
clearing agent instead of water! Has anyone found this helps?

  The discussion also made me think of finding a less hostile means of =
toning. A month or so ago I saw a print made by John Gould FRPS, (a =
maker of superb prints, here in the UK) which had lovely colours. Known =
as Chinese Prints - the name taken from China Hamilton, who with Liam =
Lawless, originated the technique. John said he used an iodine bleach, =
and toned in used fixer. Tim mentions this method in his article in =
Photo Art International Vol 2. Iss 16, but does not specify used fixer. =
I used tincture of iodine BP 1:10 for the bleach, and tried various =
bleach times starting with full bleach back, and bleach times of only a =
few seconds. Washing before transferring to the fix, and also into the =
fix without washing. I  tried used fix, and also fresh plain hypo. My =
test pieces were four exposures on a single sheet of 10X8 paper, of a =
make that normally works well with lith lookalikes, giving me four print =
exposures from under to over in half stops. The resulting loss of =
density, varied producing a white sheet of paper with full bleach back, =
and loss of highlight to mid tone detail with shorter times.=20

  Alas, the only colour produced in the whole trial was the final colour =
of my white processing tray, which is now an attractive yellow!=20
  I think I have misunderstood the process somewhere along the line. =
Help!
  Clifford.

This little Pyro love-in has me wondering why the big companies no longer
market it like they used to. Surely there must be SOME reason to loathe it,
even if it makes the best darned negs this side of Photoshop.

Considering all known formulas and all the presently available developing agents and components_ I respectfully
disagree.

It all boiled down to cheaper, easier to mix, and longer self life products. Film format only accelerated the process.

dear list,

I have been reading for several years about the wonders of pyro. Processed
a few negs with it, wasn't impressed and went back to my regular developer.
i recently tried it again on 12x20 negs. The negs look great, but printing
with a cold light multigrade head made for vey long exposures. granted the
light source was a great distance up, casting a 20x24 rectangle of light,
and the negs required every bit of contrast i could add to them. 400
seconds for a basic exposure time seems a bit long to me. under a 15 watt
bulb suspended from the ceiling printing times were much shorter, 10 to 25
seconds.
is the light  from the cold light is absorbed by the stain, requiring more
exposure and higher contrast?

i just processed a duplicate neg shot at teh same time in id 11 and will
shortly make a comparision print, for exposure, contrast, and edge
seperation. am i the only one having this problem with extremely long
printing time with a vc cold light, vc paper, and pyro negs?

just asking.
tillman crane

Just a curiosity question. I have never seen the
results of Pyro development. What are the advantages
over standard development? Do you calibrate a "system"
like with regular developers figuring your Zone I and
Zone VIII exposure and development times? Does it
allow Zone system contrast control like regular
developers? And lastly can you use pyro in a BTZS type
tube rolling system (4x5 film)? Thanks.

  I have to, so I recently tried PMK+/Leban/Rollo with HP5+.
  First of all, following Carl Weese's instructions, I got negs that were
appropriately stained but of tremendously too high contrast for printing on
silver paper. I think they would've been perfect for platinum etc, but that
wasn't what I planned to print on.
  So..after a bit of fiddling around, I got the contrast down to a level
that was acceptable.
  Compared to HP5+ developed in D-76 1:1, the pyro negs were significantly
grainer, showed rather mediocre acutance, lost about a stop in "real" speed
and, when printed on VC paper, showed a huge amount of highlight compression.
  So...other than "heroic measures" contractions or for negs to print via
alt processes, pyro has shown me several disadvantages and only one
advantage, which I can achieve with a split developer that doesn't cause
the other disadvantages.
  Just my two cents worth.

Hi Tillman and group -

I've been admiring your work for many years, Tillman.  I mentioned your name
to a friend the other day as one of the top ten living American printers.  I
also understand the problems many have with their first trials with PMK.
Most first users get thin negatives, not big fat ones like you experienced,
however.  

While there are lots of other folks on the list who can give you
densitometer results from a PMK negative, I can say from a practical
perspective that there will be no noticable change in enlarging times with a
PMK negative than from printing negatives with MQ development.  The negative
you printed was either overexposed and overdeveloped or just overexposed. I
suspect the latter.  Overexposure of film developed in PMK will result in a
dense, flat negative - dense, primarily because the negative will never
block up like would an ID11 negative.  What you end up doing is throwing the
shadows farther and farther up the curve and you will need magenta
filtration and extra long printing times to force separation of the scale.
With an overexposed negative from MQ development, the highlights will be so
blocked up you frequently need to use yellow filtration to try to separate
the high values (depending, of course on the total scale of the negative).  

I regularly print everything from 35mm through 4x5 with no filtration at all
on my Omega Ds with Chromega heads.  Exposure times are typically 15 - 25
seconds at f/8 for an 11x14, for example.  Every so often, I'll need to add
some magenta...but never more than 25cc.  Less frequently, I'll use a vwery
few CCs of yellow.

One thing I've found consistently true: patience is required with PMK.
Learning to work with this stuff and its peculiarities takes some real time
and a bit of pain.  I've never known anyone to get great results the first
roll or the tenth.  Most naysayers will say (some with tremendous
overbearing authority, in fact): "oh, I tried PMK and it wasn't worth it for
the little benefit received."  Well, in point of fact, the benefits of PMK
are myriad.  I do realize it can take a while and LOTS of patience to get
used to it and actually SEE the difference on paper but once it hits, you
get hooked.  I could use any developer I want.  I'm not a cultist or into
weird stuff just to be different.  The dynamic range, the sharpness and edge
effect and the apparent reduction of grain in the print (NOT the negative on
the lightbox) are well worth this struggle.  And everyone who sees my prints
agrees.  You just need to persist.

Regards,
Curt

For those unfamiliar with pyro, please take note that this formula about
which John wrote is NOT PMK, and the results are VERY different from the
results obtained with PMK pyro.  I have heard many stories like this about PMK+.

Best,
Curt

I suppose there's a bit of truth here.  MQ developers were easier to use,
more predictable in results and more stable...but, oh my, the cost of
hydroquinone in the early years was, as I understand, very high.  EK had a
huge factory dedicated solely to the production of this one developing
agent.  I'm sure in later years hydroquinone production became a cash cow
type of operation and prices dropped.  Also, folks weren't lucky enough to
have PMK around :-)

I have been printing some 8x20 PMK pyro negatives w/o exposure times that
are that long Film - HP5+, ca 13 min in PMK, Ilford MG IV using a D-2 with a
Zone VI VC head.  Typical times are 20-60 sec. exposure.  (head is at the
top of the rail).

Yes the stain does absorb the blue light so printing times are longer with a
cold light head but I have seen only about a 1 to about 1.5 stop increase
for PMK vs a HC-110 negative.  The yellow stain also drops the effective
contrast on VC paper so some increase in filtration is needed.  Graded paper
does not show the same response due to its different sensitivity.

That's everything PMK does not. There are many variations based on PMK, 
more or less exotic, but if you stick to PMK as elaborated by Gordon 
Hutchings you should get very different results than the one you describe. 
Many photographers use PMK on a regular basis, and if it would be so bad, 
we would know by now. I would.

  This was formulary PMK+, or Leban, designed for rotary processing. I
couldn't imagine that what I was seeing were the same results others were
getting with Hutchings PMK, it was so...well, really mediocre.

Hello Nostalgia!

Hope this is appropriate posting for this list...

Picked that up from the Wisner site (www.wisner.com):

"News Flash: After some recent inquiries with the Great Yellow Father 
(Kodak), we have pursuaded them to consider (no promises here) bringing 
back the greatly missed Super XX. Thier stipulation: find out how much film 
would be sold in a year, and in what sizes. We are, in turn, and pending 
the response of our custumers, considering biting the bullet and bringing 
in 4x5, 5x7, 8x10, 7x17, 8x20 and 11x14. Its all up to you and your 
response. Email us and tell us if you are interested, and if so how much 
you might commit to in a year."


If you're interested in having Super XX back on the market, the one that 
the old guard used, it would help to drop a note at sales@wisner.com and 
let them know that you would be interested.
I am not associated in any way with Wisner, and do not even use one, but I 
thought that it may be an opportunity to have a classic film available. 
(And it is supposed to be wonderful for pyro!)

Cheers.

This was a great reply, Tim.  I'll add it to my PMK file to share with other 
doubters.  you really hit the nail on the head.  The other observation I've 
made is that I come from a rollfilm background and the tremendous benefit we 
get from PMK by not making any sacrifices to some negatives on the roll for the 
sake of others...within limits, of course.  Now I also use sheet film and 
absolutely wouldn't use anything else and lose that phenomenal range!

Well-those are some very real drawbacks and reasons to at least think twice
about using it. (perhaps loathe is too strong a word). 

>Do you use PMK, Wayne?  I'd be happy to develop a roll for you if you'd like.


What's a "roll"? is that what those minicams use? ;-)

No I dont use PMK. I'm just getting back into B&W after a decade of color.
I have heard of Pyro's miraculous wonders and naturally I'm curious- but
not sold, and I'm not convinced that I want its drawbacks despite its
apparent strengths. I love and want great images, of course, but not at all
costs.

I'm a believer in alternates, even if I'm a misguided "youth". Theres
always more than one way to skin a (insert dead animal here). The original
poster said that true B&W compensation is "almost" impossible w/out pyro or
digital.  OK, so whats the next best thing to pyro (besides digital)?
Something (tehcnique/chemical or both) that will give some of the
strengths, without some of the drawbacks. Something that will "almost"
achieve the impossible, or achieve the "almost" impossible. :)

It sounds like not everyone has had good experience with pyro, but that its
usually chalked up to inexperience.  Are there any long-time pyro users out
there that eventually defected to other techniques that gave them equally
satisfactory results?

Pyro acts like a so-called "compensating" developer in that the amount of development
in the shadows is effectively greater than in the highlights - it does not
exactly work that way, but the net effect is the same as a true compensating
developer.  This means that it is very difficult to block the highlights -
you can produce amazing negatives with better than 14 stops of printable information
in them in my experience!  The problem, of course, is that no paper can
handle that, so you have to make judgements about what pieces of that dynamic
range to print.

It is arguable that Pyro is the only developer that can do this, IMHO.  A
traditional compensating development technique achieves similar results,
albeit through an entirely different mechanism.  However, because of pyro's
staining mechanism, it achieves an amazing "look" that goes way beyond
highlight compensation.  You also get very distinct edge effects and grain,
though present, is "hidden" somewhat by the stain.

The downside of Pyro, which others have mentioned here, is that its toxicity
requires especially careful handling and lab technique.  It is also
very fussy and prone to rapid oxidation, so your agitation especially has
to be frequent and consistent.  

For a more complete treatment of this, see Hutchings' "Book Of Pyro" ...

but producing, as you say, beautiful results.=20

    The discussion also made me think of finding a less hostile means of =
toning. A month or so ago I saw a print made by John Gould FRPS, (a =
maker of superb prints, here in the UK) which had lovely colours. Known =
as Chinese Prints - the name taken from China Hamilton, who with Liam =
Lawless, originated the technique. John said he used an iodine bleach, =
and toned in used fixer. Tim mentions this method in his article in =
Photo Art International Vol 2. Iss 16, but does not specify used fixer.  =
I used tincture of iodine BP 1:10 for the bleach, and tried various =
bleach times starting with full bleach back, and bleach times of only a =
few seconds. Washing before transferring to the fix, and also into the =
fix without washing. I  tried used fix, and also fresh plain hypo. My =
test pieces were four exposures on a single sheet of 10X8 paper, of a =
make that normally works well with lith lookalikes, giving me four print =
exposures from under to over in half stops. The resulting loss of =
density, varied producing a white sheet of paper with full bleach back, =
and loss of highlight to mid tone detail with shorter times.=20
    Alas, the only colour produced in the whole trial was the final =
colour of my white processing tray, which is now an attractive yellow!=20
    I think I have misunderstood the process somewhere along the line. =
Help!

Maybe I can be more specific for my purposes. Some of the things that I've
read pyro excels at are

1)highlight separation
2)sharpness, accutance (lumped for sake of discussion)
3)edge effect
4)grain masking

Since I'll be doing mostly contact printing of 5x7 and 8x10 this time
around, some of these may be non-issues. Taking these one by one to see
which are most important to me:

highlight separation-highly desireable, I think, even if only because I
like the term "delicate highlight detail". I realize this is where pyro
really shines, but whats next best? Maybe second best is good enough for me.

sharpness, accutance-I dont know how important this is for contact
printing. Certainly I want the best negative sharpness and accutance that
will actually be noticeable in a contact print, but will pryo's superior
qualities in this area be noticeable in a contact print, or will I get just
as good results using another developer?

Edge effect-that would be highly desireable. I read in the Cookbook that
"pyro produces stronger and more consistant edge effect than any other
known developer". OK, so whats in second place, even if its a distant
second? I've glanced at most of the formulas and didnt see any others that
mention edge effect. Is there any way to induce "edge effect" during
development of a  print that is made from a negative without it?

Grain masking-non issue


So it looks like edge effect and highlight seperation are probably the two
most important things to me. Whats the next best thing to pyro for
achieving both these qualities? I could always just start trying formulas
from the cookbook, I have most of the chemicals already (except pyro), but
it would be much easier if someone just said "Use this" or "it simply cant
be done without pyro" (which it seems some people are already saying but
I'm looking for dissent among the ranks. ;-) I'm also willing to accept
somewhat less quality and quantity of the effects that are important to me,
 in return for losing some of the drawbacks of pyro.

 I use 35mm Ilford Delta 100 and 400 in  Pyro for my own work.
It's not a magic elixer-there are many wonderful film /developer 
combinations- but I do find that it produces the easiest to print " 
expressive " negatives of any developer I've seen. I am a high-end black 
and white printer for many clients and have seen dozens of film/developer 
combinations in many formats. None come close to Pyro in ease of 
printing. Processing with pyro on the front end saves tons of valuable 
time and materials when printing the negative. You aren't fighting the 
negative. The degree of dodging and burning is reduced  and you can 
concentrate on the "look/feel" instead of" is there any 
detail/information?".

This has been my experience with Pyro.  I first read about it in the old
Camera and Darkroom magazine about 8 years ago and I deceided to try it.  From
the very first print, I found that my time spent burning in highlights was
reduced by about 90%.  I was shooting surfers, and I always had a hard time
with detail in the whitewater.  I have been using it ever since, mostly with
Fuji Neopan 400 in 35mm and 120 rollfilm, and just recently with Konica
Infrared.

OK good people... thanks for the feedback on the presoak.  However I am still 
curious about why the antihalation layer washed off with the distilled water 
presoak, but not when I just go straight to the developer, without using the 
presoak.  The developer dumps just as clear as when it went in.

Thanks

It could be that the anti-halation dye turns colorless in the much more 
alkaline developer solution.

I can confirm that Photographer's Formulary does ship to Canada.  I bought
the chemicals from them needed to mix my own PMK.  They process your orders
very quickly.  Buy in bulk and cut down on the overall shipping costs.  

As far as I an aware, there is no supplier of PMK available in Canada.  I
even checked all of my known chemical supply companies in Canada, but found
none that stocked pyrogallol.

I use small tank development instead of rotary processors, but I am
interested in John's suggestion that presoaking does not cause a measurable
difference in development time.  I have heard many other photographers say
the same thing.

I have not tested this idea rigorously with a densitometer, but intuitively
it would seem to be something that deserves to be tested further.  I would
suggest that it is reasonable to suppose that presoaking would require a
slight increase in development time.  This idea needs careful scrutiny.

After presoaking, the film swells and the emulsion contains water - not
just on the surface - it has also penetrated into the film.  When the
developer is then used, it takes time for the developer to diffuse deep
into the emulsion.  As it does so, the pH of the developer is temporarily
suppressed on a microscopic level.  Initial agitation of the developer
affects the film surface; more time is needed for the developer to work its
way further into the emulsion.  This would be the basis upon which to
scrutinize the effect of presoaking.  If anyone is wiling to test this
hypothesis, using various film and developer combinations, there might be
some interesting things that are still to be learned about the effects of
presoaking on film development.  The physical effects of presoaking would
make for an interesting article.

Does anybody know if there is an ink that is acceptable for writing I.D. data 
on the back of Fiber prints processed for archival permanence?  Or is it 
necessary?

I have found that a good ol' #1 pencil works just fine.  You can use it 
before processing, too, and it makes it thru the solutions if, as I do, you 
choose to include processing info - dodging, burning times, etc. - so I don't 
have to take separate notes.

The ink is called Actinic ink. Light Impressions used to offer it. It is 
more generally available from stationers I think.  It comes in a jar and 
you use it with a nib/ quill  style pen. It is black and it has an 
unusual odor while it's wet. It is also toxic so don't drink it!
I use a pencil myself- softer than a #2 pencil though.

Thank you Richard.  I will keep this for future reference.  I was unaware
that anyone carried it.  I'll try to drop in next week when I'm in Toronto.

  Phil Davis published a comprehensive test in _Photo Techniques_ mag a
while back.
  In a nutshell, the results were that for a long presoak, (I don't
remember exactly what, but I think five minutes) some films gained or lost
speed, and some gained or lost contrast. Specifically, the changes were
_inconsistent_ among various brands and types of films.
  Or iow, the use of a long presoak may require changes in EI and/or
development time compared to no presoak, and the changes needed weren't
predictable.
  He also noted that a short presoak of one minute would have hardly any
and perhaps no discernible effect on EI or CI.

It's hard to beat India ink, which was once the medium for draftsmen doing 
building plans, etc.  Still available at "drafting supply" houses, now 
often d/b/a graphics or reprographics shops (blueprints, copying, quick 
printing).  Also sometimes known for surveyor's supplies (long measuring 
tapes, transits, etc.).  Typically used with a special fountain pen that 
has a tubular nib.

Pyro processing is available (and has been for years) in Toronto at The
Silver Shack, a custom B&W lab.  All PMK pyro processing is done with
Jobo rotary processing from 35mm to 8X10.  The owner, Bob Carnie, states
that pyro is his most popular developer.  He obviously deals with a very
knowlegable, exacting, and discriminating clientele...

    Here is one mail order photochemical supplier in Canada that I have =
not seen mentioned, yet.

            Johnny De Iure
            5835 Chambly Rd.
            St. Hubert, Qc
            J3Y 3R4
            Canada

            Tel: (450) 678-1920 or (450) 462-3136
            Fax: (514) 678-4411
            Web Site: www.cyberagepc.net/photochemicals
            E-mail: photochemicals@cyberagepc.net

    The best time to talk to him is in the evening, eastern time. His =
price list is posted on his web site, in American dollars. Canadian =
customers add 1/3rd. His prices are reasonable and there is no border to =
deal with...yet. I found him quite helpful. I have not asked him if he =
packaged kits...but you pay a premuim for that service from anybody. =
You'll save money getting a scale and buying in bulk. Then, you can make =
up small batches that won't go south before you get a chance to use it =
all up!

    In the states, there is also:

            Artcraft Chemicals, Inc.
            P.O. Box 583
            Schenectady, NY 12301

            Tel: (800) 682-1730=20
            Fax: (518) 355-8700
            E-mail: Jacobson@Juno.com

    He has kits and prepackaged photo chemicals, including PMK. He's =
another one that is easier to get a hold of in the evening.

Greetings from Winterpeg...the home of the dry cold. =20

The question of the effect of darkroom effluent upon sceptic waste systems
manages to come up with some regularity, as does the discussion of the
relative level of toxicity of this waste.  For those interested in the topic,
see the current issue (Mar/Apr 2000) of 'Photo Techniques'.  Robert Chapman's
regular column on Photochemistry covers the topic very nicely...

I'm intrigued by the suggestion to use Rodinal as a paper developer (sorry,
forgot who it was).  The poster suggested cool deep blacks were one pleasant
by-product (if I remember
correctly).

Anyone else tried this?  What are the pros and cons?  How does it compare
with your usual poison of choice? Of course I'll experiment myself, but just
wondering if any others have any wisdom to share...

 From Russell Baston, I accidently used Rodinal as a paper developer, by
picking up the wrong bottle in darkroom gloom. Results were WONDERFUL ! Only
one snag, it has a half life less than sub atomic particles,Rodinal is quite
expensive in uk so I think you would need funding to complete a portfolio,
seriously a 2 litre dish -- 200 dev plus 1800 H2O lasts 2 prints then goes
dead,zilch ,the end ,nothing.

Hello, dear list members !
On my Web browsing, some time ago I've found a _really_ interesting
article dealing with the Ilford washing sequence for film.
This sequence devised by Ilford state that it is better to was a film
for a few cycle, in its tank exchanging water after some tank inversion
than to run water for minutes.
Mr  Rolf Suessbrich ( mailto:rohan.sb@cityweb.de ) has done a great deal
of work experiencing this washing sequence to test the correctness and
efficiency of this sequence.
The results of its experiments can be found in a really neat PDF paper
at :
http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Thinktank/5693/photogra.html
You will need Adobe's Acrobat Reader to fully appreciate it, but it's
worth the effort.

Unfortunately, Mr Suessbrich has not gone through experiment on washing
papers. As water (almost "pure" drinkable one) will go more and more
expensive, and as we must preserve earth resources, I'm wondering what
you have to say about this controversial subject.
My intent is to use the least amount of water able to wash my films and
paper perfectly. So any comment will be greatly appreciated.
Cheers !

Hello !
I do agree !
My standard processing sequence is to use a presoak, and I dump it in a
bucket.
At the end of the dev. stage, I dump the used dev in the same bucket. In
seconds, the colored water turns clear....
Hope this helps !

Hello !
Interestingly enough, I use presoak because I've been taught (a long
time ago) that it helped developer diffusion due to the fact that the
presoak had broken the superficial tension preventing the developer to
wet the film !
As I am not a physicist I can't state if I am wrong, so I hope you will
help me check if it is a "urban legend" or not !
cheers !

Every winter the snow piles up in the mountains & percolates down to the
springs. Fresh water is available & is used as needed for lawns, swimming
pools and cleaning driveways at the grocery stores, gas stations and others
with big lots. The amount used to wash film & papers isn't going to cost
most of us much at all.

As to 'almost pure drinkable water', a lot of us have water hard enough to
crack granite. Others with water laced with iron and other minerals. Pure
drinking water for chemistry & rinsing for us has to be run through filters,
softening, reverse osmosis, etc., to be usable. That is where the cost comes
in.

I agree with using as little as needed, mainly to save time spent on the
machanical aspects of the process. Otherwise I will wash more than the
minimum needed, checking from time to time for residual chemicals left in
film & paper both. On earths 'resources', we aren't running out of much at
all other than what we lift into space & can't recover. Recycling happens
whether we plan it or wait until the substances come back to us(whether we
want them to or not). In the world, nothing is wasted. Use water & it runs
off into drains, eventually finding its way back into clouds & rain. If you
live in an area where water is getting more expensive to buy then go for
minimal amounts. If not, or you want to be certain the rinse is adequate,
use what you need to do so.

I live in a desert & the state of Utah uses more water per household than
most states do-odd for a place ranked the second driest in the nation(USA).
But if I am willing to pay for it I can 'waste' it if I like.

I have seen many of these in 5x7 format - my assumption is that they were

Thanks for the link.
I have a slightly different take on resource conservation.
 Some people use RC paper because it uses less water and make "quick " 
prints because it saves time.
I believe in making fine prints on fiber washed to archival standards so 
that the "nice" prints don't have to be made again or replaced every 10 
years. I like not wasting water but more importantly I think it's a waste 
of time to make non-archival or low quality prints. My own personal 
experience is that the prints from the first 10 or so years of my 
photography career were all a big waste .They are now brown / peeling/ or 
doing funky things with silvering ( see the Ctein article about RC 
archival properties ). (see Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance for 
more on  quality.)
The best thing I ever learned was that all prints leaving my darkroom be 
archival so as not to contaminate any other prints. And the best way to 
save time and materials was to do it right the first time.
To address your feelings about water conservation- eventually the 
population will outgrow our current sources of potable water. So yes it 
needs to be used wisely.

Thanks for the response.  It was mostly just a matter of curiosity.  It all 
does make sense.

 Hello !
 I do agree !
 My standard processing sequence is to use a presoak, and I dump it in a
 bucket.
 At the end of the dev. stage, I dump the used dev in the same bucket. In
 seconds, the colored water turns clear....
 Hope this helps ! >>

Another way to look at it is to use the tried and true mix.  One oz of HC110
and 31 oz's to make one quart.  That way you only use it as you need it.
The concentrate will last a good deal longer than mixed like Kodak wants you
to mix it.  I have been using it this way for around 20 years and I never
have a problem.
As usual,
Lee Carmichael

Thank you Howard and Lee for your answers.
Lee can you tell me, with your way do you expell the air from the container
as you use the concentrate and how long will the concentrate last this way.
Thank you
Phil.

Phil,
I processed some film last week using HC-110 from a bottle that is +- 3/4 
full. I bought it almost 3 years ago. And the film came out just fine. 
Seems the gooey stuff concentrate can last for ever (almost...)

I don't do anything to expel the air from the container.  I have seen the
concentrate last a long time.  I process so much film that it really doesn't
get old around here.  But I think mixed like Kodak says, 3 months is about
all you can expect.

They are quite common and are for the Magic Lanterns...the original slides of 
ages ago.  Glass negatives are also kind of common...used to the early part 
of the last century (wow...that sounds weird to say about the 1900's!!!).  I 
have seen glass negatives up to the 1940's.

I am amazed and delighted to have tracked down both the videos that I so 
wanted to see. I posted the message on the photo history list as Jonathan 
Bailey suggested, and among other useful suggestions was directed to Facets 
multi-media (www.facets.org ) Which seems a v. useful resource, where they 
had Ann Hershey's film. By co-incidence my letter to Meg Partridge which had 
gone astray reached her, and so she is sending the other, as well as one on 
Dorothea Lange. (www.megpartridge.com ) Thank you all for so kindly helping 
me in my search. Saffron.

For the Magic Lanterns, would/could they have also hand colored the plates?
The reason for my inquiry is that an associates family member died and upon
searching thru their stuff found a couple of hundred glass plate positives
of hawaii in the 20's which got us thinking of the why's and historical
importance (or lack thereof) them.
thanks for the answers.

Don't know if it's still true, but glass plates were the only thing allowed to be 
used in Astrological Photography when I was at Indiana University in early 50's.

I have used both Kodak HC110 and Ilford Ilfotec HC from the concentrate at
over 12 months after originally opening with no discernible deterioration in
the solution or the developed result, and I am fussy. However I always use
Tetenal's excellent Protectan antioxidant spray in the top of all my
developer bottles. Incidentally (1), as long as you don't 'waft' the air
around, you can also spray this on the top of part used dev. left in a tray
overnight.
Incidentally (2), has anyone else discovered that Agfa's Neutol WA (must be
WA) carries on working in the dish for days even when it has gone the most
turgid colour, and that the tones it then produces are warmer and tone in
selenium even more effectively? Tim Rudman uses 'old brown' lith developer.
I use 'old brown' Neutol WA. I have the bottom 1/4 of a 5 litre bottle of
the concentrate 21/2 years old which resembles molasses. It still develops
up prints to a rich warm black. I add some to fresh developer to warm up the
tones and aid tonability.

The reason for my inquiry is that an associates family member died and upon
searching thru their stuff found a couple of hundred glass plate positives
of hawaii in the 20's which got us thinking of the why's and historical
importance (or lack thereof) them.
thanks for the answers.

yes, some were hand colored....some, especially a series of Ancient Egypt 
from the turn of the century (well...LAST century!) had such incredible 
detail and artistic embelishments by hand that they are quite expensive.

Indeed they could, and did.  I bought a box of over a hundred of these, most 
hand "tinted" (too dark would affect light transmission), from the nineteen 
teens.  The scenes are mostly of "native" peoples from Africa, S.E. Asia, 
South Pacific, etc.  I get they impression they were done for lecture work, 
perhaps by missionaries.  They're in perfect condition.  Not bad for ten 
bucks at a yard sale.  The next year, I picked-up a pristine Beseler 
lanternslide projector, in its original steel carrying case, at another yard 
sale.  Fifteen bucks.  One of these days I'll have a show.

Thank you for the tips, diluting the concentrate as i need it seems a good
economical way of using it. If you don't mind me going on, because the
mixture is so thick how do you accurately measure small quantities say to
mix a working solution of 600mL and can i ask for dev times and asa ratings
for plus x pan 120, i will be using a colour head enlarger. I will conduct
some tests but it would be nice to have a starting point from experienced
users.
Thank you for your patience.
Phil.

Hello.
My name is Michael Spedding and I am a new subscriber to pure-silver
I noticed in one of the E.mails on film and print washing a reference to Ilfords recommendations. I offer the following comments which may be of interest.

Film washing.
Ilford recommend that a film can be adaquately washed in 4 or 5 half minute changes of water at 20'C. The ilford manual quotes "Only a small dilution factor, of the order of a hundred-fold, is needed to bring the thiosulphate content of the emulsion down to a satisfactory level. This condition can be acheived comfortably in a three stage wash."
The alternative of washing in colder running water has to continue for a longer but uncertain time and it's effectiveness is not guaranteed.

The procedure recommended by Ilford is to make up several litres of water at at the same temperature of the other processing solutions, nominally 20'C.
pour ot the fixerand remove any remaining drops with a quick rinse in this water. Then fill the tank and give 10 inersions, pour and repeat giving 20 inversions, pour out and repeat giving 40 inversions.
Barry Thornton in his excellent book 'Elements', recommends leaving the top off the tank and plunging the spiral up and down in a tank full of water at the right temperature for 40 seconds. Using not less than 6 changes of water, proportinaly more changes being used for more than one film.

The rationale being, that as is seems to take 30 seconds for fixer concentration in the film and the tank to equalise, this wash method is highly effective.
this is followed by a rinse in deionised water containing wetting agent. It is pointed out that it is important to leave the film in the solution long enough for diffusion to occur, ie 30 seconds.

it is also important not to use a hardening fixer, as this will reduce the effectiveness of the water to diffuse away fixation products.

washing prints.
Ilford recommend the following procedure for archival washing of fibre base prints.
1. Fix in a rapid non-hardening fixer at film strength (Ilford Hypam at 1+4 is recommended) for 30 seconds.
2. 5 minute wash.
3. 10 minutes in a washaid.
4. 5 minutes|wash.
Fixing, wash aid and washing should all be at 20'C.

Two points are important

1. The fixing time should not be exceeded. (certainly no more than 1 minute, which was Ilfords original recommendation). Otherwise this strength of fixer will have a significant effect on the thiosulphate content of the finished print, and may cause slight bleaching of the print highlights.

2. Ilford recommend that the silver level of the fixer is not taken beyond 0.5 grams/litre (10 8x10 prints or the equivalent.) Fixer used up to 0.5 grams/litre can be further used for films or RC prints up to a recommended level for 'commercial permanence' of 2grams/litre of silver.

I also have a query. I beleive that Kodak verichrome pan film in 120 format is available from some US professional dealers. can anyone sugest a contact who would be willing to supply to me in the UK.

                                     Cheers
                                         Mike.

I remember very well my first job (1968) as a junior photographer on a 
newspaper in Windsor (the one with the castle) where, as part of my training, 
I was handed a single D/Darkslide, an MPP and a box of 5x4 glass plates.  I 
had been told one D/D per job.  Having never loaded glass plates before it 
took me one heck of a load of licking to find the emulsion and over an hour 
to complete the task.  I think it all had something to do with my turning up 
for the job armed with a Nikon while everyone else had Rollie 2.8's.

I have never forgotten the experience!

Barry, I think that there might be some strange affinity between Agfa 
chemistry and long life.  I regularly use Rodinal after it has also gone the 
colour of molasses and remember joking with Ed Buziak over the need to lay 
down Rodinal!  Obviously the fresh stuff lacked character and body!

Cheers

Phil...  you may wish to check Fred Picker's Zone System book. 
He devotes a lot of time to methods of developing your personal EI for various films. 
If no one else responds, or you can't find the book, contact me and I'll fax or send the 
appropriate pages next week. PX- can't help, never use.

Thank you for the tips, diluting the concentrate as i need it seems a good
economical way of using it. If you don't mind me going on, because the
mixture is so thick how do you accurately measure small quantities say to
mix a working solution of 600mL and can i ask for dev times and asa ratings
for plus x pan 120, i will be using a colour head enlarger. I will conduct
some tests but it would be nice to have a starting point from experienced
users.
Thank you for your patience.
Phil.

Dear Phil:
Many thanks for your repy. I do not know B&H, I assume they are in th USA. Do you have a contact adress and do you think they would be willing to supply by mail order to the UK? I currently use mainly HP5+ and FP4+, I used a lot of verichrome pan in the 1960's I particularly liked it's long scale gradation which is in the tradition of the old thick emulsion films. It has not been available in the UK to my knowledge for nearly 20 years. I have recently seen a reference to it's availability in the US in Steve Anchells book 'the film development cookbook'

Dear Jim:
	Did the "hot link" come through.  I was hoping you could click on the
B&H link, and it would take you to their site.  My only caution (and the
only complaint I've ever heard from them) is don't include liquid
chemistry with your order.
	I heard a rumor of VP being discontinued later this year, but haven't
been able to track it down, and the Kodak site does have listings of
discontinued products.
	B&H is the largerst NYC dealer, and they've gotten that way by being
honest and reliable, unlike many NYC shops which thrive on theivery. 
Adorama is also good, I use them if B&H is out of stock.
	VP is a "nostalgia" film for me.  I used it in my Brownie Hawkeye box
camera in the late fifties.  Now I've found it great in my
Rolleiflexes.  I love the "Film Development Cookbook!" and recommend it
all the time.  I use a lot of Xtol and Rodinal, and since reading the
Cookbook, have gone back to shooting more VP, Tri-X, and HP-5.
	Let's try another hot link: http://www.bhphotovideo.com/
Also, do you look at Photo.net?  My favorite photo site.
http://photo.net/photo/index.html
I've always heard that B&H does ship abroad.  I don't know what the
story is on international toll free numbers.  I would fax my order if
possible.  Calls are often on hold for a long time, which would be a
drag if you were paying international rates.  There is also an on line
order form, credit card numbers in cyberspace give some people worries.
	Let me know how it turns out,
	Phil

Michael,

In their publication:

http://www.ilford.com/html/us_english/pdf/Papr_Chem.pdf

Ilford states the capacity for 1 liter of fixer used in their archival process 
is 40 8x10's.  Do you have newer/different information recommending a 
capacity of 10 8x10's?

They ship anywhere. Just make sure to ask what the shipping charges would 
be to your destination. Also, you may ask them to send you  a 'SourceBook', 
it's a 600-page book/catalog very well done, and their catalog, which has 
darkroom prices. They're also on the net at www.bhphotovideo.com, but it's 
mostly equipment.

 I believe the capacity given by Ilford is 40 8x10 sheets per GALLON if a
single bath fixer is used. This is a valid number, I'm afraid if you want
complete fixing. 
  The capacity can be enormously increased by using a two-bath set up. One
starts with two fresh fixing baths. The film or paper is fixed in the first
one for half the normal time, then drained (and preferably rinsed) and
fixed for the remainder of the time in the second bath. 
  Fixing is not a simple process. The undeveloped halide goes through at
least three successive reactions before it is converted into a highly water
soluable form which will wash out of the emulsion. Each stage results in
its becoming more soluable. If the fixing is not complete some halide
remains in a non- or only slightly- soluable stage which will remain in the
emulsion despite very extended washing or the use of a clearing agent.
These reaction products start degenerating very quickly, within a few days
they will become converted to a form which will not be removed by re-fixing
and which will attack and eventually destroy the image. Complete fixing is
probably the single most important element in obtaining long image life.
  The two-bath fixing system insures that the fixing process will be
completed. The second bath remains relatively fresh, especiallly if a brief
rinse is included between baths. When the first bath reaches capacity it is
tossed and replaced with the second bath. A fresh bath is mixed for the
second bath. The capacity of fixer is extended to about 100 sheets of 8x10
filkm or prints by this technique along with insuring complete fixing.
  Ilford's single bath use of rapid fixer in their "archival" fixing and
washing process may not result in complete fixing for many emulsions. The
result may be very impermanent images.
  A note: I recently talked with Dr. Douglas Nishimura at IPI and got some
Xerox copies of a research report they did on the treatment of microfilm
for permanence. I will be getting more information, soon, I hope. I suggest
looking at the papers and letters under Dr. Nishimura's name on the
Conservation On-Line site at http://palimpsest.stanford.edu  Just do a name
search for him.
  When I have everything organized I will post a long piece here on fixing,
washing, and toning for permanence.

  Verichrome Pan is available only in 120 roll film and in rolls for Cirkut
cameras.
  Probably the closest other Kodak emulsion is Plus-X pan in 35mm and roll
film sizes. Not the same but similar.
  Plus-X pan in sheet film sizes is a completely different emulsion (thanks
Kodak).

   That is 100 sheets per liter, not gallon, when two baths are used. 

  I did not make it clear that when a single bath is used its capacity for
completing the fixing process is much less than its capacity for simply
clearing the emulsion. Clearing will take place long after the fixer is no
longer completely converting the halides into a fully soluable form.  The
second bath insures the reactions are complete.
  Kodak has instructions on how to use a two-bath fixer in _The Kodak
Black-and-White Darkroom Dataguide_ and in other publications. Its probably
on thier web site somewhere too.
  With some caution an Iodide test solution can be used to determine when
the bath capacity has been reached.

Marten,

There's much to be said of "matured" developer... when I mix a new 5 litre
batch of ID-11 (or, less commonly, D-76) I use about 1/4 litre from the old
bottle to mix with the new. All the photographers (woops, I mean darkroom
technicians... different union in those days to us "stills" guys) I knew in
the TV studios used to mix it that way to take the harsh edge of the fresh
brew.

According to the publication cited above, it is 40 8x10's per LITER.

Question on two-bath fixing:  Would it be reasonable to do a 30 second 
fix in "bath one", then leave the prints in a water bath holding tray for 
some time (maybe hours), THEN do another 30 second fix in "bath 
two"?  My sink isn't long enough for two fixing trays, but I could change 
fixer when all prints are done and do a second fix.

  I'll have to look a the version of the paper you've linked to. By memory
I think Ilford gave the figure of 10 sheet per liter for single bath fixing. 
  I think that two 30 second baths with a holding bath would work fine
provided that its long enough to fix the emulsion. Evidently, it may not be
for some Kodak papers. 
  There is even a suggestion in one early Kodak paper that a holding bath
between two fixing baths may help the washing procedure but its not very
clear about that. 
  The Ilford process is based on preventing hypo from penetrating the paper
fibers and getting stuck there. Washing from the emulsion is a diffusion
process but washing from the fiber paper structure is not entirely. If I
understand it correctly there is some frictional force involved which
greatly retards the removal of the hypo.
  A sulfite wash aid is very effective in speeding the washing process,
Ilford uses a ten minute soak. They did not experiment with using more than
one wash aid bath, I can't find any research on that.
  There is a lot of conflicting information about just what is best to do
for increasing the life of images. For one thing a small amount of residual
hypo (but not fixing reaction products) in the emulsion acts as a
stabilizer for the images. The hypo residue causes a layer of sulfide to be
formed on the silver crystals resulting in a considerable amount of
protection against oxidizing and reducing agents in the atmosphere. An
emulsion which has been completely freed of hypo is much more vulnerable
than one which has some hypo in it. Of course, the amount is important. If
too much hypo is left in it will attack the image in the usual way. Most
image damage, especially to displayed images, comes from oxidants in the
atmosphere rather than any impurity in the print.
  Toning with a sulfiding toner provides nearly complete protection.
Reasonably full toning with a Selenium toner does also. However, the
frequently advised toning in highly diluted selenium (1:20 or more) has
been found not to work. The Selenium is selective of the silver crystals it
tones, toning those in high density areas first. Toning in highly diluted
Selenium does not protect the highlights. Dr. Nishimura suggests toning in
Selenium at not more than 1:9 dilution, for not less than three minutes.
  An alternative for toning without much change in color or density is to
use Kodak Brown Toner but there are problems with this. Polysulfide toners,
unlike other toners, work faster as they are diluted. At very high
dilutions Brown toner will cause pink or peach colored stains in the
highlights. It probably should be used at about 1:10 for image protection.
The IPI paper exposing the lack of effectiveness of KRST for protecting
microfilm suggested the use of Brown toner at 1:200, it turns out this was
simply a reference to the fact that this toner would provide image
protection in a few seconds at this dilution  because it works so fast. In
practical use it results in the stains refered to above. Brown toner should
be used in much greater concentrations for practical use. 
  I will write more about this when I am able to review it with Dr.
Nishimura to make sure I don't put my foot in it.
   I also have the formula for IPI Silver-Lock toner. This is similar to
Kodak Brown Toner but is intended for controlled toning of microfilm.
Probably for prints the Brown toner is good enough. The formula for
SilverLock has been published and is not proprietary. I also have the IPI
formulas for testing solutions to check the effectiveness of the toner.
While these are intended for microfilm work they should be useful for
pictorial negatives and prints too. 
  Gold toning is also effecive, provided enough of the silver is converted,
its too expensive for routine use.
  Another note while I'm at it. The formula for Kodak Hypo Clearing Agent
is proprietary but is avialable, I've posted it to the darkroom group and
maybe even here. It is sometimes stated that for prints the bisulfite
buffer is not needed and the sulfite alone is satisfactory. In fact, the
bisulfite is important. The working clearing agent is neutral in pH. That
is to minimise emulsion swelling. The washing process is most accelerated
when the emulsion is neutral. Kodak's packaged product also has some EDTA
in it. That is also important, it prevents the deposit of sulfite on the
print or film.

  Are you asking about plates specifically?  I've used both emulsions on
conventional film supports, the behaviour of the glass plates should not be
very different.
  I like T-Max films, many do not, I think its mostly a matter of taste.
Technical Pan, when developed in a suitable very low contrast developer is
very fine grained and makes nice prints. However, it has an odd H&D curve,
with some shouldering, and doesn't look like other films. It is also a Type
"C" panchromatic film with considerably more red sensitivity than most
other pan films. It will tend to wash out skin tones, especially when the
light is warm, as with late afternoon sunlight or tungsten light. A green
filter will fix this, but at the ocnst of a couple of stops of speed for an
already very slow emulsion.
  I don't see any practical advantage in using glass plates for ordinary
photography other than being able to say you've done it.

  I asked about it. Sistan is a stabilizer using Thiocyanate along the
lines of the stabilizers used in the stabilizing process. Under some
circumstances it provides some protection but not nearly as much as
sulfiding. I can inhibit the sulfiding by residual thiosulfate so in some
cases its use actually accelerates attack by polutants. I am told via the
grape vine that Agfa knows this. The accelerated aging tests were
dissapointing to them.

I also have long been interested in getting some 120 Verichrome Pan, and
have tried without success. If it is available in the US, and there is a way
of getting some to the UK, count me in if we need to get together to achieve
a big enough order size.

Dear Phil:
Many thanks for your repy. I do not know B&H, I assume they are in th USA.
Do you have a contact adress and do you think they would be willing to
supply by mail order to the UK? I currently use mainly HP5+ and FP4+, I used
a lot of verichrome pan in the 1960's I particularly liked it's long scale
gradation which is in the tradition of the old thick emulsion films. It has
not been available in the UK to my knowledge for nearly 20 years. I have
recently seen a reference to it's availability in the US in Steve Anchells
book 'the film development cookbook'

Please note that Ilford increased their time to one minute from 30 seconds
when Multigrade 4 was introduced. The way this technique works is to provide
long enough for the image to fix, but too short a time for non-water soluble
compounds to penetrate and bind to the fibres in the paper support material.
It has always puzzled me how the Kodak two bath method avoided this problem.
There is a really good exploration of Ilford's method in the second edition
of 'Controls in Black and White Photography' by Dr. Richard Henry (Focal
Press), which is a wonderful book for debunking photographic old wives'
tales if you haven't seen it.

 I believe the capacity given by Ilford is 40 8x10 sheets per GALLON if a
single bath fixer is used. This is a valid number, I'm afraid if you want
complete fixing.
  The capacity can be enormously increased by using a two-bath set up. One
starts with two fresh fixing baths. The film or paper is fixed in the first
one for half the normal time, then drained (and preferably rinsed) and
fixed for the remainder of the time in the second bath.
  Fixing is not a simple process. The undeveloped halide goes through at
least three successive reactions before it is converted into a highly water
soluable form which will wash out of the emulsion. Each stage results in
its becoming more soluable. If the fixing is not complete some halide
remains in a non- or only slightly- soluable stage which will remain in the
emulsion despite very extended washing or the use of a clearing agent.
These reaction products start degenerating very quickly, within a few days
they will become converted to a form which will not be removed by re-fixing
and which will attack and eventually destroy the image. Complete fixing is
probably the single most important element in obtaining long image life.
  The two-bath fixing system insures that the fixing process will be
completed. The second bath remains relatively fresh, especiallly if a brief
rinse is included between baths. When the first bath reaches capacity it is
tossed and replaced with the second bath. A fresh bath is mixed for the
second bath. The capacity of fixer is extended to about 100 sheets of 8x10
filkm or prints by this technique along with insuring complete fixing.
  Ilford's single bath use of rapid fixer in their "archival" fixing and
washing process may not result in complete fixing for many emulsions. The
result may be very impermanent images.
  A note: I recently talked with Dr. Douglas Nishimura at IPI and got some
Xerox copies of a research report they did on the treatment of microfilm
for permanence. I will be getting more information, soon, I hope. I suggest
looking at the papers and letters under Dr. Nishimura's name on the
Conservation On-Line site at http://palimpsest.stanford.edu  Just do a name
search for him.
  When I have everything organized I will post a long piece here on fixing,
washing, and toning for permanence.

I use a syringe from my local pharmacist, but not the sharp needle kind.
Those with a blunt needle have a much thicker needle and proportionately
wider hole through which to draw up the thick concentrate. I use a few
flushes of water afterwards to clean out the syringe using this water as
part of that used to dilute the measured concentrate for use. You will need
to mix the water and concentrate vigorously to get proper dispersion. I
admit to pressing my hand over the top of the measuring cylinder containing
water and concentrate and shaking it up like a cocktail. Now there's another
use for a cocktail chaser!
I do not have times for PX, but Ansel Adams in 'The Negative' arrived at an
EI of 64 for 35mm, 120, and sheet film. He gives times for 1:15 dilution of
Kodak's stock solution of HC110 (i.e. not of the concentrate) of 10 mins.
for 35mm 'N' development, 10.5 for 120 and 12 for sheet. I always found his
times to be pretty good for my own negatives, but PX may well have changed
emulsion formulation after all these years. It's a starting point anyway.

Thank you for the tips, diluting the concentrate as i need it seems a good
economical way of using it. If you don't mind me going on, because the
mixture is so thick how do you accurately measure small quantities say to
mix a working solution of 600mL and can i ask for dev times and asa ratings
for plus x pan 120, i will be using a colour head enlarger. I will conduct
some tests but it would be nice to have a starting point from experienced
users.
Thank you for your patience.

  It should be. Kodak has two test solutions for checking for residual
halide. One is a solution of sodium sulfide, the other is a 1:9 dilution of
KRST. Kodak recommends the KRST over the sulfide because it is more stable
and the colors produced more nearly match the colors on the Kodak test
chart. Completely fixed films or papers should not produce any staining
with KRST. However, acid in the emulsion may cause a deposit of colloidal
elemental Selenium. This can be eliminated by the use of a sulfite wash aid
or a bath in 2% carbonate or Kodalk before washing. I don't have data on
the sensitivity of this test. 
  The effectiveness of the toner is determined by the use of a dichromat
bleach to remove the metallic silver image. The effecivness of the toner in
protecting the image is tested with a Hydrogen Peroxide immersion test.
Both procedures are rather long, I will post them later. Again this is
aimed at microfilm. Prints are a bit different but no work was done
directly on print or pictorial film emulsion, both of which are somewhat
more resistant to redox problems than microfilm.

  Barry Sinclair of Ilford said a while back that the reason the
recommendation was changed to one minute was that people often didn't use
fresh-enough fixer solutions for the 30-second fix to be "safe."  He said
that with fresh fixer and Ilford paper, 30 seconds was fine.

Not those two emulsions, and not for general photography, but I've used
glass plates quite a bit.

I work in holography, and the dimensional stability of glass plates make
them by far preferable to film substrates for that application. I have
used Agfa 8E75HD, 8E56HD and 10E75 plates for holography. All these
emulsions are unfortunately discontinued. I have also used Kodak 649F and
Kodak HR1A emulsions. We still use Agfa Millimask plates for holography,
even though the intended application for these plates is photolithography
for chip production - but the characteristics for these plates is so
similar to the discontinued 8E56HD that one may wonder... We have also
tried various other emulsions, particularly Russian types.

For some experiments in Lippmann photography, I have used Agfa 8E75HD
plates and Kodak 649F plates. When I get the time for it, I'm probably
going to try Slavich panchromatic plates for the same purpose.

I have also in my student days used Ilford FP4 plates for spectroscopy.

If you can, try using a pipette and a pipette pump.  This will allow you to
make up enough of the diluted developer to do a few rolls of film, without
having to dilute the entire bottle of concentrate.  Undiluted, the
concentrate has a very good shelf life, even if all of the air is not
expelled from the bottle.
   I use a 10 mL pipette, graduated in 10ths of a mL, but a 20mL pipette
would also work well, because you need 16mL of the concentrate to make up
500 mL of the B dilution when developing two - 35mm rolls in a double tank.
 Burettes also work well, but they are more expensive.  On a stand, they
hold a greater volume.  The concentrate can be ready to use, in one-shot
form, as required, capping the burette tube when not in use.  Unless you
are developing a large number of rolls at once, I'd strongly recommend
using the technique described here, instead of mixing an entire batch, as
Kodak recommends.

  D-76 mixed to the original published formula becomes more active with
time. The reason is a complex reaction of the hydroquinone with the sulfite. 
  Packaged D-76 is a buffered modification of the original formula,
published as D-76d. This contains both Borax and boric acid. It does not
change activity significantly with time
  The reason for adding some used developer to developing machines is to
add some bromide. As developer is used it accumulates bromide (and iodide)
from the film. The bromide acts as a restrainer. D-76 has no bromide in it
to start with so the decline in activity with re-use is considerable.
Replenishment can be used to obtain nearly constant activity but there is a
short period at the start of using a freshly mixed developer where there is
a change in the toe contrast due to the accumulation of bromide in the
originally bromide-free developer. Once some bromide is in the mixture the
results can be made pretty stable by controlling the replenishment rate.
  The "seasoner" used for color developers is much the same thing. It is to
start the system out at about the equilibrium rate.
  For use in developing small amounts of film D-76 should be used as a one
shot, diluted to 1:1. The results are very consistent this way. 
  There are alternative versions of D-76 containing some bromide, Agfa-17
being an example.
  In the paper announcing the buffered version of D-76 the authors describe
nearly every variation of D-76 one can think of including the addition of
bromide.
  They found a small amount of bromide, up to 0.5 gram/liter, added to
fresh developer increased effective film speed very slightly due to
suppression of fog, more bromide decreases speed and density, as would be
expected. The Agfa formula adds 0.5gram/liter. 
  Carlton and Crabtree decided the difference wasn't worth adding it. In
any case, where the developer is used in a continuously replenished system
bromide will be accumulated to higher levels than this.

I haven't given much thought to this answer (but that's never stopped me 
before).
I can't imagine how the pH could increase unless it was A:  in contact and 
dissolving a material that was even more basic than the developer or B:  it 
was evaporating.  However, it's been a long day, I'm tired, and certainly 
willing to hear alternative opinions.

  Well, the total time in the fixer is the same wether a single bath or a
split bath is used. The original Ilford paper recommended 30 seconds fixing
time and under a minute at most. It turns out that is not long enough to
fix many paper emulsions, particularly some Kodak emulsions. The emulsions
may clear but the fixing process is not complete.
  The completion of the fixing process is more important than limiting the
amount of thiosulfate bound up in the paper fibers. In fact, most of this
will wash out when paper is treated with a sulfite wash aid and washed for
the usual extended period.
  Also, I have some skepticism about how familiar with the literature the
Ilford researchers were when they did the experiments on this process. They
seem to be trying to wash out all the thiosulfate from the paper, emulsion,
and baryta coating. As pointed out in a previous post some thiosulfate
residue is desirable as an image stabilizer. It is possible to wash too much.
  The problem is getting a controlled amount but the actual amount doesn't
seem to be critical as long as there isn't so much that the thiosulfate
itself starts to attack the image.
  The greatest cause of image degradation is from oxidizers and reducers in
the atmosphere. Prints which are protected from them do not become degraded
even when not toned. However, this sort of protection requires very
expensive archival storage facilities. So, for normal storage conditions
some sort of protection is required. 
  For displayed prints toning is necessary if they are to have any sort of
lifetime. A completely toned print, whether by sulfide, Selenium, or Gold,
is pretty much immune to the effects which destroy silver images. The
problem is that everyone wants completely neutral colored images, which are
hard to generate with enough toning to provide the protection.
  As I said, there is a great deal of conflicting information about
permanence despite the fact that silver-gelatin emulsions have been with us
for one hundred and twenty years.

Shelf life of unopened bottles of HC-110 is practically unlimited.  I had a 
16 oz container for (wild guess) 20+ years before using it and it was fine.

There was some discussion about D-76 and pH changes previously on the  list.
One thought that did come to mind was that atmospheric carbon dioxide could
react with the sodium metaborate  accelerator to shift the buffer system
over to some sodium carbonate (higher pH) and thus change the
characteristics of the developer.  This could occurr if a lot of air was
mixed into the developer solution - excessive stirring when mixing, or if
the developer was stored in plastic (polyethylene) bottles for extended
periods of time.  PE bottles are quite permiable to CO2.  They will keep
oxygen out but will pass carbon dioxide like a screen door.  That is why the
old recommendation of brown glass is still valid in today's plastic world.
I have stored and used D-76 from glass bottles without seeing a significant
change with time - even in replenished developer.  Usually though after
about a  year, I have bid farewell to an old friend and started off with
fresh chemistry.

Thanks much, Garry.  It's a work in progress, and I'm picking up a lot of bits and pieces from this mailing list.  Things
can only get better!  I just picked up an old Pentacon Six and a new funky old camera is always an inspiration.

Have you tried the Efke 100 or 25 film? I am not technically minded enough
to speak of the differences but it creates some beautiful images and is
thick emulsion. I have used about 20 rolls of 120 and like it very much.

If Efke is, as I think it is, the old Adox film made in Croatia, then it is
the same as Jessops own brand, and yes I have used this with my
tanning/staining developer. It stains beautifully, and the tanning is so
great that the film curls into a virtual tube! A very similar film is
Fortpan in 100 and 400 from Silverprint. It has similar stain and curl
characteristics, and the tonality is very much the same too.

Agree with the Irishman... Have a bottle of HC-110 with shop labels 
from Washington State.   Moved from there in 1982.  It's still good. 
(Maybe because it's so thick it can't evaporate?)

Shelf life of unopened bottles of HC-110 is practically unlimited.  I had a 
16 oz container for (wild guess) 20+ years before using it and it was fine.

Barry,
Could you tell us about tonal range and grain? How would you rate it in 
comparison to better known film?
Thanks.

I can second this idea, it works great.  I use HC110 as a one-shot
developer and mix it 500ml at at time.  Visit your local college or univ.
and drop by the chemistry dept.  They can either sell you one, or show you
where to order them.  They are not cheap ($30-$50) but are of high quality.
 Well worth the dollars.  I tried teh syringe route too and the pipettes
are much better.

Many thanks to everyone who replied to my query about verichrome pan film. I will get in touch with B&H and let you know how I get on. If anyone else in the UK has any success please let me know.

Washing prints:
The capacity of 40 10x8 prints per litre of fixer refers to the two bath fixing process.

When large numbers of prints have to be processed the Ilford manual recommends two bath fixing, using Ilford Hypam at 1+9 and fixing the prints for 2 minutes in each bath. When the first bath has fixed the equivalent of 40 10x8 prints it should be discarded and replaced with the second bath, the second bath is then replaced with completely fresh fixer.

The Eddie Ephraums silver print manual recommends discarding the first bath after the equivalent of 25 10x8 prints, and dumping both baths after repeating the sequence four more times.

Michael Spedding.

..I tried the 4*5 ASA version of the 100ASA EFKE, but I had only bad
results, it gives a great stain with Pyro allright, but also a hughe
B+F, wheras FP4 stays very clear at the edges under the same conditions.
With Xtol or D76 I could not push it beyond a density of 1.2, and I
definately needed more for Ziatype and Albumen.

Not to mention that my last 2 boxes were factory pre-exposed..oh well,
as we say in dutch...goedkoop is duurkoop..;-)..

I have pipettes and burettes (old chem. eng.), but I prefer to use a 
properly-sized Pyrex graduate for my HC-110.  Accurate enough, much quicker, 
neater and easier to keep clean.

pure-silver folk -

I am leaving for Asia on business tomorrow.  While I am gone, AT&T claim to be
"upgrading" the network service which connects pure-silver to all of you.
Given their history in this matter, is is quite possible that pure-silver
may be unavailable for minutes, hours, days, or years ;)  

So, if you have something you need to get off your chest, do it well before
2/20/2000

Sorry about that, but hey, whaddya want fer free ;)

Barry,
Could you tell us about tonal range and grain? How would you rate it in
comparison to better known film?
Thanks

I shot a roll of Agfa APX 100 and a roll of Efke R100 in the same
Rolleifles with the same test subjects. I developed both in the same tank
with Rodinal. I could not see any difference between them. However, I did
not do extensive printing of the two.

Hi, my name is Ernest Rice.  I'm the photolab tech for the Jounalism
department at Arkansas State University.  I've been reading your mail for
about 3 weeks and finally have something that's worth asking about.

One of my students in our basic class is a techno weenie as we in the
publishing circles call ourselves, he reads the data sheets and the
newsgroups and gets alot of information without experience.

Anyway, he bought a bunch of chems, paper, and film that I'm not familiar
with.  Now he bought a bulk roll of Tri-x and on his sixth roll he had
something that looks like air dales, the ones I've seen tend to look like
little round places where nothing developed.  His looked more like little
dough nuts, there was developed emulsion in the center with a darker ring.
This film was pushed from 400 to 1600 in extol developer.  Now I have used
quite a bit of Tri-x but haven't gotten around to the extol yet.

Now I'm curious if the doughnut air dales are just because of the pushing(he
knocked them loose eventually)or if it happens with Tri-x and extol.

We have available to the basic students D-76, and once they get used to that
they can use HC-110, and T-Max developers that we have also.  Most of the
film that goes through there is T-max and Ilford HP5+

Ernie

  He just got airbells, has nothing to do with pushing. You might suggest
that he bang the tank a few times and agitate properly. <g>
  It appears that Xtol makes weird-looking airbells, which have a tiny dark
spot in the middle. Odd, but that's what they are.

Hi John and everyone, 

I'm new in the list but know some of you from rec.photo.darkroom. I'm spanish,
from Zaragoza.

John, I think you are missing some variables as lenses, shutter speed, aperture
calibration, flare in your camera, even the area to develop is different and
this also affects the developing process. I have the same problem, I've got an
80 EI for TMX 135 with a Nikon FM2 New and a Nikkor 50mm 1.8 in the most used
shutter speeds, but got a 64 EI for TMX 120 with a Hasselblad 501 C with an 80
mm 2.8 in the same conditions.

I hope this help you.

Regards,

enrique

My 120 negatives certainly 'look' a lot different than the corresponding 35
film.  For one thing, the Base +fog values seem a lot smaller with 120 film.

  Emulsions may or may not be the same in different formats; that depends
on the films. HP5+ is the same in all formats, for example, while 35mm TX
is the same as 120 TX but different than 120 TXP or 4x5 TXP. If in doubt,
consult the film manufacturer.
  Base density is usually different between 35mm and larger formats, 35mm
having significantly more base density. Therefore if you're used to looking
at 35mm negs, 120 negs will look awfully thin until you get used to the
difference.
  If the emulsions are the same, though, curve shape etc should be the same.
  One place an error can creep in is in developing. If you're doing
intermittent agitation with a hand tank, one format may actually receive
somewhat more or less agitation than the other no matter how consistently
you invert the tank.
  To avoid this problem, use either a half-full tank or rotary processing.

I use a small tank 2-35 or 1-120.  On the 35, if developing one roll, i insert 
the second spool.  I fill the tank regardless of film format, typically 14oz.  
Could it be that 35mm/24 has less developer exhaustion, per total area of 
film, than the 120. 
Boy, the variables are endless.  I began reading a book title "The New Zone 
System Manual" last night.  Good book by the way.  Already read AA book 
"Negative".  I needed better clarification on some of AA material. Don't know 
if I will follow some advice in trying to find my EI.  Just not into doing all 
that testing, but I do enjoy reading about the technology/science involved in 
creating something or anything. Enjoy the sciences.

I do like my results of D100/120 shot @64.

  Use a 16 oz (two reel) tank for 35mm and a 32 oz (2x120 or 4x35) for 120.
With the small tank, put the film on one reel and put it on the bottom,
with an empty spacer reel on top. For the big tank, do the same for one
roll of 120 or you can load up to three reels of 35mm.

  _Always include an empty spacer reel on top._

  Use just enough solution to cover the loaded reels. _No more_. For steel
tanks and reels, that's usually 10oz for one 35mm reel or 16oz for one 120
reel. In the case of multiple 35mm reels in the big tank, 8oz per reel will
do it.

  Pour in the developer, bang the tank a couple of times, then invert
continuously for 30 seconds. _Don't be gentle._ An inversion should take up
to two seconds, no more. Thereafter invert the tank twice every 30 seconds.

  Yes, you do want that big slug of air in the tank and all the sloshing
that occurs.

  I can just about guarantee that you're not getting really sufficient
agitation with a full tank.

John is right for D-76, Rodinal, HC-110 and Xtol but you don't want the 
big slug for Pyro- it oxidizes too much which leads to streaking.

     Learning the Zone system really helped improve the quality of my 
work- I shoot almost exclusively on 35mm with a number of bodies and 
lenses. 
     If you go through the process to determine a standard E.I. and 
development time and temperature with just the one setup you use the most 
(in my case it was Tri-X in Rodinal in my OM-4 with 35mm 2.8 attached, 
printed through an ElNikkor 50mm) it gives you a rock to stand on- then 
you can adjust exposures and development for your other gear or films by 
eye/intuition.
You might find that your zoom or after market  lenses have less contrast 
or that a small increase in exposure with your telephoto will yield much 
better detail in the shadow areas of your prints. You'll also know how 
much to alter your development time if you shoot on an overcast day 
instead of a sunny day.

  These sound like typical air-bels (not dales). They are caused by
persistent bubbles which form on the surface of the film and don't come
off. The usual cause is insufficient agitation. It is also recommended that
developing tanks be givin a sharp rap against the bench after filling to
dislodge bubles from the film surface. If you use sheet film racks give
each rack a rap against the side of the tank as you start to agitate. Once
dislodged it is unlikely bubbles will reform. 
  A pre-soak is sometimes recommended as a preventive for air-bels but is
not an absolute one since bubbles can form in the presoak and leave
un-wetted areas of film, a sharp tap is more likely to eliminate them.
  The bubbles prevent developer from getting to the film inside them, thus
leaving an undeveloped area. The lack of reaction products at the edge of
the bubble results in an over-developed ring around it. Air-bels are not
always completly undeveloped, sometimes the bubble will be dislodged
partway through the development leaving a partially developed spot. It may
or may not have a darker ring depending on how long the bubble was there.
  Air bels also tend to form on sheet film which is developed in a tray
with the emulsion facing downward. Any bubbles on the surface will be moved
around by agitation but not removed because the air will trapped there.
  The only time I can remember getting air-bels was when using a Yankee cut
film tank, they are awfull.

  35mm negative film has a dye in the support for the purpose of preventing
light-piping, i.e. the conduction of light through the support sidways.
That is to prevent fogging when the end of the film is exposed to light.
The density of this dye is pretty great, perhaps as great as 0.3 in some
film. It does not decolorize or wash out in processing. 
  It has no effect on printing other than to lengthen the printing time.
  Fog OTOH, affects the toe shape effectively lowering the shadow density
unless enough extra exposure is given to push the shadows up to a point
above the fog level. This is effectively the same as lowering the film
speed. The fog level of most new film is very low.

If anybody is interested, I did contact United Parcel Service on the X-Ray 
issue.  They say they don't usually X-ray packages, but they do reserve the 
right to examine any package.  So if you ship UPS, I don't think there should 
be any problem.  Unless the overseas shipping procedure is different.

I find this really difficult to answer. It's a little like trying to
describe the taste of a wine in words - the cause of much purple prose among
wine writers. About the only thing I can say about it is that the tonality
definitely looks different. A couple of the images in my forthcoming book
have been made on Fortpan and Jessops (the old Adox), and the images work
because of this different 'look'. They are certainly sharp in appearance,
but the grain is prominent. Roughly speaking, I would say that Fortpan 100
and Jessops 100 are roughly equivalent to HP5 Plus or Tri-X 400 speed
emulsion - which is still pretty good of course. I distributed some Fortpan
400 in 120 to participants in a landscape workshop I was running, and the
grain was really too prominent for normal use. There isn't another film that
I can usefully compare any of these films to.
If I am right, by the way, I think that The Jessops emulsion is also known
in some places as Fomapan, but I can't swear to that.
A really useful point about the Jessops film for users of 4x4 TLR cameras
like me is that it is sold at the many Jessops photo stores in the UK in the
now defunct 127 size in a 200 speed emulsion. This is grainy but the extra
area of the 4x4 neg. compared to 35mm makes it acceptable - again  there is
an image from this in my next book.
Another point about film base density plus fog: there's a lot of needless
worry about film fog levels. This doesn't 'submerge' shadow densities in the
negative surely. The negative density is 'on top' of the fog density, and
the fog  just acts like greater film base density. We print through it in
the same way.
Both the Fort and Jessops films do show some base fog in PMK and my own Di
Xactol (though please note that my developer is not a Pyrogallol developer -
it's Catechol plus Glycin), but no more than some more 'modern' films, and
it has no bearing on shadow density and the required exposure for the film.
The stain, however, is rich, yielding especially pleasing tones therefore on
graded papers.
Sorry I can't be more specific. I am afraid that it's a case of 'suck and
see' to find out what it looks like, and whether you like it.

Could you tell us about tonal range and grain? How would you rate it in

Dear Phil.

The reason I could not click on the B&H hot link is that I do not have an internet linked PC. My E.mail is through digital satalite television and does not give me access to attachments or the web.

I sent a fax to B&H yesterday and am now waiting for a reply. In your second E.mail you mention Adorama, do you have a contact address for them also.
Many thanks. Michael Spedding.

Dear Michael:
	B&H and Adorama are both run by Hassidic (sp?) Jews who observe the
Saturday Sabbath, and are closed all day.  The good news is that they
are both open on Sunday (10 to 5), so you should hear back from them
today.  I see in my photo magazines B&H charges 2.19 USD for VP-125,
which is their designation for Verichrome Pan.  Ilford FP4+ is 1.99 for
comparison. (Is that cheaper than in England?)  I have yet to do a side
by side comparison of these two films.
	The other day, I did shoot a roll of Tri-X and a roll of HP5+ under
very similar conditions, then developed each in Xtol 1:2 for the
recommended time.  Holding the two up to the light box, I'd be hard
pressed to tell much difference.  I'll see if anything shows up in the
prints.
	Can you read (see) photo attachments?
	Regards,
	Phil

Victorian magic Lantern shows can be seen here in the UK Given by Philip
Gallop.
of Bristol. He can be contacted through the WCPF pages of The Photographic
Alliance of
Great Britain Handbook.  The slides in Philip's shows are truly fascinating.
Not only
the most incredibly intricate hand colouring, and drawing -not all are
photographs - but
most have mechanical attachments which produce 'moving pictures' and some
extraordinary dissolves, changing daylight scenes to night. He also
demonstrates his
collection of Magic Lanterns and an early projection microscope with some
interesting
slides.
Although not much help to our friends outside the Western Counties of the
UK, it may interest
all to know what the Victorians got up to in the dark!  They were very very
clever, and the more
you learn about the early days of photography, one realises it's the
technology, not ideas that
have improved.
If you can get a show together Pete, it will be certainly be a hit!
Clifford.

Yes Peter

That is exactly how I remember using the paramender.  If you have a geared
tripod,  you can measure the distance between the top of the viewing lens and the
top of the taking lens.  Then after you compose your shot then you just raise the
camera so that the taking lens is in the place of the viewing lens.

Dear Friends of the List, I have recently had the use--without handbook--of a 
Mamiya C220  and 80mm ( Black -newer ) lens, to photograph some close-up 
still life subjects, and have developed a couple of rolls of film. Can anyone 
help me over the following queries that I have as a result. (1.) the results 
are very sharp but slightly lacking in contrast - is this usual with the 
lenses that go with this camera, or is it this particular lens ? (2.) there 
are numbers on the  the bar  alongside the bellows, referring to the various 
lenses that can be used and the amount of extension, and I took them to mean 
the number of STOPS extra needed when extending the bellows. This is 
obviously wrong as my shots are overexposed. (3.) I am trying to  get hold of 
a paramender and wonder how it works-- is there a scale attached to say at 
what distance it is to be used, and are there differing amounts that the 
camera should be raised according to the distance from the subject? I find it 
a very easy and attractive camera to use and would like to get to know more 
about it. Any help gratefully received! Saffron.

I've had a Mamiya C3 many years, though I don't use it much anymore. FWIW
my experience with Mamiya twin-lens lenses is they are very sharp and
contrasty. Your lack of contrast could be the lens, exposure, film,
developer, etc. Unless the lens has some obvious defect, like fungus
inside, I'd suspect one of the latter, perhaps a combination of your
overexposure and underdevelopment. What film/developer/time etc. are you
using? I recall the numbers on the bar you refer to are exposure *factors*,
not stops. I never used them. Instead I either just tweaked the exposure
based on experience or measured bellows draw and figured exposure factor.
The paramender is God's (or Mamiya's) gift to Mamiya users. It works at any
and all distances, the same every time. It sits between the camera and
tripod and raises the camera the precise distance between the lenses at any
angle. The only problem I had with the paramender was forgetting to lower
it before the next exposure! They show up used from time to time on
rec.photo.marketplace, on eBay (if you like overpaying) and at places like
Midwest and KEH. You want the newer Paramender II. I've an old Paramender
I, a bit flakey, which I may consider lending or selling if you're
interested. Hope this helps.

I've had a Mamiya C3 many years, though I don't use it much anymore. FWIW
my experience with Mamiya twin-lens lenses is they are very sharp and
contrasty. Your lack of contrast could be the lens, exposure, film,
developer, etc. Unless the lens has some obvious defect, like fungus
inside, I'd suspect one of the latter, perhaps a combination of your
overexposure and underdevelopment. What film/developer/time etc. are you
using? I recall the numbers on the bar you refer to are exposure *factors*,
not stops. I never used them. Instead I either just tweaked the exposure
based on experience or measured bellows draw and figured exposure factor.
The paramender is God's (or Mamiya's) gift to Mamiya users. It works at any
and all distances, the same every time. It sits between the camera and
tripod and raises the camera the precise distance between the lenses at any
angle. The only problem I had with the paramender was forgetting to lower
it before the next exposure! They show up used from time to time on
rec.photo.marketplace, on eBay (if you like overpaying) and at places like
Midwest and KEH. You want the newer Paramender II. I've an old Paramender
I, a bit flakey, which I may consider lending or selling if you're
interested. Hope this helps.

I used to have 1, loved it & now wonder why I got rid of it. From memory the
paramender is a small device that fits between the camera base & the tripod
top. All it does is raise the camera in small movements to allow for
parallax when using the camera for close-ups. Its not really needed as the
same effect can be obtained by raising the centre post of the tripod. As you
focus close too a line should come down the viewing screen showing the top
of the picture as seen throught the taking lens, & all you need to do is
raise the centre post to where you want the top of the picture to be. Hopes
this makes sense, somewhere I think,I have a book on the camera , so will
try & find it, I am sure there will be a better explanation than mine.

Well, I, too, am going back in time, but that's not the way I remember it at 
all (although, I guess, it could be used that way).  I only used my 
Paramender for close-up work (less than a few feet).  I never used it for 
intermediate settings and don't believe the instructions recommended that.  
The distance between the up and down positions was identical to the distance 
between the center line of the two lenses.  So, for close-up, copystand, etc. 
work, you just set-up everything you wanted to photograph as usual, with the 
Paramender closed, then raised it up to full extension to replace the 
perspective of the viewing lens with that  of the taking lens which, after 
all, is what really counts.  I used it a great deal that way, and recommend 
it to any Mamiya TLR user.

I think I discovered my problem with flat pics.  I develop my negs but do
not print YET.  I use a major chain photo store for B/W prints.  Well, the
stores in Houston send to a local lab for quick turnaround.  A local store
gave me their number and I contacted them so that I could ask some
questions.  To make a long story short, they print on EKTAMAX.  After going
to Kodak web site and reading up on the product, I see they offer only two
type of contrast grade Low and Medium, what a rip off.  This was surely a
learning experience.

Right. Raising the tripod center column works. But the Paramender is much
more elegant as it works at any angle. If the camera is pointed down or up
and you raise the tripod center column you won't raise the camera the
distance between lenses. Which may not matter much when not doing
close-ups; if there's nothing important in the image in the very near
distance; or cropping isn't real precise, say when you're going to crop a
rectangular image from the square.

Hi John,
    Since you are in Houston, you know about the Camera Co/Op.  They usually
have  few modestly priced enlargers for sale.  Check with them.  You should
take a class at one of the Junior Colleges in the area.  Isn't there a club
up in Spring or somewhere that rents darkroom space?  Those guys at the Coop
will know.  Just ask around.
As usual,
Lee Carmichael

B&H have quoted me for 20 rolls of verichrome pan 120 film at 2.19USD per roll, plus shipping costs of 27.25USD.

I think I may go ahead and order these. I will post all the details for anyone who is interested on pure-silver at a later date.

I'm already one up on your suggestion, last year took a darkroom course
offered at Katy. ISD.  Plan to take their advanced course, when available
again.  Thanks for the advice about going to Camera Co/Op for enlargers.
I'm not sure if the Tomball photography club is still around.  Will have to
investigate further.

Hello every body,

    I would like to know if there is some one in France familiar with the
Lith printing process. I started myself Lith technique 6 months ago after I
bought Tim Rudman' book.It is an excellent book with a lot of details and
advises and they are working.
So I would be happy to share some comments or observation.
Many thanks

        Daniel Bouzard   e-mail daniel.bouzard@wanadoo.fr

Careful, the paramender is independent of the tripod
head, so it works all the time. If you just gear up
the head on the tripod the same distance it only works
if the camera is parallel to the column in both axes -
pitch and roll. If there is some tilt to the head then
the taking lens will not be moved into the same
position as the viewing lens. Bubble levels don't give
you the whole picture because if the legs are tilted
then the head must be tilted as well. It will work if
you have a level on both the tripod body and the head.

My own pair Mamiya 330s and a 220 had particularly contrasty lenses, and
that is a feature too of the work that I have processed for other users of
this camera. I also remember there being an f3.7 four element 'budget' lens
for the 220 which was a super high contrast performer which wowed the lens
testers in the 1970s. I well remember a test where it outperformed a 3.5
Planar in a comparatively tested Rollei TLR.
Is there any fungus in the lens of your camera, or has somebody been too
enthusiastic in polishing the front or rear element?

Dear Friends of the List, I have recently had the use--without handbook--of
a
Mamiya C220  and 80mm ( Black -newer ) lens, to photograph some close-up
still life subjects, and have developed a couple of rolls of film. Can
anyone
help me over the following queries that I have as a result. (1.) the results
are very sharp but slightly lacking in contrast - is this usual with the
lenses that go with this camera, or is it this particular lens ? (2.) there
are numbers on the  the bar  alongside the bellows, referring to the various
lenses that can be used and the amount of extension, and I took them to mean
the number of STOPS extra needed when extending the bellows. This is
obviously wrong as my shots are overexposed. (3.) I am trying to  get hold
of
a paramender and wonder how it works-- is there a scale attached to say at
what distance it is to be used, and are there differing amounts that the
camera should be raised according to the distance from the subject? I find
it
a very easy and attractive camera to use and would like to get to know more
about it. Any help gratefully received! Saffron.

The lower contrast is likely a result of the overexposure, not the lens.

Needed some small diffusers this Sunday.

Picked up 10" and 12" embroidery hoops at Wal-Mart.
The 10's were plastic and ran $1.45US, and the bamboo 12" was a whopping 0.59.
A yard of stretchy plain white nylon of some kind was $5. 
Enough left over for double or triple thickness if needed.
No fuss. Snap the rings over the material, fast trim with scissors and  'viola!".

Pliers aligned my genuine coathanger accessory holders to perfect harmony in front of the lamps.

The same trick works for a diffuser to hold under your enlarger lens when printing.  I would go with
black rather that white nylon.  Great for removing wrinkles, and grain, too.

Ed,

Same cheap trick but different luxurious looking effect... a diffuser in
front of the camera lens "bleeds" the highlights into the shadows - but a
difuser under the enlarging lens bleeds the negative's shadows into the
highlights.

Well after reading all the e-mails about PMK Pyro I'm about to take the 
plunge.  I ordered the Pyro from Eight Elm Photo in Toronto (Ontario, 
Canada) along with a box of Ilford FP4.  I normally shoot Ilford Delta 100 
(4x5) and while I was told the Delta 100 would be adequate for Pyro I was 
told that the older films (ie FP4) would be better.  Unfortunately, they 
are temporarily out of Gordon's book and I could not check the development 
times.  Could someone tell me the development time for the FP4 developed in 
a dip tank.  I would also like to know the time for tray processing.  I 
have always processed sheet film in a dip tank but if tray processing (or 
roller drum) will yield better results (or equal so I use less chemistry) I 
would switch.

Regards,

Chris

I haven't done dip tank...

For years,I  use Jobo CPA2 with expert tank to develop films with PMK
and I try different dilutions according to some suggestions that I found
over newgroups and in the Book of Pyro( mainly I use HP5+ and some TMY)

I always get,no matter what I did,quite high yellow stain on the film
base+fog

Finally,I tried using tray and develop films one sheet only each time
I don't get any yellow stain at all !(I mean the film base+fog is as clear
as it should
,they are image stain,of course.)

I now use tray,though it takes longer to develop each sheet of film and can
only
develop one sheet each time(in Jobo,I can do 4 sheets at once)

I would suggest at least develop film with PMK in tray once or two to get
an idea what you will get from single sheet tray development with PMK and
use
it to compare with other menthod....


PS:Yes, I also tried Roll Pyro in different dilutions with Jobo, single
sheet in tray
still is better,in my opinion.

Everyone -

This is a brief commercial for our new StopClock Professional enlarger
timer.  This is an f-stop timer with ultrafine resolution down to 1/24 stop
(1%), storage for exposure sequences of up to 20 steps, and a "dry-down
button" which can be used to adjust exposure times to compensate for print
dry-down and/or subsequent toning processes.  This unit provides the
ultimate in control for fine printing!

For full details please visit our web site: http://www.rhdesigns.co.uk
(The specific page is http://www.rhdesigns.co.uk/SCPro.htm)

For those in the UK, the unit (together with our whole range) will be on
show at the Focus on Imaging exhibition at the NEC, 27th Feb - 1st March,
on the Nova Darkroom Equipment stand.  I'll be pleased to meet any list
members there!

Best wishes
Richard Ross

All

At the risk of starting an e-mail storm with 999,999 replies, we have a
subjective question comparing MF Japanese with MF German lenses.  

In order to get the quality we want from monochrome prints (typically up
to 11" x 14") of both landscape and general subjects, we are thinking of
investing in some MF equipment.  As Barry Thornton comments in his book
'Elements' there is doubt in our minds too if going to 6 x 4,5 is a big
enough increase in negative area compared with the 35mm Leica gear that
we currently use.  We are thinking hard about 6 x 6 but have not
eliminated 6 x 4,5.  As serious amateurs, cost is a consideration and we
are considering Mamiya or Hesselblad/Rollei.

Does anyone have practical experience on comparison of the performance
of Mamiya lenses with say the Hasselblad CB-lenses please ?  We don't
yet understand the Rollei lenses.  As a comment, we noticed a
significant increase in quality when previously moving from Nikon prime
lenses to the Leica gear - not quite like Night and Day (Chalk and
Cheese in the UK) but still worthwhile.

Regards
Malcolm & Sylvia

FWIW - I've tray developed 4X5 sheets in multiples for 40 years. Not in Pyro or any of the exotics, but the principle should be the same. All film in the same direction and orientation,
fan them in your left hand, grab the first sheet  with the thumb and forefinger of your right hand, drop it gently flat into the center of the tray, submerge it with your little finger, drop the next sheet.
Usually do 6 at time. Once they are all wet, carefully 'shuffle' bottom to top. As long as you don't jab a corner across the emulsion, you should have no problem.

Chris,

If you have difficulty obtaining Gordon's "Book of Pyro" (and I know that he
has almost sold-out on the latest 3rd Ed) then I can supply from stock.
However, as I am in the UK I have to charge extra air-mail postage so can
only supply a copy for US$35 - which is about $3 more than Gordon supplies
for from sunny CA. Let me know if I can help... I could have one in your
hands in 7 days.

BTW: For other lurkers having difficulty in obtaining this book I have
another 8 copies for sale.

Cheers,

Sylvia, I have done a lot of work with 35mm, Leica and others, 645 Fuji,
6X6, Rollei, and 6X9 Fuji. I do don't entirely accept your premise that
Leica negs are inadequate at 11X14, but, it is your subjective opinion.
That being said, 645 is a big increrase in potential quality over 35mm. At
16X20, my favorite size for color prints, 645 is far ahead. The larger
sizes add more potential quality and the Fuji GSW 690 is a "Texas Leica".
That camera preserves the aspect ratio of 35mm with a view equivalent to a
28m lens on a Leica. Fuji optics are superb. That's my experience. Best
regards, Bill Lawlor

Hiya Sylvia,

I hope you're enjoying Sunny CA better than the Wet UK you moved from last
year.

To add a comment to your question though... you have used 35mm
extensively... are considering 6x4.5... and planning making prints up to
14x11 inch in size. One thing links those three, and it isn't a "square"
format. Consider the Pentax 67 system... it is *very* reasonably priced, has
wonderfully sharp lenses, is plentiful on the used market and produces a
large negative which only requires enlarging x5 to make the print size you
hanker after. Also, because it handles like an overgrown 35mm, and at
eye-level, you won't have to learn a new shooting technique (like 6x6 at
waist -level)... only to find that it's one you don't like.

I've owned and used the P67 system twice in the past 20 years and am
considering returning to it rather than continuing with large-format... like
you propose I rarely enlarge bigger than 12x16 and so never exceed the
capabilities of the films I'm using. As for 6x4.5, I've used them and find
their advantages over 35mm relatively minor compared with the advantages of
6x7 over 35mm. 

Another thing... unusually, Mamiya in the States is *more* expensive than on
this side of the pond (in "rip off Britain") but with Pentax 67 you have the
price advantage.

Just my 0.02,

The Rollei Zeiss lenses (600x) are the same optics as hasselblad, but
with a electronically governed shutter.  The older (HFT, non-PQ and
non-PQS)
lenses are a lot less expensive but generally the same glass. The
difference is the PQ lenses allow full-aperture metering, and the 
PQS have a faster top speed.

 There are also expensive Schneider lenses in some focal lengths.

I think that 11x14 enlargements from full negatives would not be
a stretch for 6x4.5 or 6x6.   (obviously you would be cropping from
6x6 so there would not be so much difference in film area).
I agree that many people would find 11x14 from 35mm somewhere
at the edge of acceptable.
The 6x9cm negative size gives you a LOT of film for 11x14; as
is the case for much of equipment decisions there is a tradeoff.
In this case, other than the obvious additional film cost, there
is a risk that you will have the potential for more
problems with the flatness of the film.

Although I am happy with one Fuji (a 645folder) optically, I agree
that it would not be likely to help you to get subjective
opinions on German/Japanese lens characteristics. The advantage
of this camera is that it is small/light compared to most MF
and some 35mm.

Just a point Richard. I have used 6x6 in a Rollei SL66 for many years with
complete satisfaction ever since I realised that you don't have to crop it
to rectangular. That's just another of those old photographic wives' tales!
(Is that sexist? Should I say 'Old married persons' tales'?)Just compose and
print square. As soon as I tried working square, I found composition was
natural and easy compared to my work with rectangular formats. This in turn
means you don't have turn the camera for portrait/landscape format. The
portrait upright format of 6x4.5 cameras I have found to be a major hang-up
when I have tried it for landscape, and I have observed that other users of
the format attending my workshops have found 6x4.5 to be a hassle. It means
you do have to use a prism finder to be practical. With 6x6, you can use
either a prism or waist level finder to choice.

I agree, but somewhere 11x14 was mentioned. 

The Fuji 645 is a rangefinder, so turning it sideways is no
hassle.  For what it is worth, with this camera
I occasionally find myself taking 2 photos, vertical and horizontal,
when I would
otherwise take only one square exposure. In other cases (e.g. distant
landscapes)
I find the square format ends up cropped much of the time.  Too
many photo opportunities seem to give you a swath of blurry foreground 
or perhaps too much sky.

I have used Mamiya (in several varieties), Fuji, and Hasselblad MF gear.  It is 
all very good.  I ended up with a Hasselblad at the end of the day, because their
optics are just breathtaking.  However, the difference between the three brands
cited is not huge.

The big improvement comes from the larger negative.  Even an average old Mamiya
C TLR lens will outperform the best Leica lenses at some level of final print
magnification.  This is a matter of physics - no (practical) 35mm system, no matter
how good the optics, can overcome the disadvantage of the smaller format.  This
becomes noticeable at large magnifications.  I see signficant differences
between the two formats on 11x14 prints.  I see huge differences at 16x20.

For the record, 4x5 is better again in this regard because of the larger neg size.
It is also possible (via an old used Speed Graphic or monorail view camera) to enter this
format very inexpensively.  Moreover, the lenses for 4x5 are typically much cheaper
than the current crop of MF lenses.  Consider that a 72mm Schneider SA XL can be had
new for under US $2000, but a 40mm Distagon for a Hasselblad is over US $4000, for
example.

I considered this camera very carefully myself (I love the 67 format) & I 
agree with all the comments ststed above, except for the handling....true 
it's 35mm style in layout, but it is "very heavy" & takes some getting use to 
handling this camera.

  Remember that if you do things "right" you'll be carrying around just as
much weight of equipment, just as big a tripod, still taking forever to set
up, compose a shot and carefully focus...and then wishing for a little
front rise and back tilt. <G>
  Lately I've become infatuated with the 2x3 view cameras, almost to the
point of buying a Galvin on ebay. I like the notion of movements in a
fairly small package.

That's an understatement...that shutter noise is awful, made me consider the 
Mamiya 7. Not as versatile, but very light, quiet, sharp lenses, easy to 
handle..only downfall for me is no ability to focus in tight (like the P67 & 
a 135 for example).

still prefer the Mamiya though

Cheers,

Nah,  my Pentacon Six syncs at 1/25.  But what the heck, a body, two nice Zeiss
lenses and a prism for just under $400,  you can forgive the some of the quirks.

Frederic,

Initially I felt the same about the P67... but when I added the dedicated
left-hand-side wooden grip it transformed the handling in both landscape and
portrait alignment.

Hi John,

Your last line is actuall my problem... although it is unfair under the
circumstances for me to call it such. Trish has MS and cannot get around
without my arm and shoulder to lean on. I tried lugging the 8x10, then 5x7,
around on the free shoulder... but the prospect of the two of us under a
dark cloth would have made folks talk a lot... *and* worried the sheep in
this area of Wales!  8-0

I do use the big one indoors though, and have reverted almost totally to
Leica M3/50 Summicron for outdoor use, but I think I need a compromise
solution for my free shoulder.

Cheers,

I reviewed the Mamiya 7 recently. I liked the camera and the great lenses
but didn't like the viewfinder meter reading display or the camera's
shutter... too quiet in most environments with any background noise (like
small children <g>) so I often didn't know *exactly* when the thing had
fired. Also found the shutter release *very* light resulting in too many
shots made before the camera had even been focused. However, some of those
points are corrected with user-experience of more than the couple of weeks I
used it.

I haven't held one in my hand, but I'm told that the Mamiya 7 doesn't
focus closely enough with the 150mm lens to get a tight head shot
portrait.  Advantage Pentax. (Actually, I'm using a Mamiya C330 with the
180.)

Ed,

I did try it with the handle, but found it tough to handle, although better. 
My problem at the time was that working a lot of hrs at the computer had put 
a strain on my arms (a touch of tendinitis) which did not help...& the P67 
would aggravate it.

Cheers,

Frederic

In my Mamiya 6MF, there's a little LED that lights when the shutter has
fired, in case you don't hear it.  Presumably the 7 has this as well?  My
only complaint about the 6 (apart from Mamiya launching the 7 about a month
after I bought it ...) is the usual rangefinder problem - remembering to
take the lens cap off - "What you see is what you would have got ...."  :-)
All three lenses are superb though IMHO.

Regards
Richard

I had a Pentax 67 for several years. I started with the 105/2.4 lens and
bought a new 55mm lens. The lenses were superb in every way I can imagine.
All the rest of the system was a collection of compromises as has been
mentioned in this thread. A big one that has not been mentioned, I
believe, is the combined syhuute and mirrot shake problem. There is a lot
of mass moving when you release the shutter. Later models have miror lockup
which helps but still the big focal plane shutter movement remains. It
required a good solid tripod and the pressure of your hands to mkeh sharp
pics at speds of 1/60 or lower. I used the hat trick for long exposures,
put a hat over the lens-open shutter with B-time with a watch-cover the
lens-close shutter. It works but this is the year 2000!

When preparing for a trip around the world last year I realized I couldn't
haul that heavy kit. I took a leica m6 and fuji rangefinder GS646S.

A camera that has not been mentioned is the Rollei TLR. Excellent optics,
leaf shutter, reasonable prices for used Planar models.

Yes that's right. With the 150, you get approx waist up shots. Thta's not 
very tight for a portrait lens. The lens does have a nice look to it though & 
the flare is well suppressed


Cheers,

Frederic

Ed,

One advantage with the shutter is the electronic release which makes it so 
smooth. You are able to get slow speed, hand held shots with ease. The 
shutter is much smoother in this regard to my Leica. 

The problem with the Mamiya 7 for me is the lack of close focusing ability & 
the slower lenses, although the film format allows for faster speed film & 
the smooth shutter does allow one to make up for the slow lenses.

Re the MF thread ......

So far no one has mentioned Bronica MF - let me be the first ! 

Over the last 16 years or so I have found the Bronica 6x6 and  6x45 cameras
to be very useful  for landscape work, with the 6x45 ETRS / ETRSi  being the
most portable. I have to admit that I have given various Bronicas an amazing
amount of abuse in the field and I haven't been let down by one yet! I now
mainly use an ETRSi with a rotary finder which  makes the camera nowhere
near as heavy as one fitted with metered prism head.  OK, I also need to use
a separate meter but that's a much better approach anyway ! I also have a
Beattie screen fitted which provides very bright viewing in difficult
lighting situations (or with a red filter on for mono infrared work). I can
thoroughly recommend a Beattie screen for any camera - the improvement in
brightness is staggering. 

IMO the Bonica's optics are well up to the biz and as they have silky smooth
in-the-lens Seiko leaf shutters vibration problems are not usually
encountered. The later Bronicas also feature a mirror lock-up facility. But,
by far the most useful feature is the easy-to-use interchangeable back
system. Spare backs are light to carry and on a long walk this matters.  I
have also found that the ETRS / i  is quite workable from a light tripod (
the one you use for your 35 mm gear will probably do ) so this also helps
when walking and cutting down on weight.  On field trips with the ETRSi I
usually take along at least two spare backs with different film combos
pre-loaded.  Switching between colour , mono or infrared work is a doddle.
This makes a one body + a few lenses and backs set-up a very versatile MF
option.  

Any one else have views / experience with Bronicas ? 

Anyway,  that's the way I find then - and use em' ! 

All the best for now,

Neil Souch.

Thanks to everyone who so kindly  wrote re. the C220.. I have now have full 
instructions from photonet.demon,-- a load of interesting info. on the whole 
system from the Patterson site, and have just been in the darkroom printing 
from a new set of (properly exposed) negatives and am very pleased with the 
results. The lens is in very good condition, no scratches or fungus, Barry, I 
am glad to say,and I also managed to get a paramender which is indeed a 
simple and elegant answer to the parallex question. (The C220 does not have 
the line which comes up the focus screen which is on the 330, I believe, but 
has engraved lines instead. ) I can't help thinking that anyone on a budget 
who wanted to go into MF would get a bargain with this system. I was 
interested your comments on the 180mm lens for portraits, Phil, what distance 
are you for the tightly cropped portrait shot? I was thinking of adding a 
portrait lens at some stage. Saffron.

I have used the Kiev 60 since december and found the lenses to be great. I
paid $560 for the body 2 viewfinders and 3 lenses 30ff fisheye, 45 and 80. I
understand that there are decent telephoto lenses available as well as
schnider german lenses that will fit it.

They made 3 different lenses that you could use for portraits.  My personal
preference is the 135 it is an all around portrait lens.  I used my mine for
years without one complaint.  There is 2 different versions of the 105 lens, the
one which is marked 105DS  is unique, it has a shutter in both viewing and taking
lenses.  That way you can actually see the effect that the aperture is having on
the image while composing.  I used one of these for a long time, because the last
studio I had was on the small side, and the 105 was just long enough to keep that
portrait perspective and still get a full length shot.  The 180 is a great long
portrait lens.  I liked it what I was doing environmental shoots out of doors, it
lets you be a little further away from the subject while throwing the background
way out.
The only thing that I found about these lenses was that Mamiya did not have good
quality control, and the different examples of a focal length can run from bad to
excellent.   I always bought lenses with a testing period and return option.

I have a pair of 10 year old SQA's one is a SQAM, they get hammered (about 
100+ rolls per month and apart from the battery cover on the SQAM which 
always falls off because the retaining clip is not long/man enough they have 
faired very well.  Early backs are a pain though because there is no 
interlock and one can merrily shoot away with the darkslide still in place 
and while I am on minor whinges I just wish there was a nice home for the 
darkslide.  I am always misplacing the accursed thing.  Mind you I seem to 
misplace most things so maybe this is not a Bronica problem, just me!

For vertical-only applications (camera looking right ahead) I believe the
distance between
the center axis of the TLR lens is 50mm.

Marten,

100 + rolls through your SQA's a month is heady going. Good to
hear the cameras can take that sort or work ! 

I used a SQA for a few years and got on with it very well. I hardly
ever do a square pic so I eventually moved to ETRS's . The are
lighter to walk with and there are plenty of good S/H items around
that haven't had pro use . 

The battery cover has not so far caused me any problems but that 
may be because I keep a quick-release tripod plate on the base of 
my cameras most of the time.

I haven't done anything silly withthe dark slide as yet and usually
keep mine in my filter pouch. 

Good to hear from you - thanks.

Neil Souch

In yesterday's NY Times there is an ad offering B/W prints from the Time's 
archives.  

They are offered as "archival fiber-based, silver-gelatin prints...."
I thought the terms "Fiber-based" and "Silver-gelatin" were mutually 
exclusive.  A print could be fiber-based or it could be silver-gelatin, but 
not both.  Isn't silver-GELATIN a fancy way of saying Resin Coated?

	No. What they're offering is traditional b&w prints on fiber paper.

Both fibre based and RC prints use a silver based emulsion in getatin.  The
difference between the two is that RC papers have a thin coating of plastic
(polyethylene ?) between the gelatin based emulsion and the paper base.

Both conventional film and paper are silver gelatin emulsions.  This is
a typical designation from the art world, where there are many media,
such as water color on rice paper or acrylic on canvas.  With the growth
of digital media and various forms of output from printers, I think
we're going to see more of this, to distinguish what we photographers
call a "print" from other kinds of output.  The good news is that
calling it "silver gelatin" immediately commands a higher price!

It's a way to distinguish from other photographic processes: platinum/
palladium, bromoil, carbon, etc... which are also photographic prints.

Hi All

Thanks very much for your helpful comments on our Subjective MF question
last week, which started off about comparing German with Japanese lens
optics and inevitably incorporated format views.  All of your inputs
which are too many to individually mention, were very much appreciated
and most valuable.

Yes Ed, we are very much enjoying Sunny CA more than the wet UK we moved
from last year.  Tim's comments that the difference between the three
brands cited is not huge but then it seems that John's wife remembers
how he justified the 8x10.....

Your suggestion to look at a Mamiya 6 is helpful Andrew.  As suggested
by Dirk Wright and another writer (sorry we lost the e-mail) we got a
lot out of checking out:
http://www.photodo.com/templates/display.lasso?show=489

Richard's observation on "What you see is what you would have got ...."
amused us but have never had this problem with our M6s - yet anyway :-)

Still, we did wander down to the local camera store on Saturday and
scare a few children (and ourselves) by firing the shutter on a Pentax
P67.  We are going to hire a Hasselblad for the weekend to judge for
ourselves and also visit the San Jose camera fair in a few weeks, so who
knows.

Thanks again everyone.

Regards
Sylvia and Malcolm
