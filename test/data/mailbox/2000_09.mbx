That will surely be an article worth reading. I think
everyone is waiting with baited breath. In teh mean
time I think that a $10 8 oz bottle of brown toner
will go a long way at 1:200 dilution.

Nothing is archival if the building is burning down!

P.S. If anyone out there has any experinece in using
Kodak Brown Toner at the recommended 1:200 dilution
I'd love to hear what sort of image changes you get.

I don't know :-)

But as I understand, read somewhere long time ago, TMX is
the film based on AA's dream (later took over by John Sexton
when AA is gone), a film has long characteristic straight line,
precise control, easy to N+/N- ...etc.

I believe TMX also been designed to match what human's eye
see the world( previsualization ?)  TMax is LESS BLUE-SENSTIVE
than traditional films for the reason that it makes photographers won't
need always put a yellow filters on lens to render tonal range 'normal'

 I believe there is nothing to do with modern emulsions has 'strange' filter
response, but just Tmax is designed that way.

The less-blue sensitivity also is the reason why most people expose for
Zone III 1/2 on shadow instead Zone III ,because, usually, shadow area
tend to have cooler color temperture (blue) which Tmax not sensitive to.
a little more exposure then become necessary.

A week or two ago, someone here mentioned their use of a Wess punch registration
system for creating contrast masks.  I just got the Wess catalog and am unclear
on which product to use (I want to do this from 35mm all the way through
4x5) and how it is actually used.

Could the resident expert(s) chime in here, please?

bulldog clips with a paper clip hook to hang his up.  What is your favorite

  Don't use it at this dilution! Polysulfide toners have a peculiar
characteristic; they tone _faster_ as they are diluted. When used very
diluted the toner becomes uncontrolable and leaves peach or yellow stains
in the highlights. Washing must be done carefully too since it is diluting
the toner. If not washed rapidly enough the toner can still cause highlight
staining. A stop bath of _stock_ Kodak wash aid is suggested to help
prevent staining.
  More when I get it, I've sent a bunch of questions to Doug and am waiting
for his reply. 
Have patience, some of this stuff is information I've been searching for
for ten years.

  Carbon prints are beautiful and full scale (unlike Platinum).  Monochrome
carbon prints are not too hard to make (three  or four color is a mess).
  Wilhelm tested under normal gallery display conditions. The 500 year
number is on display under dim light for 12 hours a day.
  The colorants in Carbon prints are pigments rather than dye or metal so
they can be chosen for immunity to peroxides etc., in the air. The drawback
to carbon is that it is in a gelatin carrier so has the same problems with
bacteria, mold, etc., that silver prints do.
  While Platinum/Paladium prints are often cited for very long life there
can be problems with them too. Platinum is itself pretty non-reactive but
is a good catalyst for many reactions. It can cause reactions which break
down the paper support under certain conditions. So can traces of the
clearing bath. Simply being a Platinum print is no guarantee of permanence.

  I use Paterson plastic film clips, the kind that have a couple of spikes
and are really intended for rollfilm. The spike will leave a hole in a
corner of the neg, but the negs definitely aren't going to fall on the floor.

Sahnnon,

>  What is your favorite
> way?

I made my own drying cabinet and used threaded rods to attach plastic cloths
pins. The pins have an 'S' hook on the tab which allows the pins to be hung
on the threaded rod. Each of the pins is about 2 inches in length and has
raised ribs on the inside surfaces that "grab" the film. I hanf the film at
one corner slightly past the wide rebate. The film hangs firmly in the grip
of the pin but after drying there is only a slight dimple on the emulsion
side of the film, much better IMO than a pierced dimple.

The pins work just as well with roll film too.

I use plastic clothes pins.  I have seen wooden ones stuck to the film.  The
clothes pins that I use were a Wal Mart item.  I have seen some that curve too
much at the tip.  these have a set of three griping stripes.

They are attached to small wooden dowels which can be easily removed for roll
film.

There used to be a special wooden clothespin made just for this purpose -
it had a metal clip on one side for easily hanging and removal from a line.
These are no longer made AFAIK, but I was able to get a fistfull of them
at one point.  Failing this, I recommend normal old clothespins.

I think perhaps I found the best thing this side of a drying cabinet - a hanger
purchase at a "Everything a $1" store.  It is made of plastic and I think was
originally designed to hang women's hosiery or maybe men's socks.  I can hang 12
4x5 negs at one time.

Have a good day,
Jerry Brown

Hi Jerry:
         I use wooden clothes pins.  I have talked to several dentists and 
all I have talked to have converted to automatic processors.  These seem to 
have driers built in.

  I am another who uses plain spring clothes pins. You can fasten cup hooks
to the tops of the pins so that they will hang with the film perpendicular
to the cord, allows hanging more film (or prints) in a given space. 
  I've also seen plastic clothes pins with large hooks to fit a shower
curtain rail. These also have the jaws in line with the hook.
  Don't dry film in sheet film hangers. Water is trapped in the grooves and
tends to leak out as the film is drying leaving streaks.

When you use normal clothespins, do you pin the film to a metal rod, or to
monofilament or what?  At the University of Houston, our drying cabinet has
metal rods in it.  If you use clothespins to pin sheet film to them, it
sort of bends the film, and they don't stay on very well.  You would have
to attach a hook or something to the clothespin to make it hang on the rod
right.

I used to use small bulldog clips until I lost one of my best negs in 
between the washing machine and the sink... I've never been too good at the 
old housework 'thing' so the neg got covered and scratched with all sorts of 
gunk. From then on I switched to some cheap clips I found in the 
supermarket. It's a large peg with a hook attached to the top. I'm sure it 
was meant for some house wife-y purpose, but is perfect for films.

Chaps and Chapesses

We seem to be plagued with a small number of occasional random small
white soft edged round blemishes on our prints.  We believe them to be
originating from the negative (note the soft edges) and would welcome
any advice on what these might be due to and how to avoid them in
future.  They do not appear on every frame but always of course on the
best ones and in the most critical spots.

These white blemishes seem to be independent of film type and developer
combinations used.  We develop, stop, fix and then wash as usual in a
Patterson spiral tank inverting and tapping the tank to dislodge air
bubbles.  The water used has been through a water softener and a reverse
osmosis filter system.

Any advice on the likely cause would be very much appreciated.  Spotting
is not our strong point.

Regards
Malcolm

  Inspect the negatives to see if you can find the cause. It may be calcium
deposits. If so they can often be removed by soaking the film in acetic
acid stop bath (fresh) for a few minutes and swabbing carefully with cotton
balls. Acetic acid will dissolve much mineral matter. Then rewash the film
for five minutes. After washing treat in a mixture as follows:
Distilled water				1 liter
91 to 99% Isopropyl alcohol		25 ml
Kodak Photo Flo				2.5 ml

You can get the Isopropyl at the drugstore. Rubbing alcohol can be used
provided its just alcohol and water, not the stuff with oil of wintergreen,
etc., in it. You must use a little more as it is only 70% alcohol. 
  The Photo-flo is half recommended strength.
  Let the film soak in this for about two minutes and hang to dry without
squeegeeing. The alcohol combines with the Photo Flo to form a super
wetting agent. 
  This final rinse should be used routinely.
  If distilled water is hard to get try boiling water for about three
minutes and cooling. This will eliminate most dissolved gasses (including
oxygen and chlorine) and precipitate much solid matter.
  Vinegar (acetic acid) and salt is a good combination for cleaning mineral
deposits off of pots and kettles.

Thank you very much for your advice.  I/we will try out your suggestion
and report our findings.  The blemishes are so small that I am not sure
if we will be able to see them on the negative but we sure will try.

Is it likely that calcium has been deposited though since we are using
softened and filtered water ?  We used to live in a hard water area in
the UK so know what it is like but this is super soft water that we are
using and there are never any traces of calcium deposits anywhere else
from this water.

Regards
Malcolm

Malcolm,  Be sure that your water is not too soft.  While it is true that hard
water and all that it has in it are not good, over softening can also be a
problem.

Apologies for late reply but after returning from hols. I had 250 + e-mails
from pure silver to read through plus 40 sheets of 5 x 4 to dev. and produce
working prints from. Almost done.

I agree that my Beattie screen is much better to focus with than the etched
screen originally supplied with my 50 year old MPP. Etched screens have
cylindrical holes normal to the screen surface which cause light fall off in
the corners as they are so far out of angular alignment with the incoming
rays.A decent piece of glass roughened using car valve grinding paste does a
better job than an etched screen and costs about 50 pence UK.

A darkcloth is a must for most situations although for some work I can focus
without any aid but this depends on the position of the sun and general
lighting conditions.

I have made my own darkcloth from white blackout material. It has four holes
cut in it to go over the movement lock knobs and has velcro fitted such that
I can wrap it around the camera, over the knobs and close it with the velcro
underneath. No elastic is required. This gives a complete tunnel and blocks
out virtually all light. It also leaves both hands free for adjustments and
the knobs exposed for loosening/ tightening plus focus etc. Works well and
is smaller than commercial items to save weight and bulk for backpacking.
Also as its white it acts as a fill on occassion. The length rearwrds is
minimum to go over my head and allow me to focus using vari focal
glasses-age does creep up on one.

Hope this helps.

Regards

JR

I'm not sure I fully understand the need for glass negative =
carriers-which by the way are seriously expensive for the LPL 7451 =
enlarger.
Glass surely will always give problems of cleanliness and Newton rings.

More to the point is that the depth of FOCUS for any lens is easy to =
calculate as it is independant on focal length.
At f16 its 0,7mm, f22 it's 1,3mm, f32 it's 2,7mm, f45 it's 5,4mm and f64 =
it's 11mm.=20
So,say, with the enlarger lens on f22 the negative will have to have a =
bow of more than 1,3mm to give focus problems. This amount of bow would =
be clearly visible and would indicate an unusual problem certainly for 5 =
x 4 negatives which I generally use.

As a matter of interest these same values can be used when focussing on =
near and far points of interest with the camera to determine f stop to =
give sharpness over areas of interest.

  Hi Wendy
  I don't know which Meopta enlarger you have, but they are a good =
choice made for practical use, not just good looks (in fact, not even =
good looks!). I have a Meopta Magnafax for daily professional use for =
over 10 years now. Very little has gone wrong. Meopta enlargers are =
sturdy and have some good adjustments for lens/negative stage alignment =
or for deliberate distortion from square with the baseboard using the =
Scheimflug principle (if you ever want to get into that sort of thing).
  An important point - make sure the negative carrier is used with =
glasses, not the glassless inserts, otherwise you will not get properly =
sharp pictures. Meopta make a very full range of very reasonably priced =
parts and accessories. Negative carrier glasses and masks for all neg. =
sizes are readily available. The best combination is a lower glassless =
mask, and an upper anti-Newton's rings glass. The accurate rangefinder =
built into the Meopta negative carrier is only accurate, though, if you =
use either both glasses, or both glassless masks. Not if you you use the =
hybrid method I suggest
  You can also fit a 6x9 light box to the head and use this for all =
smaller negative sizes. there is ample light output, and the light =
coverage is very even this way.
  The filters in the Meopta Colour head use the Agfa standard of =
filtration.
  Unfortunately, Ilford do not show combinations of Agfa filters that =
give 'constant speed' printing as they do with the Kodak and Durst =
standard filters used with most other enlargers. What this means is that =
you would have to make another test strip to check proper print exposure =
if you change contrast grade. Actually, the claims for the 'constant =
speed' of the other types are overblown, and you would need new test =
strips with these too, though the change in exposure time would tend to =
be less.
  So here are the filter values to set using Ilford Multigrade paper - =
not a bad place to start because the standard, warm and cool tone =
options with this paper.
  Grade 00 - 150 yellow; grade 0 - 90 yellow; grade =BD - 70 yellow; =
grade 1 - 55 yellow; grade 1=BD - 30 yellow; grade 2 - no filters; grade =
2=BD - 20 magenta; grade 3 - 40 magenta; grade 3=BD - 65 magenta; grade =
4 - 85 magenta; grade 4=BD - 200 magenta. You do not have enough =
strength in magenta filtration to achieve grade 5. In fact I think you =
only get 180 magenta with the Meopta colour head, so you cannot actually =
get true grade 4=BD. However, this is still pretty hard contrast with =
Ilford paper and should be enough for your needs.
  The cyan filter has no effect whatsoever on paper contrast grade, but =
you can use it as a neutral density filter to reduce light output for =
small prints and thin negatives.
  You should be aware that Meopta make a really effective Variable =
Contrast head at a very reasonable price, but which lacks nothing over =
heads of many times the price. It has stepless grades from 0 - 5 with =
Ilford paper, an instant white light lever, and stepless but calibrated =
variable neutral density up to 2 stops to adjust the length of exposure =
time to one that is convenient for working with the print in hand. The =
grade settings, accurate for Ilford, aren't quite right for Agfa paper, =
but are so close that it makes no difference.
  For other papers with greatly different grade filters, you can use the =
split grade  printing approach which others prefer as standard, but I =
don't unless I have to.
  =20
  Hope this helps Wendy.

I simply use plastic clothes pegs at one corner of the negatives such that
they hang diagonally and water drains from one corner. I use a final rinse
of about 3 minutes with a propriatory wetting agent solution to avoid drying
marks.
The pegs have two cutouts to form the grip at the end and also allow them to
go over a washing/drying line, set up above my wetbench. This works well as
I'm never in a hurry being an amateur.

I dry 10 x 8 fibre based prints in a similar manner.  The curl is generally
minimal (Krntmere Fineprint VC paper) and easily corrected by a heavy book
placed on a pile of prints.

JR

Good carriers use anti-Newton glass for the top glass, or multicoated
glass
which removes the reflection / pattern causing the rings. Dust should not
be
a problem in a darkroom with filtered air blown in under positive
pressure.
I use glass carriers, and rarely need to spot prints unless the negative
is
damaged.

The depth of focus applies to the image plane, or in the case of an
enlarger,
the focus error permitted at the easel, not the carrier. 

The two-way error at the easel is 2 * f/stop * coc where the coc is the 
acceptable circle of confusion of the print (0.25 mm, or 0.125 mm
for critical work).

At the carrier, one is concerned with the depth of field since one is
taking
a macro photo of the negative or chrome when making a print. The two way
depth of field at the carrier is  2 * f/stop * coc * (M+1) / M^2, where M
is the 
print magnification. For a critical  5X print using f/11 which gives
optimal corner
sharpness with most APO lenses, the depth of field is 2 * 11 * .125 *
(5+1)/25 =
0.66 mm. Since film only sags in one direction, one should use the
one-way
depth of field of 0.33 mm. A deviation of 0.33 mm may not be noticed by
eye, 
but can be seen in the print as a loss of corner acutance.

John brought up backpacking with the view camera in his post about
darkcloths and focussing.  This brings up something that I have been
wondering:  what kind of backpack do you use?  I went to a web site about
this issue, and some people thought that the backpacks made specially for
camera equipment were best, and others thought that regular backpacking
backpacks were better, but then you had to find smaller containers to pack
cameras and lenses in. I wonder what people on this list who backpack their
cameras to remote places use?  Favorite brand of backpack, etc?  How do you
pack the tripod?

 Backpack - f.64 BPX  will hold 4x5 to 8x10 field camera + all of the
goodies you want to carry.  Depends on how far you are going.  Has good
suspension and fits most people.  Try on first!!!! Could not get it to fit
on my wife - too short.  Their BP (smaller) did fit her.

For real heavy duty, I think that Tenba makes a bag that is designed to go
on a pack frame.  Sorry, too old for that.

Tripod - GB&W (grab baggage & walk) or strap onto pack somehow.
Best Regards,
     Howard F. Efner

Well Shannon;
         To sum it up quickly.  The backpacks made by the Camera case makers
are better made for camera equipment,  they are well padded and
compartmentalized for carrying camera stuff.  But they generally are not made
for long trips and carrying a lot of weight.  So if you are only going on day
trips,  then you can probably do well with a camera bag back pack.  If you go
out for multi day trips and need to carry tent, provisions, clothes than you
probably would be happiest with a real back pack that you can modify to carry
your camera gear.

I have been using the Super Trekker coming from Lowepro for more than
three years now. The total weight with my Wista 45-SP and all the
accessories I need is some 15 kg (35 lbs) excluding the tripod, which
I'm carrying in a separate tripod-bag. It is very good to carry also in
rather demanding terrain. It was a big relief to me when I found it.

Just a thought - occasionally I have had dust drop onto the inner surface of
the diffuser in the enlarger's light box, or settle on the lower surface of
a condenser. This gives white spots with slightly blurred edges in the
prints. From your comments though, it seems as though your white spots are
completely random and are sharp edged.

Chaps and Chapesses

We seem to be plagued with a small number of occasional random small
white soft edged round blemishes on our prints.  We believe them to be
originating from the negative (note the soft edges) and would welcome
any advice on what these might be due to and how to avoid them in
future.  They do not appear on every frame but always of course on the
best ones and in the most critical spots.

These white blemishes seem to be independent of film type and developer
combinations used.  We develop, stop, fix and then wash as usual in a
Patterson spiral tank inverting and tapping the tank to dislodge air
bubbles.  The water used has been through a water softener and a reverse
osmosis filter system.

Any advice on the likely cause would be very much appreciated.  Spotting
is not our strong point.

Regards
Malcolm

Glass surely will always give problems of cleanliness and Newton rings.

More to the point is that the depth of FOCUS for any lens is easy to
calculate as it is independant on focal length.
At f16 its 0,7mm, f22 it's 1,3mm, f32 it's 2,7mm, f45 it's 5,4mm and f64
it's 11mm.
So,say, with the enlarger lens on f22 the negative will have to have a bow
of more than 1,3mm to give focus problems. This amount of bow would be
clearly visible and would indicate an unusual problem certainly for 5 x 4
negatives which I generally use.

As a matter of interest these same values can be used when focussing on near
and far points of interest with the camera to determine f stop to give
sharpness over areas of interest.


Hi John
I am well aware of the prices of LPL7451 neg carriers being a user myself. I
have also been defeated in my attempts to make a 'top glass only' negative
carrier for this machine for smaller formats since the base metal plate of
the glassless carrier has pins projecting upwards to position the negative
strip. I thought there would be no problem in getting a top glass (anti
Newton's rings) drilled to fit these pins. Not so. Two sheets of glass (very
expensive as you say) were shattered trying to do this before I gave up. I
now simply lay a piece of A.N.R. glass between the pins. I works, but I
don't like the bodge up.
As to depth of focus - sorry, this is at the easel, not the neg. carrier.
That at the neg carrier is depth of field. Firstly, the apertures you
mention will give poor enlarging lens performance assuming that the basic
aperure is f5.6. For smaller formats, it is likely to be f4 or f2.8, which
will only magnify the performance drop.
In any case, who says that the variation in negative flatness cannot be more
than the tolerances you quote at f16, even if they are actually depth of
focus figures, even WITHOUT negative popping under heat? Just hold your
negative carrier and clamp your negative in the carrier under hand pressure.
Now hold the carrier at an angle to a fluorescent light tube so that the
negative surface reflects it. I have yet to find a carrier that will hold
the negative so that the tube is reflected as straight. In most cases it is
alarmingly wavey. Try it again with glass as a comparison. This is the
difference in negative flatness.
And another point John. Who says that the depth of focus or field will give
sharp results? These figures are quoted as giving 'acceptable' sharpness.
Acceptable to whom? I guess most people who rely on camera depth of field
scales sonn realise that they may yield 'acceptable' sharpenss in to an
average family photographer in small prints, but the minute we start looking
for true quality in larger prints, they are simply misleading. If you use a
glassless carrier, there is little point in using a top quality enalrging
lens. You are simply throwing away most of its performance in these
so-called 'acceptable' tolerances.
Sharpenss in a print is the result of a whole series of small steps. This is
just one of them. However, I feel the combined effects of each of these
small steps are multiplied, not added together. It is also a sign of a
mind-set to the image that seems to square with the approach of large format
photographers - 'good enough' just isn't good enough. They are striving for
ultimate photographic quality.
You raise the old red herring of dust on the carrier glasses. Dust rarely
settles tenaciously to carrier glasses. It's the work of a moment to wipe it
away ( I clean my glasses at the start of each printing day with a
microporous cloth, then simply wipe the back of my hand over the glass as I
insert each negative). HOWEVER, dust is magnetically attracted to film, and
is difficult to remove. This applies with glass or glassles carriers.  An
uncovered negative in a glassless carrier can attract dust DURING a printing
session - and I use a number of anti-static devices. Glass covered film
doesn't have this problem.
Finally, in the original reply, I mentioned the Meopta Magnifax enlarger.
The carriers for this, glass or glassless with the happy ability to
intermix, are of very substantial metal construction, yet are very
economically priced. For anybody working up to 6x9, it's a hard machine to
beat for value and practicality. It just looks ugly. But then I'm no oil
painting myself.

I just bought a Tamrac Extreme 777 back pack, and used it for a West Wales
coastal walking holiday for my Rollei SL66 four lens and three backs outfit.
It is very well made and designed for camera/lens storage, but I am
disappointed and will be selling it. Reasons? The main one is that it is
just too heavy - inevitable with its quality construction. It seems to weigh
at least half as much again as the camera equipment itself, and this is just
the middle of the size range! The 787 is much bigger. I also found it
uncomfortable. There are a myriad of adjustments. It seems ludicrous that I
can't get a comfortable fit - but I can't. I am very short (I hurt myself
stepping off kerbs!), so that's probably the reason.
Another annoyance emerged in practical use. Because it is front loading, it
is necessary to lay it down on its back to extract kit. Unless the ground is
clean and dry (what a joke!), this means transferring dirt and dampness to
clothing next time you put the back pack on.
The pack is designed to strap on a tripod vertically down its centre. It
might do this with small tripods OK, but even with my light weight second
string tripod, the Manfrotto carbon fibre model, it stands up so far above
one's head that walking under any trees, bushes, rock ledges etc. is a real
problem.
So I have reverted to my old method, which I find much lighter and more
comfortable. I bought an old, cheap, external frame back pack and threw the
nasty back pack away but saved the aluminium tubular frame with shoulder
straps. To this it was very easy to attach straps with clip lock plastic
buckles as used on back packs and camera bags. I bought a good quality 'top
loading' camera bag big enough for my kit - it actually holds more than the
physically much bigger Tamrac 777. I hook this onto the frame using the
click lock buckled straps to attach to the bags main D rings to which the
conventional shoulder strap is left attached also. There are small D rings
at the base of the back of the bag intended for attaching a waist strap. I
attach these to the vertical side tubes of the aluminium frame by simple
metal key rings which can slide easily up and down the tube, but stop the
bag from swinging off sideways.
In use the bag is held fairly high up on the frame and my back, which I find
comfortable. The bottom of the frame curves outwards (it originally
supported the base of the back pack). When I take it off, the unit stands
vertically on this, and I can extract camera equipment very easily without
laying the back pack down in the mud.
If I do want to lay the unit down for any reason like this, the key ring
retainers allow the bag to slide upwards on the frame tubes so that the
frame lies horizontally while the bag remains vertical.
Another pair of the clip buckled straps easily holds my main Manfrotto
tripod across this base area of the tubular frame, but in fact I usually
carry the tripod via its own strap over my ahead horizontally across my
chest. The front weight counter-balances the back pack weight this way, and
the tripod is quickly into action if I need it with the back pack still on
my back.
A couple of refinements were a strap joining the shoulder straps across my
chest to stop the shoulder straps slipping off, and a waist strap to pull
the weight of the pack onto my hips as well as being born on my shoulders.
It works well. I should have patented the design!
Anyone want to buy a Tamrac Extreme 777 t a bargain price?

There is an extensive discussion of various people's experiences with all
sorts of back packs and large format cameras at Tuan's large format home
page. FWIW, the discussion there persuaded me that dedicated camera back
packs were too expensive, too heavy, and too uncomfortable for hiking more
than a mile or so and that a camping type pack  was a better way to go for
the way I photograph. The Kelty Redwing seems to be particularly popular, in
part because it is a front loading pack. Many of the camping backpacks are
top loading, which isn't real good for camera gear. The Kelty costs around
$100 as I recall. I don't have the URL for Tuan's home page handy but if you
do a search in Yahoo or elsewhere for "Tuan" it will pop up quickly. Perhaps
someone who does have it might post it here.

I'm a life-long hiker and photographer, accustomed to multi-day backpack
trips.  On such occasions, I find that all I can handle is to carry a good
35mm kit or perhaps my Rollei TLR (and I'm a big fit guy).  I use an f64
backpack with my Wisner 8x10 TF.  

The camera, lenses and holders (andbackpack) weigh upwards of 30
pounds.  I really can't imagine carrying a whole lot more - like tent,
sleeping bag, food and cooking gear.  I think I'd be real tempted to limit
myself to a Crown Graphic on long excursions where LF was my goal...or
else, as the others have said, keep the trips short and eliminate the
overnight backpack gear.

I read this discussion too.  I am leaning toward a regular camping backpack
also, but shouldn't you put your camera and lenses inside some sort of
cushioned bags inside the backpack, since all those little dividers aren't
there?  What kind of thing would be best to put a four by five view camera
in, for example?  I would think the lenses would be fine in those foam lens
holders you can buy.  Somebody on that page (mentioned above) got insulated
coolers, like lunch boxes or bags, for his stuff. I wonder where you buy
those?

I am a novice with the view camera so pardon me for asking a probably
elementary question:  is there any way to see through the camera when you
have it stopped down to f64?  Or should you just open it up in order to
focus, then stop back down to shoot?

Right, I agree.  For trips of more than a day, I can't imagine carrying a
large format camera and all its accessories, unless somebody going with you
is willing to carry most of the other gear.  I need something to carry the
view camera in for one day excursions around my hilly country neighborhood
in Tennessee.

Shannon,

I too was in the same boat a while back. For the last couple of years I used
a backpack for my equipment but it didn't have any real padding and it was
a bit of a pain to get items down at the bottom.  It did hold everything
I needed.  I figured it was time to look for alternatives.  Looked at the 
pro specialty packs but found them way too expensive for my tastes (I'm cheap
at heart :).  Then my better half noted we had a spare luggage case that we
never use much anymore.  It was actually a pack we had bought from Mountain
Equipment CO-OP years ago.  It's actually a small suitcase backpack with
shoulder straps that hides in a compartment.  Also has a normal handle for 
carrying by hand.  Nice part was it zippered opened on three sides and was 
water proof (though I have yet to test it thoroughly).  Nice big space
(13x18x7), enough for me (camera, three lenses, 10 holders, meter) on the
inside with another pocket on the flap on the outside.  My wife volunteered
her sewing skills to created a bumper pad made of denim and high density
camping foam for around the perimeter, along with a few dividers.  Everything 
was fitted with velcro strips.

Had my doubts about it but after I packed it and adjusted the straps, it was
great!  Small enough to move about with it in the bush and the 30 lbs rested
where it was comfortable for long hikes.  Maybe it could use a waist belt
but for now it works well.  Price originally for the bag was about $40 CDN.
Hope this helps.

I'm interested in subscribing, but the sample issue I received was badly
mutiliated, and I wouldn't want to pay for more of the same.  Are you
planning to use some sort of envelope or plastic bag to protect future

You certainly can wrap the camera, lenses, etc. in towels, socks, or in the
wraps that Calumet and probably others sell. I keep the camera in a Calumet
wrap and the lenses in compartments pirated from a camera bag. However, I've
seen some nice compartmentalized packs, where the compartments were made of
foam rubber (the kind sold at camping stores for use with sleeping bags)
reinforced with cardboard cut out to go around the sides and then a fabric
sewn around the cardboard. The compartment s are then attached to the
backpack with hot glue. Sorry that this isn't a better description but
hopefully your get the idea.

Sorry I took so long to reply but I was trying out a few new tricks for
shadow detail and just got back.
 You will need the SE4500 \Pin printer and  the optional format masking
plates for each format you want to work with.  It comes with the VR
Multiformat Punch. and a standard 4x5 format plate.
  What you do is..... in the light you punch your original neg or slide
with the VF multiformat punch and place it over the pins on the Pin printer.
Then in the dark you punch and place the masking film over the pins on top
of your original neg or transparency. The top lid is then closed and the
whole pin printer turned over. This leaves a white diffusion plate up
towards the light and the neg/transparency next with the masking film on
bottom with the final layer the black lid of the pin printer. You then make
your exposure..... flip the pin printer over remove the masking film and
develop. You can then use several options for placing the developed and dry
mask in register. Standard pin mounts cheaply available from Wess can be
used for smaller formats or you can use the pin punch or pin printer to
align the mask and original film and either tape together, or use something
like the Beseler pin neg carrier { designed for Wess }, or make your own
holder by mounting pins in any carrier you want.
  It works very well and the pin slide mounts { 35mm - 120 mm } are cheap
enough that I return peoples slides or negs in them with or with out the
mask attached as per their wishes. I have found that I can make the masks
and original images print very well  by using the pin slide mounts without
the glass which saves dust problems!
 Be glad to help more if you need it!
Good luck
Chuck

Hi,

An interesting thread, as I never have thought of NOT carrying my LF gear. I
just came back from a 2 week expedition to New England, USA, and packed my
gear with me wherever I went to shoot. This consists of about 45 lbs of
gear - Wisner 4x5 Traditional, 5 lenses, a 35mm with 3 lenses, a Fuji 6x9
rangefinder, a Manfrotto tripod and ballhead, and 25 film holders. A lot to
carry, but none of it I would be willing to leave behind. My film and
changing tent always stayed behind wherever I was staying.

I carry the gear between a Lowepro backpack, and a belt-pack system (the
Fuji 6x9 and 2 35mm lenses go on the belt, which also hold 4 film holders in
a pouch when I am shooting, not carrying). I should also mention I usually
carry 1.5 L of water, and food with me, so it adds up to more than 50 lbs by
the time I head out.

SO now I am in the darkroom, processing 300 sheets of film...20 at a
time...slow slow slow. But you've got to love those negs :-)

e.

I use the Lowepro Phototrekker AW. The AW just means it has a hidden =
plastic cover which can be pulled over it in really bad weather.
With a stripped down MPP (2.4kgs), a 210 and 110mm lenses, 8 DDS's, an =
all metal Graflex back,spotmeter,compendium lensshade,cold and wet =
weather clothes and various odds and ends it weighs about 18 lbs. The =
Manfrotto 190 short tripod can be strapped beneath and across the =
backpack but can be awkward when walking through narrow gaps so where =
possible I tend to carry it in my hands.
My backpacking never consists of more than say 2 hours out and 2 hours =
back from the car as this is about my physical limit at my age (58) =
without overdoing it so not really a 'geniune' backpacker.
For the family holiday envirment I use a cheap,well made pack with a cut =
down set of items-say one lens,no compendium lensshade but a rubber one =
etc. My wife often volunteers to carry the tripod.
Regards

Barry

Thank you such a protracted reply on the above. It has given me =
something to think about as I must say that to date my 20 x 16 =
enlargements from 5 x 4 negatives ( souped in either HC110 (1:39)  or =
DiXactol (one shot)) seem sharp to me from edge to edge. Maybe I could =
send you one for comment if you would not mind-together with the =
negative if so required.
My enlarging lens for 5 x 4 work is a 150mm Rodagon.
I must admit that as large format camera lenses give their best =
performance at around f22 I assumed that the enlarging lenses used for =
large format negatives did likewise. Although on reflection there is no =
real reason why they should.
>From your response I take it that you have modified the LPL glass =
carrier to take ANR glass. Is this the case and is it really necessary =
considering the recent mail on ANR products available from the likes of =
Silverprint?
I tried the fluorescent tube test along the film in the glassless =
carrier and was surprised by the distortion seen. I should have checked =
like this before as I was taught to evaluate metal in like fashion a =
million years ago during my engineering apprenticeship.

Thanks you for all the help.
All I now need is a second mortgage to aquire the glass carrier for my 5 =
x 4 negs.

Regards

JR

Barry

Thanks very much for your thought.  I am somewhat embarrassed to say
that there are some 'foreign bodies' somewhere in the optical system. 
Although one would not normally notice the blemishes when printing
because they are so few and small, it is just about possible to make
them out on the print frame if you know where to look.  I just moved the
negative and hey presto, the spots on the print frame stayed still.  I
suppose that they only showed on some prints according to the subject
matter in the exact blemish spot(s).

This is on a V35 enlarger and we dust every negative and the carrier
with an antistatic brush before printing, so given that they do in fact
give soft, not a hard, edged blemishes on the print, I suspect that you
are right on the money.

BTW, we agree with your statement that Delta 100 in DiXactol is
particularly effective for 35mm and are likely converts from PAN F in
DiXactol.  We still have to free up the refrigerator butter compartment
with all that hoarded APX-25 though.  If I recall correctly, I believe
that you previously intimated that APX did not tan particularly well in
DiXactol but wonder if you have any suggestions for developing APX-25 in
DiXactol anyway or do we treat it the same as say PAN F ?  Any advice
would be very much appreciated.  Your suggested times for other film
types seem perfect for our setup.

Regards
Malcolm (and Sylvia)

I use the film holders of a Combi-Plan developer tank, and a wooden
cloth peg to hang the film-holder in my drying cabinet..;-)..
This holders can hold 6 sheets, drying takes a bit longer, but there is
no damage on the negative..

Best,

Hi to one and all. I am a newcomer to the list and a step or two up the =
B/W ladder from novice. Just started in M/F recently with a Yashica Mat =
124G. the use of which is, well er interesting.  Almost two years ago =
now I bought on the spur of the moment as you do, a Durst M670 colour =
enlarger without lens, but various neg masks including an Anti-Newton =
glass for 6x9 also a light-box for same. for which I am now gratefull =
re- the 6x6 Yashica. The thing that I find irritating is the very abrupt =
focussing action on the Durst. Using an EL Nikkor f2.8N lens which was =
really easy to focus on the 'plastic' Paterson enlarger I had =
previously, which had a screw action lens panel. I use a Paterson Micro =
grain magnifier and look for an all black grain image, either side of =
which is a red or a blue edged image. Durst people advised a Neriotub =
lens panel to get the Nikkor rear element closer to the negative. After =
spending a few bob and a week or three wait. I tried it. No difference =
whatsoever!  The Nikkor sinks into the Neriotub thus making it a fiddle =
to adjust the aperture which of course you now cannot see. Tough eh!  =
Sickened by the glowing reports from Barry Thornton about the Meopta =
enlargers, which was my plan A two years ago.

I hang my negs on plastic clothes-pegs - I have used wooden ones, but find
they mar the corners the film hangs from. In the past I have used Kodak film
clips, which are great, but they are also expensive, so $1.00 of clothes
pegs do me fine :-)

  I can't find a listing for the Telomar, it sounds like a telephoto lens.
The Heliar is a modification of the Cooke Triplet with compounded elements
at both ends. Coverage is given as 60deg. 
  The Euryplan is a Plasmat type lens. Probable coverage angle is about
75deg or 80deg. 
  These all sound like 4x5 lenses. The Euryplan, if it is a Plasmat type,
should have an image circle at infinity of around 250mm or a bit larger.
5x7 requires 210mm. The others won't cover it. None of them will make it to
8x10. 
 Both Voigtlnder and Meyer made quality lenses but I have no idea of the
performance of these specific lenses. Some very fine lenses have been
designed using the Heliar generic type but my suspicion is that, for the
most part, Heliars are no better than Tessars of the same speed.

Shannon,
I don,t know if anyone else mention this technique, but I use a hiking
type pack pack that I have used 4 inch foam to adapt it to a camera
pack.  I cut the foam in the design of the pack and then I make cutouts
in the shape of my camera (mamiya 645) and the lens. The foam protects
and organizes at the same time. The outside pockets carry film and other
accessories.

Have a good day,
Jerry Brown

Gentleman (and ladies):

Found a man who is selling the following lenses

Voigtlander 180/5.5 Telomar
Voigtlander Heliar, 150/4.5 pre war uncoated
Meyer Gorlitz Euryplan 165/ 5.4
No price given at this moment

Does any of these covers 5x7 or even 8x10 ?
And how is their performance ?

Thanks,

C.J. Cheng

I don't shoot 4x5, yet, but don't see why this couldn't work.  I use a
clothes hanger, the ones with the pant clips/pins.  I hang the film from
there and add a wooden clothes pin at the corner for weight and to absorb
any water.

         I found some references to the lenses you were asking about.
         Some of the coverage claimed by earlier texts may be exaggerated, 
so you will have to test to see what coverage they really do give. The 
Telomar seems to have been intended for 2 1/4 x 3 1/4 and the Heliar might 
need to be stopped down to fully cover 4x5. The Meyer Euryplan should cover 
4x5 with movements, and possibly cover 5x7. You will have to test them to 
see for yourself.
         Are they good lenses? Try them and see if you like the images. 
Only you can answer that question.


Voigtlander 180/5.5 Telomar

Listed under Telephoto lenses for 35mm and larger cameras.*
5 elements, 4 groups*
Focal lengths: 180 -360mm*
180 mm coverage 2 1/4 x 3 1/4"   33 degrees, 5 elements, 3 groups ****


Voigtlander Heliar 150/4.5

5 elements, 3 groups 60 degrees ***
5 7/8" (149.225mm) coverage 3 1/4 x 4 1/4" 52 degrees, 5 elements, 3 
groups. ****


Meyer Gorlitz Euryplan 165/5.4

listed as f4.5
6 elements, 4 groups (Plasmat type) *
"Meyer also made a similar lens [to the Plasmat] called the Euryplan, so 
they must have acquired this name from Schulz and Billerbeck." **

"Shulze Portrait Euryplan (f4.5) is really of the Planar type." ***

Hi guys

Ive just souped a roll of PAN F 120 in Rodinal 1:100, the developer
came out bright pink/red!!  Fixed it for 2 minutes and washed for
about 10 but theres still seems to be a very thin base fog with a
pinkish tint.  Whats the red stuff and should I have a clear base?  I
think I prefer APX 25 anyway and will stick to that in future.

Jason

that you previously intimated that APX did not tan particularly well in
DiXactol but wonder if you have any suggestions for developing APX-25 in
DiXactol anyway or do we treat it the same as say PAN F ?  Any advice

Agfa APX25 is fine in DiXactol, and it tans well. However, the stain is not
very pronounced. I would treat it as Pan F.

My LPL glass carrier has ANR glass on the top as standard. What I was trying
to do was to modify the glassless carriers for smaller formats to take a
single glass top plate. From memory - this was 7 or 8 years ago I guess - I
simply bought a replacement ANR glass from the LPL importer via Leeds
Photovisual, my local supplier, and attempted to have that drilled to fit
over the negative location pins that come mounted on the base plate of the
smaller format glassless carriers. I failed! After the same procedure failed
a second time with a second replacement glass, I gave up. The glass
specialist told me that the ANR glass was too thin to drill safely even with
great care.
If you are satisfied with the sharpness of your pictures John, THAT is what
counts - not my opinion. I know you are a careful worker, and don't think
you would tolerate unacceptable standards.

I was thinking this could work, actually:  retrofitting a regular back with
foam containers or bumpers as you  put it and dividers.  Glad to know it
works!

I've used this combination and got the same thing as far as reddish
developer is concerned. I've also gotten the reddish developer with other
films when using Rodinal at various dilutions so I think it's a
characteristic of Rodinal and nothing to be concerned about. The pinkish
film is a different matter. Pan F shouldn't be pink after it has been fixed.
Pink, with any film other than T Max (which is always pink), usually
indicates inadequate fixing (too short a time or too weak a fixer). The good
news is that you should be able to get rid of it even now. Try mixing fresh
fix and fix for a longer time - 3 to 5 minutes is the usual time for film.

Chuck

I will try to explain what is in fact a simple quick method of checking =
the shape of any bright surface.
As a fluorescent tube is generally quite long it produces a bright line =
reflection on any shiny surface.
If that surface is flat the line will be dead straigth but if the =
surface has distortion the reflection will change shape from the =
straight line as it moves over the surface.
The trick is to hold the surface, in this case a film negative, in such =
a position as to get the reflection to say lie at right angles to the =
film edge. Then gently angle the film to allow the reflection to move =
over its surface. As it does so it will change shape depending on the =
surface topology (shape).
It is possible then to see if the surface is convex,concave or =
pincushioned etc.

Hope this helps.

Regards

JR

Hi Geoff

I have the M670 with the condenser head, the focusing is quite coarse
and inclined to slip which drives me absolutely nuts!!  If I'm doing a
fairly big enlargement, I'm at full stretch between the grain focuser
and the knob on the head chasing the focus for what seems like ages!
Also the Durst spares are an extortionate price, for what are often
bits of plastic.  Actually I'm about to do some printing in a minute,
I think Ill strip and clean the friction mechanism on the focusing,
see if it helps any.  I wish they'd used a rack and pinion.  I could
probably do with the recessed lensboard too.

If anyone has Leitz IIC taking up space ;-)

Jason

Hi to one and all. I am a newcomer to the list and a step or two up
the B/W ladder from novice. Just started in M/F recently with a
Yashica Mat 124G. the use of which is, well er interesting.  Almost
two years ago now I bought on the spur of the moment as you do, a
Durst M670 colour enlarger without lens, but various neg masks
including an Anti-Newton glass for 6x9 also a light-box for same. for
which I am now gratefull re- the 6x6 Yashica. The thing that I find
irritating is the very abrupt focussing action on the Durst. Using an
EL Nikkor f2.8N lens which was really easy to focus on the 'plastic'
Paterson enlarger I had previously, which had a screw action lens
panel. I use a Paterson Micro grain magnifier and look for an all
black grain image, either side of which is a red or a blue edged
image. Durst people advised a Neriotub lens panel to get the Nikkor
rear element closer to the negative. After spending a few bob and a
week or three wait. I tried it. No difference whatsoever!  The Nikkor
sinks into the Neriotub thus making it a fiddle to adjust the aperture
which of course you now cannot see. Tough eh!  Sickened by the glowing
reports from Barry Thornton about the Meopta enlargers, which was my
plan A two years ago.

All -

'Just a note to let you know about some changes I plan to institute to this
list.  I am currently researching how to actually accomplish some of this,
but assuming I find what I need, pure-silver will be changing as follows:

1) All HTML formatted email submissions will be rejected.  Only ASCII email
   will be allowed on the list.
2) Mail with binary attachments will be rejected.

You will still be able to note URLs in your email as pointers to the Web.

The reason for this is that as HTML gets more powerful and moves towards XML,
things are actually getting *less* standardized and security problems are
bound to start popping up.  By insisting that everyone limit themselves to
ASCII, we are more-or-less guaranteed the ability to safely read each others'
submissions.

For most of you, this is a non-issue.  However, a few of you will have to
change your email program settings to send text not formatted HTML.  MS
Outlook, especially, seems to like doing this by default and also has other
strange behavior that drives people like me (admins) nuts.

If anyone has real heartburn about this, speak now and let us know why it
is urgent that HTML be supported.  Otherwise, assuming I can find the 
right sendmail hacks, I will institute this pretty soon.

Also, I had previously indicated my intention to make this a closed list.
In actual fact, we've had very few spam attacks, so I am deferring this
action until it is really needed because I really want to avoid the
admin headaches that closing the list entails.

I'm surprised to hear that people actually USE those antistatic brushes 
(always seemed to themselves be dust magnets).  I learned to print in 
earnest at a small pro lab, where we first wiped the neg (gently) with an 
Ilford Antistaticum cloth, then blew off both sides w/compressed air.  I 
occasionally give a shot of air to the area around the neg carrier to 
dislodge any recalcitrant dust motes hanging around.

Anyone else's method??

Tim, perhaps you could clarify this for me.  I use MSN hotmail (MS Internet 
Explorer Browser).  I normally send using default settings, but have the 
option to check off "Rich Text Format," which permits color/
font size enhancements, etc.

I think using my default settings constitute ASCII formatting, but wanted to 
make sure this is correct.

Thanks.

Adrienne

Hello Jason !
If it is a friction mechanism, have you tried to tigten the holding
screws ? I'll do that to have the focusion mechanism stay in place on my
trusty Meopta Opemus, so maybe it will work on the Durst also !
Hope this helps

  Sounds fine to me. 
  I occasionally read mail using a Telnet program when I am away from home.
This has no means for decoding HTML, it just shows everything there,
including all the formatting tags.
  Those who never see the raw messages this way would be surprized at just
how much extra stuff is sent. HTML or Winmail more than doubles the length
of messages. Someimes it tripples them. 
  So, I think this is a good move.

Tim,

How do you change it to plain e-mail?  Sorry, better with the camera than I
am with the

Tim,

    Thank you for taking care of all this stuff. Just one question: I have a
Mac and use Outlook express. I set preference on plain text (not HTLM) and I
would like to know if it is OK for you? Once again many thanks.

    Daniel

Adrienne, I've been using a Kinetronics Staticwisk for almost 10 years, I 
wouldn't be without it!  I have a sort of dustdance to exorcise the dreaded 
demon (I hate spotting) which consists of using a Zerostat (bought 30 years 
ago for my vinyl record collection) ionising gun, followed by the brush and 
then possibly some compressed air.  I also brush the surface of the neg 
carrier.  Thankfully these antics mean that I have little or no spotting to 
do!

Cheers

Marten

  Nearly all roll films for the last seventy or so years have had
anti-halation backings. Usually the dye is such that it decolorizes in
either developer or fixer. 
  When I use Rodinal it comes out in quite poisonous looking colors. The
color seems to depend on the film. I don't know for sure what it is but
suspect developing reaction products rather than dyes from either
anti-halation backing or sensitizing.
  Most other film developers are not colored, or become straw colored in
use. The straw color is typical of oxidized developing agents. I might try
Mike Gudzinowicz to see if he knows what is actually going on here. My
suspicion is that it may have somthing to do with the very high pH of
Rodinal. The developing agent in Rodinal, p-aminophenol hydrochloride
sodium salt, is closly related to Metol/Elon, which is monomethyl
para-aminophenol sulfate, and has in many ways similar characteristics.
The coarse-grain characteristic of Rodinal having more to do with the
hydroxide activator than the reducing agent.

Hi Georges

Unfortunately theres no facility for adjusting the friction on the
M670, just two captive leaf springs mounted in plastic.

Thanks for the suggestion

Hello Jason !
If it is a friction mechanism, have you tried to tigten the holding
screws ? I'll do that to have the focusion mechanism stay in place on
my
trusty Meopta Opemus, so maybe it will work on the Durst also !
Hope this helps

I got tired of throwing away empty cans of air--it seemed unecological--and
bought a brush, which works fine. But mine is fairly new.

For Outlook users and folks with similar programs:
I'm a computer novice and there may be much simpler ways, but one way I have
found to check on the type of mail you are sending is to send yourself an
email { I use this same feature to check unkown emailers that I think may be
"Art Patrons" so that I just don't delete them......the spammers will have a
line in the address that says "undisclosed recipients" usually.
  After recieving your email back .......You then highlight it by right
clicking and a window pops up. You click "Details" and a complete list of
the route, type of text, and email program of the sender of the note was
written in pops up. I did this for the email I just recieved from the
puresilver list that Richard wrote, I copied it and pasted it here.....it is
as follows {note the fourth from bottom line with text type}:

Sorry if I caused you grief! Just to rub salt in the wound, the latest
Magnifax has both a coarse and fine focus control. Actually, you should not
be struggling as you are with the Durst. Usually, friction drives on
focusing mechanisms have a small screw on the leaf spring which is normally
used to press the actuating wheel against the bellows drive rod. A small
turn will make focus looser and smoother or, or tighten up a slack action
and focus slippage if adjusted in the opposite direction.
Another tip I discovered accidentally when cleaning in the darkroom is that
silicone spray polish, like Mr. Sheen here in the UK, if sprayed on to the
bellows drive rods and polished off really eases the focusing action. It
acts as a lubricant without leaving an oily residue. It's also anti-static
in action. The same treatment on enlarger columns smooths out raising and
lowering the head too. Obviously, you need to take great care not to get any
of the spray on lens surfaces - I usually remove the lens from the enlarger
first to make doubly sure.
Worth a try anyway.

Ilford have always, at least in living memory, had an anti halation backing.
Pan F also has a front gelatine anti-curl layer that DiXactol reveals by
tanning its surface. Some Ilford films do have a faint magenta-ish film base
colour, and some slightly blue, that will not be removed by any amount of
fixing. They are just made that way - I think it helps prevent light piping.
It has no effect on printing.

<SNIP>  
Greetings Tim.  According to Herr. Hutchings, he gives the following in Book
of Pyro.  Should be starting points for individual calibration.

APX 400 EI=200 N=16min/70F
Delta 100 EI=80 N=11, +1=15, +2=20, -1=9(+1/2exp), -2=7(+11/2exp)
Delta 400 EI=260-320 N=12, +1=16, +2=21, -1=10(+1/2), -2=8(+11/2)
Best Regards,
     Howard F. Efner

I've come across several references to 'stand' developers.  Does anyone have a
quick explanation of what this is, and what any benefits might be?

Stand developer is just what is says:  A developer formula that you can
emerse the film into, agitate for 15- 30 seconds and let it stand.

Then, take it out, wash or wash and stop, then fix and it's done.

I have just heard from my wholesaler, here in the UK, that Agfa are to cease 
production of APX25 in 35mm and 120 formats!

Since AGFA's ideas on marketing their B&W products could be written on the 
back of a shrivelled postage stamp (I haven't received a mailing or seen an 
ad in ages) I suppose it is not surprising but it is such sad news as this is 
such fine film.

I currently use around 2,000 rolls p.a of the 120, dev'd in Rodinal at 1-50 
as the preferred film for my portraiture business.  

Any suggestions for Film/Dev combo's with the same midtones and lack of grain 
(and character!) grateful received.

Does anyone know of a freezer going cheap?

I am going to go and have a good long sulk!

Marten

My mistake. A reminder not to judge everything by eye...

I've actually never been a big fan of Ilford films. I like the forgiving 
tonal range of some of their films, but haven't been thrilled with the 
'look' of the final print.

I just toned some prints in selenium for the first time. I used a 20:1
dilution.  The prints got contrastier and darker than I wanted after they
dried.  I guess part of the trick to toning is learning to make a softer,
lighter print so that when you tone it, it will have the degree of darkness
and contrast that you desire.  Seems like this might be a little tricky to
learn, though. Wonder if anybody has any suggestions about figuring this
out, and also I'd like to know what dilution of selenium toner you use.

I have just talked to Agfa HQ in Cologne and they know nothing about
ceasing production and sales of APX 25. As they say in Germany, people
whose death is rumoured usually live very long.

An alternative would be Delta 100 in Xtol 1+1 or, if you want more
acutance, in 1+3. Make sure you use enough stock solution per film if you
use higher dilutions.

Greetings-

"BEYOND BLACK AND WHITE" -

A workshop for artists who wish to explore the possibilities that exist for
further development of a black and white image.

Where & When:

October 11-15, 2000 at Colorado Mountain College/ Breckenridge. The class
will run from 9AM-2PM daily, allowing participants plenty of time to explore
(and to photograph) this exquisitely beautiful country (Breckenridge is
10,000 ft high in the Rockies, very near the continental divide).

During the course of this we will cover a variety of specialty toning
processes for gelatin-silver papers with special emphasis on split-toning
techniques.  A significant portion of the class will also be spent exploring
the mordancage process.  The use of low-tech, plastic "Diana" cameras will
be encouraged during the class.

This workshop might be thought of as "alt-processes" for commercially
available papers and is recommended for persons wishing to take their
photography out of the realm of "document" and into the realm of "image."

The class will cover, among numerous other processes, the GP-1 gold
split-toning process I use for much of my own work.  ("Split-toning"
achieves an exotic range of colors and hues through the chemical action of
the toner or toners).

MORDANCAGE is a variation on the ancient "etch/bleach" process and is the
name given to this particular variation by Jean-Pierre Sudre in France.  It
is a process which, to put it in the simplest of terms, reduces an image to
its graphic elements - often with exotic toned effects as well.  Best known
practitioners of this process (all students of Sudre's) include Pierre-Louis
Martin in France and both Elizabeth Opalenick and Craig Stevens here in the
US.

For more information about this class you may contact me
mailto:quryhous@midcoast.com.  For class registration and Breckenridge
accommodation information contact Tom Hart at: mailto:thart@coloradomtn.edu

Thanks-

Shannon, I'm wondering what paper/chemistry combo you used.  Also, did you 
dilute the toner w/a working solution of wash aid?

I ask only because I use the same dilution you mentioned, and have noticed 
no appreciable difference from non-toned prints.  The main difference I 
encounter is dry-down, which I estimate accounts for somewhere between 5-10% 
darker than just-made prints.

thats too bad...great products always get dumped...just look at 
Ektaure as a prime example.  soon we will have 1 film and 1 paper 
left...thats assuming you aren't doing digital in the first place.
Anyway, buy and freeze all you can (i did with Ektalure) and use it wisely.
As for film/dev. combos, we use Xtol straight(is there any other 
way?!?) for 7 min. i believe (will have to check).

good luck

The rumor is here in the states as well but i think they are talking 
more on the format than film speed for halting certain films.

BTW, IMHO delta isn't the alternative.  if there is one, Pan F+ (by 
Ilford0 would be my recomendation.

Hello every body,

    Does any one has some development time suggestions for APX 25/ 120 and
135 in D76 1+1 and (or) Xtol 1+1 ( does the Kodak recommendation is OK ) ? I
should mention that I use a condenser  enlarger ( Durst 1200 ).
Many thanks

    Daniel

Ilford multigrade glossy, dektol.  I diluted with water.  Should I have
used something else?
I pretty much followed the directions on the bottle.

Sometimes I see a little dry down difference, but this was way more than that.

I'm coming into the thread late, so this may be a repeat, or off-top, but
this might help some of you.

I noticed over the last few years that sometimes prints (Agfa classic or
Zone IV VC-II) took on an overall stain or darkening of the image --- even
the white borders would look dull. I was using Kodak Rapid Selenium toner
diluted either 1:9 or 1:19, mixed in water.  I discovered that this problem
could be resolved *completely* by immersing the print (with agitation) for
1.5-2 minutes in Kodak's Hypo-clearing agent (or 1 Tbs of sodium sulfite in
a liter of water) before going into the toner.  The chemists among you can
explain it, I'm sure --- probably something about the ph.  Anyway, it works
like a charm.

I keep the steps separate because I doubt that the life of the sulfite and
the life of the toner are going to turn out to be the same.

I have been using APX 25-135 since Kodak discontinued Pan-X production (and
in many ways I prefer it!).

I develop it in Rodinal 50:1 - normal development for me is about 9 minutes,
which, I think, is about what Agfa suggests.

Hope this helps!

Shanon,  You will see differences with toners based on many factors; paper and
developer combinations, type and age of fixer, temperature of toner.  I have
been using Maco Selenium toner lately, although I have used many sheets of
Ilford Multi grade and Kodak selenium toner.  I use Ansco 130 most of the
time.  You will see some changes in density.  In the Maco tech sheet, they have
a chart for toning.  At 1:19 density is gained up to about 5 minutes, after
that you lose dmax.

I use selenium between 1:19 and 1:5 depending on paper and desired affects.
split toning/ combination with sepia, etc.

I also use a separate bath of clearing agent after toning.  There may be some
other things going on with the quality of water.  It has been HOT here in Texas
lately.


Hope this hope

EJ Neilsen

Shannon, you are absolutely right; selenium does add density to the print,
and you must print a tad lighter when you plan to tone, just as with sepia
bleach and tone you have to print a darker image than normal to compensate
for the reduction in print density that happens with that toner.They say
about 10% less development, or less than, for selenium.

OOPS!
 Left something out I see!   Sorry!
You need to Rt. click and highlight the email then click on "properties"
first..... then "Details"!
 I'm using Version 4.72  { I was told to just keep using this as it doesn't
have some of the Active X controls that viruses like.....not knowing any
better I just keep using it! :o) }
Hope I'm not confusing the issue even more.
BTW your email is in plain text according to the"details" window!

This jogs my memory about Shannon's comment that she "followed the 
instructions on the bottle."  Kodak (and, in my experience, far, far too 
many others) give lousy instructions on their packages!  I follow those 
given in their **free** publication on their toners.  To request it, call 
1-800-242-2424, x.19.  I think they also make 'em available via e-mail & 
fax, as well as reg. mail.  You'll see it recommends a dilution in working 
solution of wash aid, NOT water.

Some good, basic info on selenium toning, among many, many other topics, can 
be found in the following books, which are long-time faves of mine & readily 
available:

Steve Anchell's "The Variable Contrast Printing Manual" and
Henry Horenstein's "Beyond Basic Photography"

Good luck (and have fun, THE MOST IMPORTANT PART of the entire enterprise!)

Adrienne,
Do I remember correctly that one of the ingredients of Selenium is Hypo. If you
mix it with water and then follow the toning with a bath (1min+) in wash aid
followed by regular washing your toner last longer.

As I said earlier, I just follow the instructions given in Kodak's 
publication.  If memory serves me (I keep it in the darkroom which I rent, & 
I'm home now), they expressly recommend NOT washing it after toning in the 
selenium/wash aid mixture.

  Stock Kodak Rapid Selenium Toner is about 25% ammonium thiosulfate. The
thiosulfate is necessary for the reaction which produces silver selenide.
  In the presence of an acid KRST can deposit elemental Selenium on the
surface of the print resulting in a yellow stain. Its recommended that
prints (or film) to be toned in KRST be treated in either a sulfite wash
aid or in a bath of 2% carbonate or Kodalk. 
  While Kodak states that diluting KRST in Kodak Hypo Clearing Agent is OK,
that is _only_ for 1:20 or greater dilution, and only as a convenience to
eliminate the need for a separate bath in the wash aid. Since working
strength wash aid has a rather short life this is really not a good
procedure. 
  Prints can be toned directly out of the fixing bath but a sample should
be tested to see if a stain develops.
  Prints toned in KRST must be washed as though they had just been fixed.
Although the amount of hypo in the toner working solution is small it
should be washed out nonetheless. 
  Kodak recommends shorter wash times for prints which habe been completely
toned probably on the basis of the immunity to sulfiding from the hypo
given by complete toning. 
  While ther are more complete instructions available than those on the
bottle they are sufficient to use the toner.
  A note to those who use dilute KRST for premanence. It doesn't work. KRST
split tones. When used in high dilutions it will not tone the larger silver
particals in low density areas sufficiently to give them complete
protection from atmospheric polutants. 
  Doug Nishmura, of IPI, recommends using KRST for image protection at
dilutions of no more than 1:9 and for periods of not less than three
minutes at 68F (20C).
  I am preparing a paper on processing for permanence based on Dr.
Nishmura's work. I am still carrying on some discussions with him. At this
time it looks like the best bet for protecting images is Kodak Brown Toner
at about 1:25 for a couple of minutes. This produces a color change but not
a large one. The toned prints should be treated in a bath of wash aid for a
few minutes to stop the toning and thoroughly washed. 
  The recommendation to use diluted KRST for protection comes from a paper
by Lee, Wood, and Drago of Kodak, published many years ago. IPI discovered
about ten years ago that microfilm trated with KRST was developing "red
spots" or redox spots. They carried out extensive experimentation and found
that the protection in the Lee, Wood, and Drago experiments was evidently
due to incidental sulfiding of the silver by some impurity in the Selenium
toner. Current production toner does not have the impurity so doesn't
provide the image protection. IPI has a special polysulfide toner for
microfilm but it doesn't seem necessary to use it for prints or ordinary
pictorial film.
 Selenium toning does provide some protection even when not complete.
_Full_ toning in Selenium does protect the image as much as sulfiding but
the color change may not be acceptable for some images.
  More when I get things together. 
  I strongly recommend reading Dr. Nishimura's posts to the
rec.photo.darkroom group in the last couple of weeks.

Alexis thanks for the info, I am trying to find out from my supplier (one of 
the larger UK wholesalers) where his information came from, I can't imagine 
that the UK arm of AGFA would have taken it into their heads to discontinue 
the product on their onesome! But, well you never know. I shall be pretty 
cross if this were nothing but a ruse to bump up the monthly order.

Cheers....with fingers crossed!

Greetings-

you wrote:
> ...they expressly recommend NOT washing it after toning in the
selenium/wash aid mixture.

I must respectfully disagree.

Washing after selenium toning must be as thorough as the washing after
printing!!

Yes, KR Selenium *is* mixed with hypo (thus, one of the reasons for the
clearing bath);  And IMHO, no, it is *not* recommended mixing the toner with
a wash aid, as the wash aid has a very limited life - far, far shorter than
the toner's.

There has been extensive discussion and detailed postings about selenium on
the alt-photo-process list and is available in the archive.  I believe there
is a link to the archive at Malin's www.cyanotype.com page....

Further notes about selenium that may be of interest:

There are, broadly speaking, two categories of photographic papers
available:  there are bromide based, or cold-tone papers (Ilford MG among
them) - and then there are chloro-bromide, or warm tone papers (Ilford
Warmtone, Forte Fortezo, Agfa Portriga etc). They respond to selenium *very*
differently.

Cold tone papers will show little or no shift in print color (perhaps a
shift to blue or purple) with selenium, and its use is usually for enhanced
archival stability.  Many photographers, in fact, wish to avoid any color
shift - and so use quite dilute working strengths, or limit time in the
toner.  However, selenium does not tone evenly - it tones the shadows first,
the highlights tone last.  Richard Knoppow has recently posted extensively
on the importance of *complete* toning for complete archival protection.

On the other hand, warm tone papers often respond to selenium with strong
visual effects - in part because they have two types of silver molecules
(silver chloride *and* silver bromide), which accept the toner (all toners,
in fact) at different rates. In the case of fairly strong selenium, the
toning will easily create a split-tone effect: rendering the shadows a deep
plum-red and the highlights taking on a blue-green tinge, not unlike the
color of tarnish on copper.  With the right image it can be *very*
beautiful.

So, when you ask about dilutions and time in the toner I would have to ask,
"What are you trying to achieve?"

Hope this helps.

Best -

Jon

I have doubled checked with my wholesaler who has in turn checked with the 
product manager at AGFA UK and indeed production of APX25 is being withdrawn. 
 He reckoned (the product manager ) that AGFA, in Germany, had 6 months 
supply but that they expected this to reduce to 3 months when photographers 
started stocking up.  AGFA UK had one roll in stock!

I stick the fickle finger of photographic fate up at 'em all!

I am going back to having a good long sulk in Vancouver for a couple of weeks

Now I'm confused!  Would you be good enough to clarify, Richard, what seems 
to my addled brain to be a contradiction in your last post:

>   A note to those who use dilute KRST for premanence. It doesn't work. 
>KRST
>split tones. When used in high dilutions it will not tone the larger silver
>particals in low density areas sufficiently to give them complete
>protection from atmospheric polutants.

-SNIP-

>  Selenium toning does provide some protection even when not complete.

Thanks!  (And I will read Nishimura's rec.photo.darkroom posts as soon as I 
get the chance; off to the darkroom today!)

  Selenium toner split tones. It tones small particals selectively before
the larger particals. Its a matter of surface area vs: volume.
  Silver selenide is as stable as silver sulfide but the stability of the
image depends on how much of the silver has been converted. Because of the
split toning the very light toning done with highly diluted toner may leave
the lower density parts of a print or negative insufficiently toned to
protect the silver there from oxidation. 
  If toning is carried out far enough the amount of silver in the low
density areas which is converted to selenide becomes large enough to
protect them. 
  Any toning protects some of the silver particals and those toned tend to
be the ones most vulnerable to oxidation (they are also the ones most
easily toned). Nonetheless, light toning in diluted KRST, as has been
recommended for about twenty years, is not sufficient protection for prints
or negatives in a hostile environment, as most seem to be now. 
  Polysulfide toners, like Kodak Brown Toner, tone evenly. IPI recommends
about 65% conversion for image protection of microfilm. Print and pictorial
film emulsions are somewhat different. This degree of toning for microfilm,
and probably pictorial film, does not result in much change in the image
structure, density, or color, all important factors for microfilm. For
prnts there is likely to be a color shift towards brown with some papers.
Probably about the difference between a neutral to a warm tone paper. 
  Like Selenium toner the amount of density change and color shift will
depend on the emulsion being toned. Neutral and cold toned papers have
larger silver particals than warm toned paper so are toned by _all_ toners
more effectively. 
  Dr. Nishimura is on vacaton for a few days. I won't have answers to a
couple of final questions until he gets back. He has been kind enough to
post to the darkroom group and to engage with me and some others in private
e-mail. I've also talked to him on the phone a couple of times. 
  What I want to do is summarise what I have learned about toning and other
aspects of "archival" processing. I use the word in quotes because it is
really misleading. "Permanence" is probably a better term. 
  Archiving implys some control of storage conditions. The lifetime of
images in controlled storage is considerably longer than in un-controlled
storage, and much longer than when on display. I am concerned with display
life since most photographs are meant to be looked at. The processing and
treatment of photos to make their display life longer will also make their
storage life longer. 
  If this subject seems confusing its not just you. It IS confusing. That's
one reason I am so glad to see Dr. Nishimura posting, he is one of the
formost experts in this area.
  More when I have it.

  Probably about two stops down. That is pretty typical for lenses. 
  I can see the optimum of my Schneider lenses using a 25X Microsite grain

Some time ago  a company tried to market lenses that were always at the top
performance level. Almost all of the lenses were set to F/9. There was some
big hype about all of the reasons why F/9 was chosen but I doubt that there
is that much difference between F/8, F/9, and F/11. I did enlarging for
aerial mapping for a while and all of the enlargements were made at F/8 and
a dimmer switch was used for the light level.....I was always supposed to
use this setting unless the use of perspective controls mandated a smaller
F/stop to keep all of the image sharp. Richard mentioned using about 2 to 3
stops down and this would be about right. I do know that some Enlarging
lenses were purposefully given smaller f/stop ranges than the lens formula
allowed to keep within the range that had allowable sharpness.... just as
some of the Ziess lenses won't stop down past f/16 to stay within the
companies preferred limits.

^^^^^
  This should read _less_ effectively.
  The silver particals of warm toned emulsions are smaller than cold tone
emulsions. In fact, the size is one of the reasons for the brownish color.
The small size, and hence, larger surface to volume ratio, is why they are
toned faster than the larger sized particals in cold toned paper. 
  Sorry if I confused anyone.

I've heard that one way is to adjust the intensity of the white light 
shining on your viewing area (say, above the wash).  Making the light 
dimmer means you will judge a lighter print to be correct.

  Prints dry down. The effect of dry down is not simply looking darker
although that is the immediate visual effect. The more textured the surface
the more it suffers from dry down although even ferrotyped glossys suffer a
little. 
  Probably the only way to compensate is to make a series of prints varying
from too light to too dark and mark the prints as to how they look in the
darkroom while wet. 
  Then examine them again, when they are completely dried out, and see
which looks best.
  Certainly the level of illumination affects the visual judgment of
darkness. This is important when exhibiting a print since a print intended
to be viewed under fairly bright light will be too dark when viewed under
dim light. This is a a matter of contrast as well as brightness of the print. 
  The extrems are probably prints to be exhibited under the sort of
lighting recommended for extending the print life. By memory, the
recommended level is 45 lux, which is pretty dim. 
  At the other extreme is a print made to be viewed in a light box. Such
prints are very much more constrasy and much darker than a normal print.
When properly illuminated by reflected lights in a light box such a print
will look like a transparency. Under normal light it will look awful. 
  Toning adds another complication since some toners (Rapid Selenium)
intensify the print, darkening it and increasing the effective contrast,
and some toners (indirect sepia) tend to reduce the print, making it
lighter. There are no fixed rules for correcting for any of these effects,
they vary with emulsions, toners, etc. You must experiment to find what
settings you need for conrast, exposure, toning, etc., to get a print you
like for the illumination its going to be viewed under.

Shannon,
I'm a bit late to this thread
There is a good deal of detail and small print stuff about selenium which
you may or may not get interested in, but as you say this is the first time
you have used it, and in response to your question - first things first ;-)
You say that your prints got contrastier and darker. What usually happens
with cool and many neutral tone papers is that the depth of black in the
darkest tones gets deeper when the print is selenium toned. This maximum
black of a paper is referred to as Dmax. It is possible to measure the depth
or density of the darkest black a paper is capable of giving - and if you
give it  more exposure than that, it will not get any blacker (although the
other tones in the print obviously will ). Selenium will however take it to
a measurably deeper black, i.e. a new Dmax if you like (although
interestingly, prolonged selenium toning is said to lower the Dmax again).
The effect that has to the eye is that the blacks look richer, rather like
they did when the print was still wet. The whites may appear brighter in
comparison but are not actually affected in this way with the times commonly
used for toning. The print is sometimes descibed as having more luminosity
as a result of this.
The next thing to say perhaps is that all papers do NOT respond the same in
selenium toner. Cold bromide papers (v few around these days) look pretty
much unchanged when wet but show the above effects mostly on drying. Neutral
tone papers tend to 'cool off' in Se toner - some will then warm up or
change colour (commonly in a red/brown or purple/magenta direction -
depending on the paper) with prolonged or stronger toning. Warm tone papers
commonly show a marked colour shift to red/brown. Some papers have their own
particular idiosychratic response which may be particularly brisk or
colourful.
The response you see can also be significantly effected by the choice of
developer used and by the dev time.
On a different aspect, Se toner is also used to help protect prints against
attack by pollution. This is another story and less straightforward than
once assumed. There is much fruit for discussion here and no doubt this will
be opened up in this group. Richard has posted extensively on this in the
past. If it is of interest to you just say the word!

Can anybody answer the foloowing please.

This very expensive focus finder is supplied with a blue filter to =
assist in achieving the point of accurate focus.(Quote from Silverprint =
brochure).
What is the advantage of the blue filter-is it something to do with the =
eyes ability to focus in different lights?
Would using a standard focus finder and blue filtration with a colour =
head achieve the same?

  This is only a guess. I suspect the idea is that since graded B&W paper
is sensitive only to blue light that confining the spectrum viewed through
the focuser to blue would eliminate errors due to chromatic aberration in
the enlarging lens. If the magnifier in the Peak is decently designed it
should not itself have significant CA. Actually, no decent modern enlarging
lens should have enough chromatic to make a difference either. 
  Physiologically, the eye is most sensitive to fine detail in the green
region. It would be interesting to contact Peak and ask what they think
they are doing:-)

Tim--thanks for your informative post about the effects of selenium.
While prolonging the life of the print is always good, what really
interests me is increasing its luminosity, as you described it. I just
think toned prints look better.  One thing I like is the separation of
values in the middle range.  The prints I was toning were landscapes, and
toning seems to make details like leaves and small rocks more visible and
textural.

Today I am going to print these prints again larger and softer and lighter
and then tone them, washing them thoroughly before, during, and after with
hypoclear (which I didn't do before), and see if they look better this
second time around. I think it's just going to take some experimentation,
as several people have said, to learn how to make a print that looks right
after selenium toning.

One book I have--Basic Techniques of Photography, by John
Schaefer--recommends a hypo clearing bath before toning, diluting the toner
with hypo clear, and then a hypo clear bath after toning.  Three trays, all
with hypo clear in them, and the middle one with selenium toner also at a
10 percent solution.  That's a lot of hypo clear.

I'm not sure what this means--that the wash aid has a limited life and
therefore shouldn't be added to the toner.  Does it matter that the wash
aid has a limited life?  Aren't you going to wash it out with water at the
end anyway?

Thanks for all the links to other sources of information about selenium,
which I am going to check out today.

This very expensive focus finder is supplied with a blue filter to assist in
achieving the point of accurate focus.(Quote from Silverprint brochure).
What is the advantage of the blue filter-is it something to do with the eyes
ability to focus in different lights?
Would using a standard focus finder and blue filtration with a colour head
achieve the same?


I believe that the blue filter is intended to improve focusing accuracy by
ensuring that the visually perceived plane of sharp focus is the same as
that of the image-forming light " seen " by the printing paper. For example,
if one were printing the quick-and-dirty way by using the red swing filter
to compose and focus on the paper to be exposed, the red light of the visual
image, having a long wavelength, would focus in a different plane from the
shorter wavelength blue light which actually exposes the paper, resulting,
theoretically, in an unsharp print. Focusing with blue light, which as John
suggests could be done with any focus finder and blue filtration, would
solve this problem - although how seriously we should take it is open to
debate, given the depth of field available at the paper plane at any
reasonable working aperture.

No doubt there are those on the list who can quantify the blue/white light
discrepancy  and others ( or perhaps the same ones ) who have done practical
tests on the subject but, for the time being, I hope this helps.

what is the best way to get rid of used photo chemicals?  will they damage a
septic system?  i'd appreciate any suggestions.

i'm relatively new to the list.  i've been lurking to get a feel for list
topics.  most of the posts are way over my head, how well do you all suffer
rookies and other types of photographic fools?

regards,

Claus

I use the Peak. The blue filter is, as stated by others, to enable it in
theory to 'see' the same wavelength as the paper emulsion.
Many people think this is unnecessary &/or makes no perceptible difference.
I have tried with and without - can't see a difference in the final print -
but it is harder to use/focus  with the blue filter so I never use it.

Ansel Adams used to recommend adding Se toner to washaid. This is useful in
one way in that it shortens the process by cutting out a full wash for FB
papers  before Se toning. It also may help to prevent Se staining by
changing the Ph (acidity/alkalinity) - as others have already said.

However, it has disadvantages too: it has been shown that the protection to
the print given by using Se toner this way (putting aside for the moment
where that protection actually comes from) is less than that achieved by
using washaid & wash first and then Se toning. The other consideration is
that Se toner even when diluted lasts for ages and stores well. Washaid on
the other hand does not - when diluted for use it lasts only hours, so it
makes some sense to use separately. Consequently I don't recommend using Se
toner mixed with washaid.

The other issue you mention is that of using washaid after Se toning. There
is much amm. thiosulphate (rapid fixer) in Kodak Se toner and using washaid
after toning shortens the final wash as it does after fixing. I have
discussed this with Kodak in the past and they tell me that it also improves
washing out Se components that should be cleared from the print (apart from
thiosulphate) - but they were not able to tell me exactly why.

Welcome,
We all have to start somewhere and enthusiasm is the best trait I know of!
 As far as septic tanks are concerned I have used color and B&W chemistry
for 15 years in the septic system at the house we now live in and many more
years in an assortment of other septic systems. No problems so far. Too much
wash water may be your biggest problem if you don't have adequate drainage
for washing papers. There are restrictions in some areas against dumping
darkroom chemicals down the drain and using a silver recovery drum {$25. to
$200. US } will usually take care of that. A call to Kodak at 1-800-242-2424
asking about pamphlets on the subject might help. Kodak has several
different papers on the subject.

You may want to read Dr. Robert Chapman's column, "Photo Chemicals in
Septic Systems" pp 16-19 in Photo Techniques, Mar/Apr 2000, Vol 21, No.2.
In short, he says don't worry about it.

There's also some interesting reading at The Silver Council's web site at
<http://www.silvercouncil.org>. And "RCRA in Focus: Photo Processing," an
Adobe Acrobat file available at the EPA's Office of Solid Waste RCRA
[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act] In Focus web page at

This topic was discussed (rather heatedly) not too long ago in
rec.photo.darkroom. A deja search should turn up the postings.

There is a tape { I don't remember the name of it } that is specially made
for attaching the "skirt" to the original negative or transparency. The
special tape is dimensionally stable and I believe sold by Kodak. Placing a
"skirt" on the neg is called "stripping in" and can be done by using a
larger piece of film or even paper made for the printing industry { gold
something but actually photosafe orange. }. I haven't done it for a while
but there are punches that punch the film or paper and pins that are used to
place on a glass bottom sheet that are made of a flat tab on the bottom and
a 1/4 inch pin that sticks up. You tape the pins in place and use the mask
and "stripped original" by sliding them over each other on the pins.

We save our photo chemical waste in used plastic disinfectant containers
and get rid of it at our bi-annual hazardous waste disposal days
organized by our local city.

Well, the goofballs at AT&T @Home are giving me so much grief about running
web & mail servers (even though they're not for profit), I am being forced to 
change internet providers.  This means that sometime in the next 45 days
or so, there is going to be a pure-silver outage.  If I know ahead of
time, I'll warn you all about it.  However, if @Home suddenly pulls
the plug w/o telling me, this list could be dead for up to 4-6 
weeks (I hope this will not happen).  If this happens, be patient, I will
be on the air again using a Covad DSL connection sometime early this Fall.
Once all is well, I will send a note to the group to let you know we are
alive an well.

Sorry about this, but there is literally nothing I can do about this.

Incidentally, the reason they pitched a fit was because of a spam attack
on this list in early August.  Either someone on the list complained
to the abuse authority of the spam sender (not realizing that my server
would be the one implicated), or, when the spammer subscribed to the
list, they did not unsubscribe, and all pure-silver mail was being
attempted to be sent back to them - and their ISP objected.  To avoid
this in the future, I have now closed the list - NOBODY subscribes without
my explicit permission.

A few neutral to cold papers, for example try MG111 and  and if pushed but
less so MG1V (RC) with very prolonged toning. It's a purplish magenta [- I'm
a BW photographer rather than a colour printer;-)]

Just curious:

I went to office depot today and pass by some office punchs
that displayed there. The recent 'hot' unsharp masking, pin
registration came across my mind....

When I play around the office punchs, there is one thing
that I don't quite understand how it can be used for pin
registration for our films:

The office punchs produce holes that are 1/4 inch, and this
is too big, isn't it ? Even a 8x10 negative, its clear film base
edge is smaller(not that wide) than 1/4 inch. how can a office
punch can be used ?

Best,
C.J. Cheng

I have used S.toner as a one shot chemical for use on large prints per
Kodak's recommendation for sq inch / per oz. of diluted solution. I liked
the thought of the toner helping in the archival process but in 30x40 prints
it gets expensive and with the recent info passed on by Richard and others
seems to be less than the protection I wanted. My question is how many
sq/inches per oz of 1 to 9 would be the best guess for one shot use  {Kodak
didn't have an accurate answer for me on this as they still say that far
less than 1 to 9 is just dandy.. I don't mind re-using it so is there any
way except tables of oz/per sq. inches to know when it exhausts. I am
presently stuck with Ilford MGIV fiberbase as the only large roll paper I
can easily purchase. It does not seem to have much of any visible change
when I tone it......so visible clues seem to be out.
 The second question is concerning Brown toner and Ilford MGIV fiberbase and
AZO papers and if I can get the archival results without turning the paper
too brown. I've not used it before and will probably try to order some next
week. I'm planing to use -1:25 for a couple of minutes- as per Richards
advice. Any comments on this would be welcome!
Thanks
Chuck

  Its almost impossible to put a figure on the capacity of something like
Selenium toner. The selenium is used up as it converts the silver. The more
dark areas in the print, the more silver there is to tone. Also, the
further toning is allowed to progress the more toner is used.  So,
capacities, like the rough one Kodak gives on the bottle for 1:3 dilution,
are no more than guestimates based on an avarage. 
  I don't know of any sure fire test of KRST. I have found that toned
images are resistant to ferricyanide bleach, as used for indirect sepia
toning, but don't know if that resistance is a valid measure of toning. 
  Dr. Nishimura is on vacation for a week or so. I posted a couple of
specific questions about recommended toning procedures to him just before
he left so I won't have answers back until he returns. I caution that he
has suggested somewhere, either in one of his posts or in his
correspondence with me, that there is no universal procedure for paper
prints. IPI's work was done with microfilm. They devised a modified
polysulfide toner for use with it. It is somewhat different than Kodak
Brown Toner, but again, was formulated specifically to deal with microfilm
permanence. Brown Toner is easier to obtain than the special toner, which
must be mixed from scratch although I believe IPI has kits for it. I will
post the formula if there seems to be good reason to. Right now I have no
idea if it has any advantage over Kodak Brown Toner for pictorial use. I
also asked if there was any simple way of modifying Brown Toner to make it
more suitable for our sort of use. I expect to get answers ( or at least "I
don't knows") in a few days. 
  Keep in mind that Selenium toner _will_ provide image protection,
provided its allowed to tone long enough. Its the highly diluted treatment
that doesn't work. I suspect that there is no toner which will provide
protection without changing the image color somwhat, although the change
may be slight. 
  Tim Rudman has also been corresponding with Doug and may have information
that I don't. 
 More when I have it.

Mr. Hall,

You wrote:
> Question. Which papers/developers turn magenta in Se Toner?

Well, that's a deceptively simple question.  I see from your signature line
that you are involved with lith-printing - and that, as I understand it, has
changed the entire landscape of toning for visual effects....

However, to try to keep this response as simple as possible - and as useful
as possible - you won't go far wrong starting with almost any warmtone
paper.  I am referring to papers such as: Forte Fortezo [or Bergger, I'm
told they are the same], Ilford Warmtone MG, Kentmere Warmtone, Luminos
warmtone papers [made by Kentmere?], and to a lesser extent, Agfa Portriga -
among others, I'm sure.  These papers, generally speaking, developed without
any special processes or considerations will accept SE toning very well,
responding with the magenta color (or "plum-reds" I mentioned in an earlier
post) you asked about, usually in split-tone combination with the blue-green
tinges in the highlights.

You ask about developers: I happen to use Zonal Pro "HQ Warmtone" liquid
developer.  It is a 100% hydroquinone developer which, I understand,
facilitates all papers to accept subsequent toning.

As far as the selenium toner goes: This really is *NOT* rocket science!!  I
suggest you start with approx 12:1 working strength toner; take a well
washed, pre-soaked print (select several images - and especially images with
a wide range of values) and place it in a tray of toner with a *good* light
source right over the tray.  It would be helpful in the beginning to have an
untoned version of the same print nearby - within handy view of the toning
tray - to use as a reference.  The early effects of the toner are subtle
enough that an eye unused to detecting the changes as they happen over
several minutes benefit from having the comparison print - the changes
become *obvious* (really!) when there is a comparison print.

Toning of this sort can take as little 2-3 minutes with fresh toner and the
"right" image on the "right" paper - to 10 or more minutes with toner that's
seen some use, and/or with a given image and paper combination.  I have
noticed that Multi-Grade papers take significantly longer to split (turn
magenta in the shadows and blue-green in the highlights) then do graded
papers, even from the same manufacturer.

But please understand: this is not - and can never be - about obtaining a
predetermined look on demand. With toning: you get what you get.  One gets
involved with toning for visual effects in order to find out what a given
image will look like when toned.  It cannot be predicted - if it could it
wouldn't interest me!

>From my vantage point toning is about sidestepping a willful, determined
approach to image making.  After 26 years, I have come to a place where I am
happy to entrust myself completely to the photographic materials and to the
processes - to become a midwife to the images.  I am either interested in
the results or I'm not.  They either work, or they don't. It's an enormously
generous medium! - I make *lots* of images, I can afford to throw some away.
It takes a certain amount milk to float up the cream....  It seems to me
that this is the only way we can ever hope to see something *new* -
otherwise we continue to create that which we've already seen and know, ad
nauseum.

But Lordy, I'm off discussing *theory* - treacherous and dangerous ground.
Perhaps I should stop.... But this is one aspect of photography I'm most
interested in.  (Shameless plug): If this interests you, perhaps you should
consider signing on for my class next month in Breckenridge, Colorado.
E-mail me directly (mailto:quryhous@midcoast.com) if you would like to
receive a package of visuals and some background....

with sincere best wishes to one and all -

The effect of dry down is caused by the expansion of the wet paper in
constriction when dried down.

With the pores of the paper closed when dry the dark silver is intensified
without the space.

It had been discovered by extensive trial and error that the dry-down is
about 10% but can be from 5% to 10% and can only be determined by your own
trial and error.

It is achieved by printing two or three prints, dryingthem and seeing which
time works for that print, that day, that developer.

On toning, I recommend Ansel's book on the print; or the new version on
Darkroom Techniques (or the old version if you can find it)

The orangeish-amber stuff is called goldenrod, don't know why.  If I need to
mask something I prefer to use rubylith, it's clear acetate with a red film
on it. Take an exacto knife or something like it, cut out your mask and peel
off the red.

Richard's synopsis above is as always pot on. The Se toner from Kodak just
gets slower as it gets used up and eventually the effort to wring the last
from it becomes not worthwhile, but as Richard says, it does depend on the
type of prints you are toning and of course how far you tone them. If toning
for pictorial effect on warm papers, you can see when you have the effect
you want. If using for protection on cooler papers it is much harder to
know. There are challenge tests used to determine the effects of toning in
terms of protection against pollutants - I'm not sure if this is what you
are asking though. I suspect not. Richard is right in that generally
speaking Se toned prints are pretty resistant to Ferricyanide bleaches,
however, stronger more aggressive bleaches are used together with
densitometry to challenge the effect of Se toning - notably Dichromate
bleach. Although used for research on paper 'archiving' in various fine art
and conservation centres both in the US and in Europe, this is also a useful
bleach to have for various pictorial/artistic effects, and is one of half a
dozen bleaches that I keep a permanent stock of in my darkroom. If you want
the formula I will be happy to post it here - or you can find it in my
books. I'm not sure if this is the sort of thing you want to pursue though?
(It's a lot more practical for individuals than a Hydrogen peroxide
incubation test!)

Ah, I hope I didn't misunderstand and thus mislead you Robert. I had a
particular effect in mind when I wrote about purple/magenta from selenium. I
saw you were involved in lith printing, which as you know is an area of
interest for me, and assumed rightly or wrongly (?) that you were not
referring to this.
My answer would appear to contradict Jonathan's - in fact we are just
referring to different colours. I was not talking about the much warmer
colours of warm tone papers - hence 'purple/magenta'. These come from some
cooler papers. There are other ways to get these colours though, slow weak
bleaching of some lith prints in highly diluted ferri for example - or
bleach and redev using an alternative bleach before Se toning can give you
deep purple blacks with the right paper, as can gold with some lith prints
before moving on to blue etc.

Not in the UK it isn't Richard. Kodak don't export it. They wouldn't even
send me some when they sent me their new sepia to test out - against company
policy. I have to pick it up when visiting the US and carry it home.  ;-((

The rubylith _IS_ an integral part of my darkroom......I use a sheet of it
over a B&W TV set.  :o)  Works great as a safelight and might just have a
few_ other_ advantages when I'm waiting on something mechanical to finish so
that I can get started again.. I know that this is sacrilegious to some but
I sometimes use an auto processor for both color and B&W testing to remove
any variables.:o)

Thanks for the responses and I'll be looking forward to any other info
available. Will be waiting for Richards paper on toning to make changes to
my art prints.This is the third or fourth time since I started into
photography that I've had to redo my thoughts on the permanence of my
prints. The oldest prints I personally have are from around 1966 and
thankfully they are still in great shape....being a young-un' at that time
and working in my first pro lab the images have no real artistic merit but
knowing that they survive intact and untoned is  definitely a +....... Some
of the images I have that are toned from the same time period are not doing
as well. The same time period was responsible for some of those "antique"
photos of folks dressed in 1800's clothing and sepia toned.....dang things
won't ever go away!  :o)

Yet Bruce Barnbaum, an excellent exhibition printer, says there is no dry
down effect and if you view with a weak light in the darkroom after printing
there will be no change when the print is viewed dry.

Mr. Smith:

As a new (and, until now, lurking) member of the Pure-Silver Mailing List, but a long-time denizen of the Olympus Mailing List (not to mention half-a-dozen others), I can tell you that the type of message you posted above does nothing at all except piss people like me off.

The original sender of this spam (also know as Unsolicited Commercial E-Mail [UCE]) will never see your reply.  In fact, they like to make it very difficult to even find them, except through 1-800 telephone numbers or other methods which they can easily throttle and/or hide behind.  The e-mail address in the "From:" field, "ukmnb123@yahoo.com," is almost certainly forged.

In addition, since this was actually sent to a mailing list, it's almost certain that the person sending the UCE used a commercial bulk-spamming package (or a commercial service, which is worse) with millions of unverified e-mail addresses.  Such packages/services never distinguish between real e-mail, "dead" addresses or addresses going to lists like Pure-Silver.

Don't bother replying to it again.  If the Administrator of this list really wants to, it's possible (albeit a pain in the rear) to stop these things from getting on the List, but your best defense is a sense of humour.  On the Oly List, several of these UCEs have led to some pretty funny reply strings.

Finally, if you (or anybody else on the list) receives UCE with a valid reply address, DON'T send them a reply saying something like "Leave me alone"; this merely tells the spammer that they've got a "live" e-mail address (as opposed to the hundreds of thousands of dead links in these bulk lists), and you go into a special, high-quality list from which you'll get spammed all the more often.  Just trash the e-mail, and get on with life.

Tim,

Thanks for the clarification. I was assuming that one could reach a magenta
without playing the bleach/redev games. ;-) Your book is a great source for
that. It was somewhat of an idle question, but still honest curiosity, to
know what papers will yield colors other than the typical cold/blue tones
given by se. And as always, I keep playing to see what I'll get.

Their se toner is different from KRST  (or is it different to? I can never
remember!)
Firstly it is a 3% solution whereas KRST is 2% and Fotospeed 1.9% (for
export controls or some such - not significant in practice). They also claim
that it is of much higher 'purity'  (??)

Thank you Garth
Perhaps I could add that if you find the urge to reply irresistable
(although pointless) don't share it with the rest of the group. Your
responses are worse than the original spam and will offend many

There has been much put forth on the selenium toning issue here. I would really
recommend that any not set in stone to give the selenium toner by Maco a try.
It produces , at least for me, better enhanced Dmax than Kodak's with different
colors as well.  I have no stake in there company, just very happy with the
results.  I have been conducting some side by side toning experiments with
Seagull VC, Ilford MG, Cachet VC, David Lewis' Bromoil Paper, and Agfa.

While I may have missed it, those interested in selenium toning for color,
should note that what you see wet may not match what you see after washing and
drying.  as several have pointed out, have fun.

Chuck,

I believe there were many who invested in the venerable Dr. Goodblood's
franchise to enjoy the benefits of Q&D (quick and dirty) diffusion transfer
materials... in those instances it was the Agfa Copyproof sepia positive
from the paper negative. Somehow... there are still a few in business in
the occasional shopping mall. The increase in computer technology has
greatly reduced copy camera use in the printing industry and it won't be
too long until the process disappears from the market.

 The same time period was responsible for some of those "antique"

To List members,

An apology for my response. I have the e-mail programmed to respond
automatically to language on e-mail used by most of the spammers and
apparently one got responded to that was posted on the pure silver list.

In spite of those who e-mailed me about responding getting me more spam,
since getting rude as hell with the auto response message I send back to
them, the numbers have dropped to only one or two every few weeks.

The sender did explain how this happened (it was an automated response).

However, it is out of place - one more incident (by anyone) and I will
indeed remove the individual in question... Consider this fair 
warning.

  Snipping here. 

  I think dry-down is caused in some way by changes in the gelatin between
wet and dry conditions. The paper base of both fiber and RC paper is
"sized" so the emulsion does not lie directly on the paper. Fiber paper has
one or more coatings of quite hard gelatin with a dispersion of Barium
sufate in it to form a highly reflecting surface (the Baryta layer). RC
paper has a layer of plastic with a dispersion of Titanium dioxide to form
the reflecting layer. In both cases the paper texture does not show through. 
  The fact that dry down occurs with RC paper, where the paper itself does
not get wet, suggests the paper itself is not the culprit for either type
of support. 
  Even the glassy smooth RC glossy surface suffers from it to some extent,
which suggests its not completely a function of the smoothness of the
emulsion surface changing from wet to dry. This certainly is part of the
effect since dry down is much more noticable in matt surface paper than
glossy. I think there may be more than one contributing cause, the surface
scattering bein g only one of them. I think it may also have something to
do with the way the silver is held in the gelatin. The gelatin shrinks as
the emulsion drys. I have no ready explanation of how this would affect
density but the dry emulsion may cause some scattering the wet emulson does
not. 
  Dry down seems to vary considerably among papers, even with the same
surface.

  These are curious claims. Since KRST is a concentrate the concentration
of selenium in the toner shold simply affect the amount it must be diluted
for use. Purity is a curious claim. For one thing (as I suspect you know)
photo grade chemicals do not need to be highly purified as long as they are
free from residues of photo-active substances. Using very pure chemicals,
like AR grade, is fine but very expensive an usually unnessary. 
 The Kodak formula is proprietary, although you can get a pretty good idea
of what is in it from the MSDS. There is also a patent for Se toner with
thiosulfate in it. I have not gotten a copy. The reference is in _Theory of
the Photographic Process_ revised edition, C.E.K.Mees, in the section on
toners. 
  There are other forms of Se toners. Mostly they have sulfiding agents in
them along with the Selenium. The above toners may be this type. If you can
get hold of the MSDS (they MUST be availble in the US) it will tell you at
least what type of toner they are. 
  Its possible that if the produce sulfiding concurrently with Se toning
they may well yield protected images with partial toning. 
  Kodak Poly Toner, and Agfa Viradon, are combinations of a polysulfide
toner with Selenium. In the Lee, Wood, and Drago paper Poly Toner was shown
to give protected images but changed the image structure (form of the
silver crystals) more than the KRST they used. 
  Again, the KRST used for this paper had something in it which caused some
sulfiding. It was the sulfiding which gave the image protection at very
high dilutions, not the Se. This sulfiding  component was evidently an
impurity in one of the ingredients, KRST has not caused sulfiding for at
least ten years, probably longer, since the microfilm tested by IPI about
ten years ago must have been treated sometime before that. 
  I don't know if IPI has tested using either Poly Toner or Viradon.

My apologies to you and yours that this happened.  However, allow me
to point out that you (or anyone else) are not forced to read
pure-silver - membership or lack thereof is voluntary. You are
free to unsubscribe at any time if this troubles you so.

Nobody was attacking your family - you evidently felt no need to 
supervise your childrens use of the computer.  The internet is an
essentially uncontrolled forum, anyone with children should
act accordingly (I do as regards to my family).

Now then, your outrage (if a bit over the top) is understandable, however
attacking my integrity seems quite unfair.  So far as I can recall this is
only the first or second time this has ever happened in almost 5 years of
pure-silver operation.  I see no reason to over-react because one person
happened to have an autoresponder running that offended you.

My integrity is intact, thank you.  If your *free* access to this list and
your *unwillingness* to monitor the material available to your household
cause this much of a problem, I would gently suggest you unsubscribe since
I cannot proactively prevent what others might choose to say here.  You
will find unsubscribe instructions in the URL below...

I have a small Microwave in the darkroom....it seems to work in about 1
minute to dry the fiber base materials and Ciba prints to a point that is
very similar to the dry print. Saves time and worry. Also makes heating
solutions quick and easy. I use a strip or in the case of small prints the
whole print.  With large prints I use a test section on the area that has
the most delicate white. I also use a piece of paper that has Dmax black and
paperbase white + a slightly exposed white tone on it that stays in the wash
tray while printing and is brought out to use for judging  the extremes. I
don't know if this will help others but I thought I would mention it.

  I don't think this is a lack of integrety but rather a recognition of the
realities of life as they apply to the internet. Dan made a mistake by
setting up an auto responder. Not because of the message, but because it
tells spammers he is actually there. Spammers are scum, they are corrupting
a medium never intended for advertising because they can use it essentially
free. The sort of anger they engender, and the frustration of relative
helplessness against them can result in strong language. The spammers never
see it, unless they are like the jerk who was playing games with me a year
or so ago. 
 In short, cut Dan some slack. We are none of us delicate flowers (I hope).
Certainly we must expect people to be accountable for the consequences of
their words (or would that put too many politicians and talk show hosts out
of their jobs?). But strong language surrounds us. We have so far confused
freedom of speech with license that no one with a working TV or radio can
escape hearing every day the sort of language one used to hear only in the
stoke-hold.
  If your kids saw this you need to explain to them that frustrated people
often use the language of violence as a substitute for violence itself. It
may be a good opportunity to teach them how fine the line is between
violent language and actual violence. If you don't teach them they are not
going to learn it anywhere else. We have become shockingly tollerant of
violence as depicted in the mass media and as practiced in real life. This
tollerance starts with lack of socialization of children. This _must_ be
the responsibility of parents. Its not going to be done if you leave it to
someone else. 
  So, cut Dan some slack and sit down with your kids.
 End of sermon.

The way I compensate for this is, I set the timer for three seconds and
push the button the number of times I need to get the amount of time I need
(say, eight times for 24 seconds). Then when I have a print I like, at the
right density, I set the timer back to 2.8 seconds and push the button the
same number of times, so that the actual time the paper is exposed is about
eight percent less than the first time, to account for dry down changes,
which are observable to me.

In my toning experiments yesterday, I set the timer back to 2.6, 2.4, and
2.2 to test different percentages of compensation for toning plus dry down.
I haven't looked at the prints dry yet, as they are at the university, but
when I decide which is best, I'll let the list know.

Since toning also appears to me to intensify contrast, I also went down a
notch on the filter when printing the prints to be toned.  That is, the
"good" untoned print was exposed with a #2.5 filter for 24 seconds (timer
set to 2.8 for dry down).  The prints to be toned were exposed with a #2.0
filter and various times as noted above.

So, in other words, if you dilute selenium with washaid (in our case at U
of H, orbit bath), you shouldn't try to save this dilution for later, even
if you only toned a few prints in it?

At U of H we dilute the orbit bath sometimes in large quantities and keep
it in big five gallon dispensers for people to use in the darkroom. If it's
true that diluted orbit bath doesn't last very long, should we be worried
about this?  The other darkrooms I've worked in do the same thing.

Because of today's unfortunate fist fight, here are the steps I am (will be)
taking to try and keep things at an appropriate level from here on out:

1) The list is now closed; subscription requires my approval.

2) The mailer daemon on the pure-silver server is now using Paul
   Vixie's rbl spam management database.

3) Anyone using vulgar or sexually explicit language will be kicked off
   the list the *first* time it happens whether it is inadvertent (as was
   the case today) or intentional.

4) I will update the pure-silver web page to reflect this policy.

Although this person has left the list, there are some facts you all should
know:

The message was read by his young child - she was evidently pretty shook up
by the content.

This child is (according to the subscriber) dying from an incurable form
of cancer - surely we can undertand the anger and frustration of a father
in his situation.

I have contacted him privately and apologized profusely.  I pointed out
that the only reason I am not taking action is because the original
post was unintentional and not directed at anyone, certainly not this
list or him in particular.  I have also invited him/his daughter back
to this list - something to ponder the next time we post.

I, for one, am not a saint:  I certainly know how to be a potty mouth when
the occasion arises.  However, I am particularly careful when I speak in
public forums like this one, because you really never do know who might
be listening.

Once you mix the sulfite solution used to clear the paper or film it will
normally exhaust itself within a few hours. Check on the activity of your
brand of hypo clear by doing a residual fixer test with it after mixing a
fresh batch & then with some  mixed & in the open as well as in the
container after a few hours and days & see if it changes.

With all the recent mail on glass negative carriers the subject of optimium

John
Why not ask Rodenstock? I got some very helpful advice on my 80mm Apo
Rodagon which was underperforming compared to non-apo lenses. (It had to be
used at f5.6 and at above 10x before improvements over the non-apo versions
were shown).
I have conducted controlled as closely controlled practical tests as I could
with all my 12 enlarging lenses for my new book, and all of them were at
their best in sharpness terms (this ignores questions of lighting evenness
and rectilinear drawing) 2 stops down from open aperture. Some matched this
at one stop down, but didn't better it. My conclusions clash with those of
Ctein who claims that performance is better at only 1/2 stop down in most
cases I seem to remember in his magazine articles.
My tests were not with focal lengths for 5x4 however. For the record, an
ancient Leitz Focotar f4.5 five element enlarging lens bettered all the
current crop of top name enlarging lenses I used. A close second was a
Meopta.
When corresponding about glass/glassless carriers, another thought did occur
to me John - this was to wonder how flat the film in the camera lies in its
'glassless' carrier. I see in this week's British Journal of Photography
that there is an article there on this very issue. It concludes that it does
lie flat, but doesn't present proper information on measurement methods are
run proper controls. However, the photograph I n the article does appear to
show a measurement device.

This is not just a fallacy, it is specifically misleading. Prints made using
this filter will be LESS sharp, not more. I have used it for the last 10
years, and found out by practical experiments, reported in 'Elements', that
results were worse with the filter than the magnifier without the filter.
Since, I have read articles by Ctein that explain why this is so, and he
reported conclusions by another photographer, Patrick Gainer published in
the Jan/Feb 1997 issue of Photo Techniques, that further confirm this. Just
to add to the problems, I have to report that all my 5 focus magnifiers
using an aerial image show sharpness at different points with the same
negative/enlarger/lens set-up! The very expensive Peak does NOT produce the
sharpest results. As a matter of fact, the sharpest results on a repeatable
basis come from ground glass type magnifiers.
So don't fall for this blue-rinse photographic old wives' tale John!

Graham Max wrote:
I believe that the blue filter is intended to improve focusing accuracy by
ensuring that the visually perceived plane of sharp focus is the same as
that of the image-forming light " seen " by the printing paper. For example,
if one were printing the quick-and-dirty way by using the red swing filter
to compose and focus on the paper to be exposed, the red light of the visual
image, having a long wavelength, would focus in a different plane from the
shorter wavelength blue light which actually exposes the paper, resulting,
theoretically, in an unsharp print. Focusing with blue light, which as John
suggests could be done with any focus finder and blue filtration, would
solve this problem - although how seriously we should take it is open to
debate, given the depth of field available at the paper plane at any
reasonable working aperture.

No doubt there are those on the list who can quantify the blue/white light
discrepancy  and others ( or perhaps the same ones ) who have done practical
tests on the subject but, for the time being, I hope this helps.

Graham
This assumes of course that the paper is purely responsive to blue light in
the range of the filter They aren't - especially VC papers. Also, the
dimness of the blue filtered image of the Peak makes it more difficult to
see the image to focus. I repeat. The blue filter theory is fallacious
anyway, and the practice shows it making sharpness significantly worse, not
better.

Ansel Adams used to recommend adding Se toner to washaid. This is useful in
one way in that it shortens the process by cutting out a full wash for FB
papers  before Se toning. It also may help to prevent Se staining by
changing the Ph (acidity/alkalinity) - as others have already said.

However, it has disadvantages too: it has been shown that the protection to
the print given by using Se toner this way (putting aside for the moment
where that protection actually comes from) is less than that achieved by
using washaid & wash first and then Se toning. The other consideration is
that Se toner even when diluted lasts for ages and stores well. Washaid on
the other hand does not - when diluted for use it lasts only hours, so it
makes some sense to use separately. Consequently I don't recommend using Se
toner mixed with washaid.

The other issue you mention is that of using washaid after Se toning. There
is much amm. thiosulphate (rapid fixer) in Kodak Se toner and using washaid
after toning shortens the final wash as it does after fixing. I have
discussed this with Kodak in the past and they tell me that it also improves
washing out Se components that should be cleared from the print (apart from
thiosulphate) - but they were not able to tell me exactly why.

TTim, did I not once read too that the sodium sulphite in the wash-aid
gradually turns to sodium sulphate when mixed with Se toner this way. Since
sodium sulphate hardens the emulsion, it greatly slows down washing
afterwards. Sure I read this somewhere, but can't remember where.

The one I did at 2.6 (X 8) looked the best wet.  When I go over to the dark

Hi folks,
	To Mr. Daniel Buzard: I have just developed a APX 25 (135 format)
using D76 pure (no dilution) at 68F (20C). The procedure I used was:
	- pre-soak the film with water at 68F (30s to 1min)
	- developed with D76 (stock) for 7min at 68F, initial agitation 10s
then 5s each 30s
	- stop with water 15s to 20s
	- fixed with kodak's fixer (3min), constant agitation
	- washed in running water for 10min
	- final wash with PhotoFlo

	I hope this helps even though you asked a suggested time for D76
1+1.


	Regards,

	Helio

Hello every body,

    Does any one has some development time suggestions for APX 25/ 120 and
135 in D76 1+1 and (or) Xtol 1+1 ( does the Kodak recommendation is OK ) ? I
should mention that I use a condenser  enlarger ( Durst 1200 ).
Many thanks

    Daniel

Is Kodak Brown toner the same as the "Polysulfide toner"?  The latter is =
very easy to make once you get some "liver of sulfur".  Smelly, though.

Just to try something different yesterday, I mixed KRST 1:9 in perma-wash.
I made up about 40 ounces at 70 deg.  I toned 6 16x20 MGIV FB prints.
What I found amazing was the profound color change in just 3 or 4
minutes.  My experience, as with others, had been to observe very little
change after 8 or 9 minutes when diluted 1:20 and processed at 80 degrees.
Given the fact that I used only 40 ounces of solution and got plenty of
coverage in a 16x20 tray, I think I will stick with this regimen from now
on.

Just a point of mudding the waters-

Are selemiun and Brown toners the only canadates being considered in the preservation question? Are other toners being investigated?

It should also be noted that Dan Smith has been a frequent contributor
to this and other lists and has given many of us useful and
authoritative advice.  This takes knowledge, experience and integrity. 
To 'remove' him from the list would be an act of intolerable censure
which would offend a good many list members.

Does anyone know where to purchase (in the UK) a Stouffer 31-step Density
Tablet as mentioned in Steve Anchell's Variable Contrast Printing Manual -
either projection or contact printing.

Hope the reorganisation of this site goes Ok, some gem pieces of info for
the likes of me.

Thanks

Claus,

While many of the posts are way over MY head as well (being a relative 
novice of 6-7 years in the darkroom), I appreciate the opportunity to learn 
from the more accomplished members of this group, who have proven time & 
time again to be generous with their time & knowledge & explanations.

I love this quote, passed on years ago by I can't remember who:
"There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers!"  (Read:  naivete can 
be cured, snobbishness cannot!)

Regards,

Adrienne

Eric,

Could you advise where this may be found?  Being a stubborn, "off-the-grid / 
boycott multinational conglomerates" type of person, I'd love to switch away 
from Big Yellow!  I don't recall having seen this brand anywhere.

Thanks.

Adrienne

Eric,

Could you advise where this may be found?  Being a stubborn, "off-the-grid / 
boycott multinational conglomerates" type of person, I'd love to switch away 
from Big Yellow!  I don't recall having seen this brand anywhere.

Thanks.

Adrienne

As an avowed b&w and darkroom ADDICT, as well as a committed vegetarian, I 
would like to pose a question to all list members (several of whom are quite 
"chemically sophisticated"), which I haven't yet seen addressed.

Short of "going digital" (unthinkable for a long list of reasons), are any 
of you aware of non-animal (gelatin) versions of B&W film or paper 
emulsions?  Or am I so in the dark(room) I don't even realize animal 
by-products aren't even used anymore?

This question is really plaguing me; Richard Knoppow's recent post 
concerning the "sizing" of both fiber & RC paper bases adds yet another step 
in the process in which animals are used for photographic purposes.

I realize I may be opening myself up to ridicule by some members, but it is 
a risk I am willing to assume.  Any assistance/advice would be appreciated.

Regards,

Adrienne

There are several Alternative- Process (coat your own) products available (e.g. Gum Bichromate, Cynotype, ect.) from several web sites . If you are
talking about a commercially available equivalent of the film/papers on the market( Kodak, Ilford, Agfa) I don't know of any. Although research for a
gelatin substitute has been on-going for decades.

You may also request a catalog, they will hapilly send it for free.
They have calibrated step tablet which, when used with a comparator
(like the Ilford EM10) will make a pretty good densitometer for cheap !
(The manipulation involved are a bit complicated, but such a tool is not
of constant use in the darkroom...)

Hi,

I have been using Xtol since its release, and can definitely confirm that
the 100ml of developer per 80 square inches of film is necessary. I have
tried using less in tests, and severe under-development occurs. I have used
1:3 with 120, but not with 35mm. I generally use it with sheet film in Jobo
Expert Drums, 1:1, 50ml total per sheet. I prefer it at 1:1, though full
strength it is also an excellent performing developer.

Adrienne:

Several alternatives to animal gelatin have been tried to date, with less-than-satisfactory results.  Animal gelatin appears to have a number of serendipitous properties for photography which are not readily reproducible either by other natural substances (animal or vegetable) or by engineered synthetics.  (This doesn't mean people don't keep trying, though -- gelatin's also notoriously "unreliable" in its near-natural state, and extensive washing and purification has to take place first, followed by careful mixing of gelatins from many different sources, and then extensive testing to make sure the batch has the right physical, chemical and electrical properties; from what I've been able to gather, it's as much an arcane art as it is a science, and most of the major manufacturers of film and paper keep their formulations as closely-held secrets.)

Sorry.  If it weren't for animals, photography as we know it simply couldn't be done.  Another gift we receive from the animal kingdom, I guess.  That may change in the future (for example, biotech could conceivably produce "natural" gelatin that was never in the bones/cartilages of sentient living creatures).

For a good discussion of the pros/cons of gelatin and its alternatives, see Jack H. Coote's "Ilford Monochrome Darkroom Practice: A Manual of Black & White Processing & Printing" (Butterworth-Heinemann, 1996).  Great book for overall inspiration, too.  ;-)

Help!  I need your input on this:  you know, when Kodak developed Xtol, they
found out there was a problem with diluting:  that is, you need to have 100
ml (3.5 oz)  Xtol PER ROLL of film in the tank in order to properly develop
the film, and thus, when using a 16 oz tank and doing two rolls of film, a
1:3 dilution (which the other photo faculty in my dept recommend) is
technically impossible, you see?  It would require 200 ml Xtol, and 600 ml
water or 800 ml/28 oz. for a 1:3 dilution and there, of course, is not 28
oz. in the tank. Otherwise, Kodak says, you get underdevelopment.  I called
Kodak on this and they agree with what I say; however, I think I prefer
experienced photographers' opinions on this issue also.
    My question is, does anyone have experience with Xtol, how do you dilute
it, do you find 1:3 in a small tank works fine, if it does result in
underdevelopment how have you compensated in time for that, etc etc??
     I have seen a couple posts on Xtol, one person just lately said they
used full strength Xtol, another at 1:1, which are the two choices I would
tell my students.  Am I correct in this or is 1:3 (against what Kodak says)
OK?
Chris

I said I would get back to the list about the results of my toning
experiment. When dry, the one I exposed with the timer set to 2.6 (hit 8
times) was the best.  But I thought there wasn't enough change in the image
color to make it worth the trouble, at 20:1.  So like Curt, I am going to
do it at a stronger dilution next time, 10:1. Also, this time I am going to
mix up my own orbit bath, because when I used the batch supplied in our
darkroom, it didn't get all the fix out, and there was mottling on some of
the prints.  The Basic Techniques of Photography book claims you can tone
after a two minute wash in water, followed by orbit bath.  In other words,
it says you don't have to do a full wash before toning.  This assumes you
are diluting the toner with wash aid also and doing a wash aid bath after
toning also.  I am going to see if this works, if you use fresh orbit bath.
It didn't work with old orbit bath.

Well, the dept would say it is for economy.  The other teachers use the
greater dilution because they say any less produces contrasty bullet proof
negatives, e.g. 1:1 so they would say effect I suppose.  To me, I would
recommend what Kodak says, either full or 1:1, but if contrast is truly too
great.....

Shannon I don't wash at all before toning...
My standard procedure for printing:
I  process my prints with a two bath fix-
the first is the Zone VI version with less hardener than Kodak's 
I hold all the prints in a water bath
until the printing session is done
then move to the second fix  (second bath is pure hypo no hardener) 
then directly into the selenium toner   ( which I mix by adding 6 ounces 
of KRST to a gallon of working hypo clear (usually Rapid Wash or Orbit)
no staining, beautiful ,easy to control toning in 3 to 10 minutes
I then go into a fresh Hypo clearing bath
rinse
then wash in an archival washer for 90 minutes.

as a side note I always understood that the mixing of toner in hypo clear 
was simply for pH reasons (ie convenient) and  had nothing to do with 
hypo clearing and that simply mixing toner into a sodium sulphite? ate? 
solution would also work as well.

Hi,

I have found it pretty hard to get "too contrasty" with Xtol - I
occasionally screw up and shoot TMY as TMX - two stops over exposure - and
then process incorrectly to boot. Xtol has a unique quality which makes over
exposed images flatter generally...the highlights suffer, but you can print
them if you boost the contrast.

As far as contrast is concerned you only need vary time or temp to get
anything from soft {N-1} to very contrasty results {n+2}. Anyone getting
Bullet proof highlights should "reload" on technique! :o)
 Absolutely follow the minimum amount suggested for this developer. It is a
very good addition to the developers that are known as "classics" and gives
excellent results when properly used.
 A note on economy......You will spend far more trying to rescue improperly
developed negs than the price of any developer. One sheet of 8x10 paper used
to zero in on the improperly timed , diluted, etc. negatives makes up for
the price of the whole roll. Developer is probably the worst place to try
for a few cents saving.

Adrienne,  There are several silver processes that you coat yourself, much like
Noble printing (platinum/palladium).  There is also a gold process, the
Chrysotype, that Mike Ware has created.  It is also similar to the other Ferric
Oxalate and Ammonium Ferric Oxalate processes.  This will get you away from
animal gelatin , except if you by a gelatin sized paper.

The Maco toner that I spoke of is distributed by the same folks that are selling
Cachet paper.  1-888-322-2438 or find them at

http://www.onecachet.com/

There paper has been a welcome relief to the dull papers that I have used.  Talk
to Ike or Gary

  Kodak Brown Toner is essentially the same as Kodak T-8, except its very
concentrated. 

Kodak Polysulfide Toner T-8

Water						750.0 ml
Polysulfide (Liver of Sulphur)	  7.5 grams
Sodium Carbonate, anhydrous		  2.0 grams
Water to make 				  1.0 liter

The MSDS for Brown Toner indicates is has a small amount of Sodium
Hydroxide in it as well as the above. 
  The instructions for using T-8 are to use it full-strength. Kodak Brown
Toner is a highly concentrated stock solution. Toning time is reduced to
about a third by raising the temperature of the toning bath to 100F. 
  I will post the formula for the IPI SilverLock toner a bit later.

Is there a way to effectively talk about water types?  (Sixty minutes or 60
degrees F are standards we all can effectively communicate with, but your
water vs. mine could be worlds apart.)
Hard, soft, sulfur, iron, organic etc all are W A T E R, but non of us are
talking about the same thing -really.
pH metering or the Munsell notation system enable one to communicate
effectively but how can we communicate about local, regional water?
Distilled would seem to be the only thing that could be actually in common.

    Dilute the Xtol 1:3, fill a container with the solution. I use the
measuring pitcher or a JOBO tank with an extra extension piece added if
needed, and develop the film by agitating by hand in the dark for the
required time. It is peaceful and will also allow you to pull rolls with
differing developing times when their time is up. Just put the rolls to go
into the stop or water rinse on the top of the stack of reels & when their
time is up, put them into the next bath.

Give Dick Sullivan a call at Bostick & Sullivan in New Mexico and purchase
his inexpensive Ziatype kit. It works very well with watercolor papers that
he also sells. Beautiful images and tonal variations to warm the heart of
most anyone.

  Primarily Brown Toner. The reason is that it does not split tone. If full
toning is acceptable (a distinct color change) then Selenium toner will
provide full image protection and any sulfiding toner will provide full
image protection.
  Iron and Copper toners were tested many years ago by Lee, Wood, and Drago
who found the resulting images _less_ stable than untoned silver. 
  I am re-reading my copy of the IPI report and awaiting a reply from Doug
Nishimura, who is on vacation, to some questions I sent him.  I will then
summarize what I have learned and post it here. 
  I asked BTW about Nelson's Gold toner. This is a sulfiding toner with
gold as a modifying agent. It does not split tone so may be a good toner
for protection. 
  The IPI report shows that Gold toners, like Kodak GP-2, are quite
effective. However, enough silver must be converted plus, GP-2 is both
expensive and somewhat toxic. 
 Again, for image protection, the key is how much of the silver is
converted to something more stable. Gold, silver sulfide, silver selenide,
are all very stable. The issue is whether a particular type of toner
converts enough of the image silver in all parts of the image. 
  BTW, Mike Gudzinowitz posted a method of using KRST in a solution of
Kodalk, which is quite effective. I will do a Deja search and try to find it. 
  KRST likes prints to be neutral or somewhat alkaline. It can deposit a
film of elemental Selenium on prints which are acid. The main reason for
using a wash aid bath before toning, or diluting the toner in it is to
adjust the pH. 
  The concentration of wash aid in combined toner is probably not enough to
function as a washing accelerator. Plus, the sulfite, which is the main
active ingredient in wash aid, slowly turns to sulfate as it oxidizes. The
sulfate does no harm but is not as effective as a wash aid. The idea of
alkalizing the KRST wiht carbonate or Kodalk is a good one since these
substances do not oxidize rapidly and can be used in KRST solutions much
stronger than the 1:20 which is the maximum recommended by Kodak. Kodalk or
carbonate also tend to undo the hardener which can improve toning with
selenium. 
  BTW, a problem with Brown Toner, or T-8 is that it is very alkaline and
softens the emulsion. They are also often used hot, so treat prints and
films gently. The IPI formula has a lower pH partly to avoid excessive
emulsion swelling.

  I once mentioned in a post, as sort of an aside, that photographic
emulsions were made of gelatin, and hoped there were no vegans reading it. 
  Well, it turns out this is a genuine concern for those who are vegetarian
for ethical reasons (as opposed to those who avoid animal products for
strictly health reasons). 
  Unfortunately, the industry has never found anything to replace gelatin.
It has a very complex interaction with the substances added to it to make a
photographic emulsion. While printing can be done on paper with a nitro
celulose carrier (similar to wet plate) such paper is difficult to work
with. Albumin paper was widely used before gelatin emulsions were devised
but albumin is derived from eggs so may be just as objectionable to
vegetarians. 
  There is simply no substitute for gelatin in film. All of the major film
manufacturers have been searching for a gelatin replacement for decades.
While some plastics have shown promise, none have turned out to be practical. 
  Some learning about the way food animals are raised, kept, treated, and
slaughtered will keep anyone from ridiculing those who decide not to be a
part of the process, if it doesn't turn you into a vegetarian yourself.

Thanx, Chuck--I figured this should be true, that contrast certainly should
be able to be controlled by development time or temp; the only thing I can
figure is that, since this is a beginning photography class, the other
teachers are not able to give the students an easily understood correct N-1
dev. time or something.  I suppose I could be the one that does all the
testing for the sections of beginning photography, but heck, they have far
more experience teaching than I do and I figured, being the new kid on the
block as far as teaching is concerned at this university, that the other
teachers would know what up wit dat...and frankly, it is very uncomfortable
for me to enter a teaching scene new and already be questioning protocol.
However, I feel that correct procedure is necessary to teach students how to
become fine printers.  I have high hopes....

Just buy them directly from Stouffer's they are  less expensive purchased
directly. And they take plastic.

Last year I contacted a friend that does water research and was told that
until recently most water { non processed } was very low in dissolved
minerals and should be "overwhelmed" by the developers ingredients . This
would alleviate any need for distilled water unless rare circumstances
occurred. Recent rain in the 3.4PH range may be changing this as far as
surface water that is used unbuffered. Most treatment plants buffer the
water enough not to worry.This is recently changing as rain water is acidic
enough to cause some water systems that rely on surface water to contain
enough acid to affect certain developers that need more buffering than is
available in the developers own chemistry. This is rare thankfully. There
are other dissolved minerals that might cause some trouble but in most cases
no problems occur. All the same the small price of distilled water would
insure very constant results and be closer to everyone else's results if all
used it. I have tried to standardize my developers by using distilled water
and seem to have excellent results. The last step in processing whether you
use a photoflow type solution or not should be distilled water. As the
Distilled water replaces the wash water it allows the easy removal of
impurities and is said by many to aid in preventing streaking. This type
info is always subject to someone giving glowing reports about using their
local water and never having trouble but I suspect that there are just as
many cases where distilled water may give superior consistency.

  I simply used a bigger tank...but in my experience there's no worthwhile
difference between Xtol 1:2 and 1:3 at least with the several films I used.

  I think a valid interpretation would be that the other teachers haven't
the foggiest how to control contrast via development time or temperature
changes. Sad, but not surprising.

  If you're going to use Xtol, I'd strongly recommend that the students use
a 1:1 dilution; there won't be the speed loss sometimes seen with straight
Xtol while, more important, there's less chance of failure because of not
using enough stock.

Barry Thornton's notes on his website are the best general info for film
problems I have ever seen....he says that almost all of the beginners
problems are due to underexposed and overdeveloped negatives.....true, true
, true!
I hope that Barry doesn't mind me speaking for him!  :o)
I taught for a while and would agree 100%. Most folks are trying for fast
films and even faster fixes to the problems that this produces. I can almost
bet that one stop more exposure and 20% less development will produce better
negs for anyone who hasn't taken the time to "zero in" on the best exposure
index and developing time/temp combos.
The best way to beat the new teacher on the block syndrome is to just
produce better results than the rest! :o)

Although it is true that most alternative processes do not use gelatine,
most require high qualtiy (water colour) papers to coat on, these papers
must be sized, else the emulsions "sinks" into the paper, most papers
are sized with gelatine AFAIK.....

Why don't you try out different dilutions yourself to see if YOU can find
any difference in the resulting PRINTS (not the negatives). Shoot  ten
pictures on the film, make two blanks and then repeat twice and cut the
film in three parts and develop each in a different dilution. Or make
fifteen shots, five blanks and fifteen shots and try two dilutions. Your
opinion counts!

I have tried stock solution, 1+1 and 1+3 and settled for 1+1, mainly for
convenience: it is easy to mix  to the correct temperature and there will
be enough stock solution for each film when using the tanks I have. BTW the
development times times given by Kodak are very realistic. Remember what
they say about agitation: gentle. (For Tmax developer they say vigorous,or
words to that effect.)

Darkroom Innovations (now The View Camera Store - why did he change such a
distinctive and well known name to such a generic name?) periodically
publishes a newsletter. About two to three years ago there was one devoted
to Fred Newman's tests of optimum selenium toning dilutions and times with
various paper brands. As I recall, by "optimum" he meant highest D Max.
Interestingly, he found that leaving the paper in the toner for too long a
period of time would actually decrease D Max. In any event, you might want
to contact Fred and see if he could send you a copy of that issue. Might
save a lot of paper, selenium, and testing time.

I don't think this should or will cause ridicule - just respect for your
stance.
I understand that the gelatine's qualities are a very significant factor in
the performance of a film or paper's emulsion. It is not simply a 'carrier'
for the emulsion (or, more correctly, suspension), it reacts, I believe,
with the emulsion to be a factor in its light sensitivity and
'developability'. Since it is an animal product, getting consistent
characteristics in the substance is a headache for quality control. I
believe that all sorts of substitutes have been attempted, but none
apparently successfully.

As an avowed b&w and darkroom ADDICT, as well as a committed vegetarian, I
would like to pose a question to all list members (several of whom are quite
"chemically sophisticated"), which I haven't yet seen addressed.

Short of "going digital" (unthinkable for a long list of reasons), are any
of you aware of non-animal (gelatin) versions of B&W film or paper
emulsions?  Or am I so in the dark(room) I don't even realize animal
by-products aren't even used anymore?

This question is really plaguing me; Richard Knoppow's recent post
concerning the "sizing" of both fiber & RC paper bases adds yet another step
in the process in which animals are used for photographic purposes.

I realize I may be opening myself up to ridicule by some members, but it is
a risk I am willing to assume.  Any assistance/advice would be appreciated.

Regards,

Adrienne

Help!  I need your input on this:  you know, when Kodak developed Xtol, they
found out there was a problem with diluting:  that is, you need to have 100
ml (3.5 oz)  Xtol PER ROLL of film in the tank in order to properly develop
the film, and thus, when using a 16 oz tank and doing two rolls of film, a
1:3 dilution (which the other photo faculty in my dept recommend) is
technically impossible, you see?  It would require 200 ml Xtol, and 600 ml
water or 800 ml/28 oz. for a 1:3 dilution and there, of course, is not 28
oz. in the tank. Otherwise, Kodak says, you get underdevelopment.  I called
Kodak on this and they agree with what I say; however, I think I prefer
experienced photographers' opinions on this issue also.
    My question is, does anyone have experience with Xtol, how do you dilute
it, do you find 1:3 in a small tank works fine, if it does result in
underdevelopment how have you compensated in time for that, etc etc??
     I have seen a couple posts on Xtol, one person just lately said they
used full strength Xtol, another at 1:1, which are the two choices I would
tell my students.  Am I correct in this or is 1:3 (against what Kodak says)
OK?
Chris

Christina
Just a thought - would 1:2 work? I use that dilution very successfully with
Perceptol and HP5 Plus. I had to work out correct times by splitting the
published 1:1 and 1:3 times as a start for my own trials, but Xtol 1:2 times
are published. I find these published times on the high side with a tendency
to produce hard highlights.

testing for the sections of beginning photography, but heck, they have far
more experience teaching than I do and I figured, being the new kid on the

It is still a sound practice to use dilute developer, especially for
beginners, but actually for any people using 35mm or roll film where there
is likely to be a variety of subject brightness ranges on the same film. The
compensation properties of the diluted developer help restrain the
highlights a little more to make burning in a little easier. Also, 'one
shot' use gives greater consistency than undiluted replenished developer.
Sharpness should be a little better too, but I am not sure on this latter
point with Xtol. I stopped using it when I found its acutance via edge
effects less satisfactory then some other developers.

So, why is it that there are no fix stains, if you are going directly from
the fix to the toner?
Do the stains come from something other than pure hypo, like the hardener?
It was my understanding that our fix at U of H is a non-hardening fix too.

Although the Seattle water utilities people agree with this (when I asked
them), there is another point of contamination to consider: the pipes in
your house.  The water main to our house is iron, and is dissolving as such
things do.  Given the brownish cast to the water first thing in the morning
I suspected it probably contained detectable amounts of iron the rest of the
time as well.

In fact, my testing has borne this out -- when I read that iron in the water
could reduce the action of developer, I started mixing my Xtol stock and
working solution with distilled water, and gained nearly a stop of speed (in
actual densitometer testing).

Obviously this may not be the case for everyone -- and once I plumb my
darkroom and put in water filters, I'll be testing again to see if I can
stop buying distilled water by the truckload... :-)

This is the other point at which I use distilled water.  I don't use
photo-flo; I just fill the tank with distilled water, agitate, and hang the
negs up.  Works like a charm, and it's one less chemical to dump down the
drain.

The idea is that the prints are evenly covered with fixer or completely 
washed.
 Staining occurs from uneven fixing (either exhausted fixer, or lack of 
agitation in the fixing bath) or from not completely washing the fix out 
of the print (uneven washing) which is what happens if you follow the 
directions on most wash aids- I find that the washing instructions are 
wishful thinking at best.
A minimum of 45 minutes (and I find 90 minutes more appropriate) in an 
upright archival washer.
Hardening agents contribute to staining problems because they impede the 
fixer from washing out of the paper.

But instead of washing the print twice, hold your prints in water between 
fixing baths and go directly from the second fix bath into the toner.

Barry,
     Technically, no, in a 16 oz. tank, according to Kodak, IF you are
developing 2 rolls of film.  Two rolls would require 200 ml (7 oz) developer
itself, and then the water up to 16 oz capacity could only be 9 oz, you see?
So the dilution would be not much above 1:1.  If you were processing only
one roll in a double reel 16 oz. tank, then you could do the 100 ml
developer (prerequisite) and since that is only 3.5 oz you have easily the
1:3 dilution at 3.5 oz/100 ml to 10.5 oz/300ml.  That would make 14 oz of
fluid total.  But usually if you only have one roll to develop you probably
use a one reel tank, no?  I know this all seems really picky, but when
translating into a lab that has 500 people going through it every week
developing film, it means a lot more developer to purchase, at the very
least.  However, my main point is to TEACH what is right, and it seems from
all the replies I am getting about Xtol is the consensus is to use it at
lower dilutions, either full strength or 1:1.  I'm sure that the 'hard
highlights' you mention is exactly what the other teachers are trying to
compensate for, especially in the beginning photography classes.
Chris

John, Chuck,

When I republished in C&D (the lengthy article was originally for the
American "Camera & Darkroom") the results of nine months of enlarger lens
testing by Ctein and Ken Werner, they found that the "optimum" working
apertures were, to most darkroom practitioners, rather wide... usually the
optimum apertures were around one and a half stops down. In the case of the
150mm f/5.6 Rodagon (non-Apo) the optimum working aperture was f/8 with a
minimum aperture of f/11 before degradation. The corner fall-off for that
lens was in the order of 1/4 of a stop and distortion was nil.

BTW: Ctein also claimed, and argued successfully in the US photo press, that
the *only* true "Apo" enlarging lens was the 105mm f/5.6 Apo-El-Nikkor which
was made for scientific use, covered only 35mm (unless stopped down to f/8
for 6x7cm) and cost many thousands of dollars about 20 years ago!

For those interested in Xtol , Kodak has published one of the best
time/temp/film charts for Xtol I have ever seen. They mailed me a copy that
has small tank, Deep tank, Roller processor times and temps at varying
dilutions. I believe all the info is also on their website.
 You can use the different E.I.'s as a good guide for plus and minus
developing. you only need to use the normal E.I. as normal developing times
and use the change in E.I. to have a great guide for + & -. { EX. = Tmax400
at 400 E.I. as normal and E.I. 200 as -1 or 800 as +1 } You will get very
close to what I spent a long time working out for myself. If you find the
normal time different than yours then the % different would be a good
starting guide for all of the differences at each n+ or n- time. They
include many films in this chart and info.....not only their own.
You will find a great savings in going to the 50 liter size for school
purposes and after mixing use the plastic folding water bags { similar to
chemtainers that Kodak already uses } for storage as the bags collapse when
developer is removed alleviating any extra air in the developer.....a real
plus with Xtol.
The use of minimum amounts of stock developer is _I repeat myself here_ is
absolutely necessary with Xtol!!!!!
 With a Jobo processor I never use less than 1 to 1 ratios as you can
quickly pass below the min required!

Hello,

I've belonged to this list for a few months and have learned quite a bit by
reading everyone's postings.  Thanks to all for sharing with a novice.

If any one out there could help me with my problem I'll be forever grateful.
I just bought a used  Archival Rain vertical flow print washer (11x14) and
there was no paperwork to go with it.  Does anyone know if this brand is
still manufactured, and if so, how to contact them?  If they're not around
anymore, which is what I've been lead to believe, is there anyone on this
list that owns one and would be willing to answer a question or two about
it's operation?
I'll appreciate any help I'm given!  Thanks in advance.

Tori

Thanks! This sounds very close to the practices that are done for mapping
and surveillance photos and in that case should produce great images { well
at least as good as the lens can produce. }  . Very good case for exact
enlarger alignment!! I have a 1500 watt lighthead that I need for large
prints but never use the lenses stopped down to give longer exposures for
small prints .  A rheostat is used instead or neutral density for color
where the color temp is far more important. { without this an 11x14 is two
seconds at f/8 } I fear that the use of Dicro and Coldlight heads that are
very bright with small prints causes too many to stop down too much for good
resolution. With the Dicro heads neutral density can be dialed in and with
cold light heads a neutral density filter can be used.
  Just curious....were any Wild lenses tested? { Ziess, I believe, has them
now } They are a "bit" more expensive than regular lenses but are widely
used for exacting purposes.

I have been following this thread with some interest.  Thank you *very* much
for your generous, almost heroic, posting of sound, articulate fact and
informed opinion!

As to your above comment about Nelson's Gold toner: I'd simply like to make
you aware, for what it's worth, that I've used Nelson's to split-tone
gelatin silver for some time now...(yes! - all by itself).

  Unless the school has already purchased a large quantity of Xtol...why
not just use D-76/ID-11 or the easy-to-brew D-23 or D-76H developers. All
you need is metol, sodium sulfite, borax and water, and since the
ingredients can be easily purchased in bulk it would be lots less expensive
than Xtol.

I don't know about Christina's beginning photography studens but so far with
mine just getting across basic concepts is hard enough. I explain that the
manufacturers' times are places to start rather than times etched in stone
and that more exposure than the meter indicates (or a lower film speed)
coupled with less time may give them better photographs but I wouldn't do
any zone system tests for them, nor would I expect beginning students to
understand the testing involved in arriving at their own N -1 developing
times or even what N-1 development is supposed to accomplish.  Perhaps this
has been the experience of her colleagues who have been around longer. Why
not ask them?  Brian

  I wonder how they tested.
  Geometrical distortion is not affected by the stop in any lens.
Symmetrical lenses are free of geometical distortion at 1:1 and reasonably
free from it at other magnifications. Most modern enlarging lenses are
Plasmat types, which are slightly un-symmetrical to improve correction at
the magnification at which they will be used mostly. 
  There are lenses on the market with "Apo" in the name which are not
apochromatic lenses. In particular, Rodenstock seems to use the term very
loosely. 
  I had this out with Bob Salomon about a year ago. His answer was some
drivel that Rodenstock followed ISO-9000 recomendations. They have nothing
whatever to do with the issue. 
  Rodenstock publishes lens curves, they show clearly that these so-called
"apo" lenses are achromats, not apochromats, very misleading.
  There is no formally established definition for apochromatic for camera
and enlarging lenses, as there is for microscope and telescope objectives.
However the defilition applied to the latter has been used for generations. 
  An apochromatic lens is one which has been corrected to bring light of
three wavelengths to a common focus. It is corrected for spherical
aberration for two colors. 
  An achromat is correced to bring two colors to a common focus and is
corrected for spherical for one color. 
  It is true that a well designed achromat may have less secondary spectrum
than a poorly designed apochromat but that still doesn't make it an
apochromat.
  A really well designed lens will be well corrected for lateral chromatic
as well as longitudinal chromatic. The longitudinal correction brings the
light to a common focus, the lateral correction is for magnification, so
that the images for different colors are the same size. 
  Apochromatic correction is gotten by the proper choice of glass types for
the lens. 
  Symmetrical lenses are automatically corrected for lateral color when the
entire imaging system is symmetrical (that is at 1:1 magnification) but
most have very good lateral correction at infinity. Designing
non-symmetrical lenses (i.e. Tessars) to be free of lateral is difficult,
but many excellently corrected non-symmetrical lense have been designed.
The Kodak Ektar series was intended for color use and are exceptionally
well corrected this way.
  The "optimum" stop for any lens depends partly on the field to be
covered. A lens may even be diffraction limited when wide open at the
center of the image but that is not the optimum stop away from the center. 
  The maximum stop at any angle is generally that at whcih the entire iris
is seen from that angle, i.e. there is no mechanical vignetting from the
lens mounting. For a camera lens with focal length approximately equal to
the diagonal of the format, this will be two stops down, or where the
diaphragm is about half its maximum diameter. 
  For other stop-dependant aberrations, like coma and spherical, the
optimum depends on how well corrected the lens is at the image angle
chosen. Again, it will ususally be two to three stops down from maximum
opening. 
  Since the coverage angle needed is less when the distance is less than
infinity, the image size for a given focal length varies with
magnification. It is twice linear dimension for 1:1, i.e., a lens which
covers 4x5 at infinity will cover 8x10 at 1:1. 
  The stop, as an f/stop, will, of course, be magnified along with the
image, so the "effective" size of the stop at 1:1 is half that at infinity
focus. That is, a lens which is set to f/8 and set up for a 1:1 image is
will be effectively at f/16 both for light level and for diffraction
limiting. 
  This is probably not a serious factor in small format enlarging, where
the magnification is fairly high, but is certainly a very important factor
for large format or when making macro or micro images. 
  The performance of the lens as far as "optimum stop" should take this
into consideration. 
  I am very skeptical of Ctein's work although he has been proven right in
several cases.
  This started out to be a short note:-)
  We are having Miami type weather here today.

  Very interesting. One of the virtures touted in the patent is that it
tones evenly when partial toning is done. Doesn't make it so. 
  I presume you find it tones the dense areas before the highlights. This
is what most toners do when split toning. 
 BTW, Nelson's was published by both Kodak and Ansco. The language of the
instructions for both is lifted right out of the patent.

  Kodak Rapid Selenium Toner contains a lot of ammonium thiosulfate. The
MSDS shows it to be about 20% of the concentrated solution. The toner is
not particularly sensitive to carried over hypo. It is sensitive to acid.
Acid can cause a stain from elemental selenium being precipitated on the
paper. 
  Selenium toner tones silver halide as well as metallic silver. In fact, a
1:9 solution of KRST is suggested by Kodak as an alternative to a 10%
sodium sulfide solution for testing for complete fixing. The degree of
fixing is _very_ important as suggested above. 
  Treating prints with wash aid, or in a bath of 2% sodium carbonate, or 2%
Kodalk, will neutralize the acid from the fixing bath. Prints should be at
least rinsed after such treatment. Because of the hypo in KRST prints toned
in it should be treated with wash aid, just as though they had just been
fixed, and washed fully. 
  The fixing caviat is true for most toners. They will tone remaining halide. 
  When a toner which uses a ferricyanide bleach is used very thorough
washing is desirable. The ferricyanide can combine with any hypo residue
forming Farmer's reducer. Two bath Sepia toner is the most common of this
type.

  I didn't have this at hand the other day when I posted the formula for
Kodak T-8
  Since I must wait to get some additional answers and to have Dr.
Nishimura scan over my articla before posting it, I thought I would not not
wait to post this. Its very simple.
  The concentrated solution of liver of sulfur is important. One of the
issues discussed in the IPI paper is the fact that liver of sulfur is not a
very well defined substance. It is pointed out that there is a dynamic
equilibrium of the various anions in solution. The concentration of high
rank polysulfides in a concentrated solution is higher than in a low
concentration solution.  High concentrations have less odor and longer
life. I will not be more detailed here.

The IPI toner is as follows:

To make one liter of toner concentrate

Dissolve 495 grams of solid sulfurated potash in one liter of de-ionized
water.
  Be careful not to beat air into this solution.
  When dissolved add  Borax, 20 grams/ liter.
  Thats it!
  For use dilute not more than 1:25
  Signs of decomposition are formation of scum and strong "rotten egg"
odor. Discard any toner which has started to decompose. 
  Prints or film to be toned should be thoroughly fixed and washed and
treated with a wash aid to help remove the hypo and to neutralize any acid
from the fixing bath. Like Selenium toner, this stuff likes prints or films
to be neutral or slightly alkaline. Acid tends to decompose the toner so
this step is very important. 
 After toning treat in a solution of wash aid and wash _rapidly_ at least
at first. This toner, like Brown Toner, continues to tone as it washes out.
Unlike most other toners, polysulfide toners _accelerate_ when diluted, so
very rapid washing out, at least right after toning, is necessary to
prevent over toning or staining.
  One of the questions I have pending is treatment temperature. I believe
this is intended for use at room temperature rather than the high
temprature recommended for Brown Toner and T-8.
  The test of toning is the use of a dichromate bleach and the use of a
peroxide immersion test. More on this later.
  I've posted this along with the formula for T-8 because of the remider
that Brown Toner is not marketed in many parts of the world. 
  I would be very glad to hear from anyone trying this stuff on printing
paper. It was designed for microfilm. Microfilm emulsion is somewhat
different from either printing paper or pictorial film. This was not tested
on either. It should work OK but there are no recommendations for time. 
  Since the effectiveness of the protection depends on the amount of silver
converted to sulfide longer toning is better than shorter toning. I have no
idea of how much color change this toner causes, it probably varies with
the material.
  I will post the formulas for the bleach and peroxide tests later. Its too
hot here to type much:-)

Brian,
     This is absolutely right; I plan on going to class and just handing out
a sheet with simple development times on them for them to follow, but am
only going to include the full strength and 1:1 times for xtol as it seems
this list is in agreement about.  My point was, why bother giving them 1:2
and 1:3 times if they can't use either in a tank that contains two rolls of
film?  And also, my point for asking the question was whether anyone on this
list has felt that Xtol at these concentrations was truly too contrasty if
the times and temps that Kodak recommends are followed.

The fixer will be in solution and will not have any "weight" to carry it
down . As long as the wash water has good movement and is being slowly
replaced with fresh water it will work fine.
Lots of hype on this subject.!!

   John, forget about hypo being heavier than water and sinking, 'taint so,
McGee. The hypo diffused into the water in a continuous process, so, even
if the water was perfectly still, the water from around the emulsion would
do no more than drift downwards causing some convection. The convetive
current would result, ultimately, in an even solution of hypo. 
  The fact that the water is flowing completely destroys even this
convective current.
  Fairly vigorous flow at the emulsion surface is desired. This is mostly
because the concentration of hypo is greatest there. 
  Washing of the emulsion is a rate controlled diffusion process. It
depends on the ratio of concentration of hypo in the emulsion vs: the
amount in the water at the emulsion surface. The rate of diffusion is
exponential, so it pays to have the water at the surface as fresh as
possible. 
  Washing out of fiber paper is by diffusion at first, but the hypo tends
to bond to the paper fibers so washing out becomes a friction-related
process. Thats why fiber base paper takes so much longer to wash than other
types of material. The bond can be at least partially broken by the use of
a wash aide. Ilford has a processing technique which is intended to fix the
emulsion so quickly that the hypo does not have a chance to get into the
paper fibers, it works for some papers but not for others. 
  The easiest way to set up a print or film washer is to admit the water
from near the bottom and let it come out the top, there is less restriction
of flow rate that way. 
  The idea is to get as quick a change of water at the surfaces, and of
course, to prevent the surfaces from toughing each other. The flow at the
surfaces can be a very thin layer and still wash effectively; washing is
not determined by the amount of water but rather the rate of change of the
thin layer in contact with the film or paper. The idea is to move the water
away from the surface rapidly. 
 So, its possible to make a washer that is effective but doesn't use a lot
of water.
  For roll film just sticking a hose into the center of the reel works very
well. Sheet film is harder, but a tank simiilar to a small print washer
works. If the films are in developing holders no separators are needed.
  There are lots of print washer designs. I have an old Zone VI 16x20
washer. Its fill time is too long to be a really efficient print washer
although its better than dumping the prints into a tray. The spaces for
each print could be a lot smaller, which would result in a much more rapid
change of water at the print, and a reduction of the amount of water used. 
  Again, the idea of "heavy" hypo is very misleading. If you measure the SG
of a hypo solution you will find it heavier than water. If you put some dye
in it to trace it and add it to a tank of water, you will find that it does
not sink to the bottom but will slowly disperse until the entire tank is a
more dilute solution of hypo. 
 Heavy hypo is usually considered a Fred Pickerism, but I've seen the same
thing in some very old photography handbooks. He probably thought it was
estblished fact and never thought it through.

I have been throwing around an idea in my head about building my own print and
negative washers.  I look at the commercially available units and a design
question comes to mind.  I notice that most of the units that I have seen whether
or not they force the water in from the bottom or  in from the top.  The waste
water then bubbles up through the negatives and exits the top of the washer.  To
me this seems to be inefficient.  .  It would seem that that easiest way to
remove the waste water, would be to let it flow out following the path of
gravity, because it is loaded with fixer.   Am I missing some obvious fact.

Thanks

One good reason for schools to use Xtol is to avoid the problems of Metol
allergies. It doesn't hit too many but when it does you have a kid and
parents really worried. Especially when they don't associate the skin rashes
and sores with the small amount of darkroom work done in most schools.

Xtol has no metol, a big advantage with school or gang darkrooms.

John
I can see the need for a print washer, but I have always been very sceptical
about washing negatives in some kind of forced water flow, often at the
prevailing mains water temperature, which in this country is almost always
too low for wash efficiency and varies greatly from processing solution
temperature. Also, unless the water is properly filtered, we are bombarding
the swollen gelatine emulsion with water-born impurities and solids.
It is pretty easy to wash film which has not been hardened using the Ilford
recommended method (see Ilford Manual of Photography), or derivations of it,
which mean constant agitation in three or four complete changes of water at
20C in a tank - no hypo clear needed. It is so quick and simple as not to
be a problem, unlike print washing of course.
Using a bulk supply of water at the correct temperature, my own technique
with spiral tanks is to remove the lid, then after a quick initial water
fill and pour out to dispose of droplets of rapid fixer remaining on film
and tank walls, I fill the tank with water, then plunge the central post
holding the film spirals up and down vigorously. After 30 seconds I pour out
the water and refill the tank. I repeat this not less than 6 times, followed
by a rinse aid soak of not less than 30 seconds, then hang to dry.
It is a VERY effective wash, but is time and water economical.
If your thoughts are for a sheet film washer obviously my spiral tank method
is difficult to apply.

"For roll film just sticking a hose into the center of the reel works very
well."

Richard - depends on water temperature surely? And presumably, you would
want the water to be filtered to avoid nasties being projected at the
delicate wet film surface? In areas of the UK where water is metered, this
method would be expensively wasteful of water I believe. Still, the problem

One good reason for schools to use Xtol is to avoid the problems of Metol
allergies. It doesn't hit too many but when it does you have a kid and
parents really worried. Especially when they don't associate the skin rashes
and sores with the small amount of darkroom work done in most schools.

Xtol has no metol, a big advantage with school or gang darkrooms.

Nor does Rodinal, which is very economical, simple to mix and store, and is
used by some of the places at which I teach for the same reasons you quote
for Xtol. But maybe you guys over in the U.S. only want to use Kodak
materials?

Greetings-

> Where's the best place to buy some with instructions?
> S. Shapiro

I've always used The Formulary's Nelson's Gold available in various sized
"kits" - although I now buy it sans the gold chloride, as I purchase that in
quantity and it makes the kit much more economical.

As to instructions - well, they come with the kit. Unless you mean
instructions for split-toning - which are a little more involved.

But, briefly: It's a process I stumbled upon and do not exactly know the
why's and wherefore's - but Nelson's starts to split at higher than
recommended temps - approx 120 vs. the recommended 100-110 - on certain
papers as it nears [or surpasses?] exhaustion.  I use it without
replenishment until I see the split start to happen on test prints - I then
run batches of 3-4 prints through the toner and only replenish with tiny
amounts of gold in order to "hold" the splits.  It's very capricious and
inexact - but it splits beautifully with iridescent reds in the shadows and
cold hard blues in the highlights - with a warm, almost sepia glow
throughout.

Hope this helps-

Jon

For those who are interested bellow the Nelson formula (from the 
Glafkides'book) It is not so easy to prepare.
    Heat to boiling 450g of sodium thiosulphate and 56g of potassium alum in
4l of water. Let go back to room temperature and add 56g of sodium
triphosphate and add the mixture (prepared before) of 8g of potassium
bromide dissolved in 30ml of water and 4g of silver nitrate ( this give a
suspension). Finally add just before toning 7.5 ml of a 6.5% solution of
gold chloride. Toning temperature is 32-45C (100 to 125 F).After toning
wash and fix for 5mn.
    The Kodak formula is different if some one is interested in I can also
send it.

    Daniel

Interesting. What's the main product line in paper Dan? Over here Ilford is
THE standard. Everybody has Multigrade as the primary product. We hardly
ever see Kodak's yellow boxes/packets now. I would guess that Agfa is second
most popular. In films, it is nowhere near as clear cut with a good
selection of all makers' emulsions and no dominant brand.

..........Snipped..............
 Just as an added thought............I live in the Southeast USA and just
tried a couple of phone calls to the surrounding states to photo stores and
could not find a single pack of Agfa paper. Ilford and Kodak ran neck and
neck. I actually could not find any Agfa products except the occasional
bottle of Rodinal.
 Since subscribing to this group I've enjoyed the comments about what
products are being used "across the pond." I just wish our cameras could use
10 x8 film!  Some of the claims about your results sure sound better than
what I get with the 8x10 !    :o)
 Alas, Barry, as you say things are bigger over here and I think that the
dust spots lead in that area. Maybe if I went metric I could have smaller
spotting chores.

  This doesn't sound like Nelson's toner, but rather, a hypo-alum type
toner, perhaps with gold chloride in it. 
  Nelson's was patented by Walter C. Nelson and assigned to Eastman Kodak.
The patent number is: 1,849245, March 15, 1932. Curiously enough Agfa/Ansco
also published the formula, so Kodak must have licensed them. I wonder what
Kodak got in return.
  The Kodak formula is T-21, the Agfa/Ansco Agfa 223. The language of both
comes straight from the patent. 
  Here are the instructions from the patent but with amounts in Metric
rather than English measure:

Nelson's Gold Toner
First prepare the following solution:
Solution No.1
Water, at 130F				4.0 liters
Sodium thiosulfate (crystaline)   960.0 grams
Ammonium Persulfate		    120.0 grams

  The hpoo is dissolved before adding the ammonium persulfate.
The bath is stirred vigorouslywhile adding the ammonium persulfate. I fthe
bath does not turn milky, the temperature is increased until it does.

  Next, prepare the following solution:
Solution No.2
Water						64.0 ml
Silver Nitrate, crystals		 5.2 grams
Sodium Chloride				 5.2 grams

  The silver nitrate must be dissolved completely before adding the sodium
chloride and immediately afterwared the solution, including the milky white
precipitate procuded, is added to the first solution (solution No.1) which
should not be warmer than 100F.

  Next prepare solution No.3

Solution No.3
Water						250.0 ml
Gold chloride				  1.0 gram
 
  To use the toner add 125ml of Solution No.3 to the previously mixed
Solution No.1 and No.2. while stirring rapidly. The temperature of the
solutions should not be over 100F.

  The completed toning bath is allowed to stand until it has become cool
and a sediment has formed. The clear solution shuld be decanted for use. 
  The toner should be heated to between 100F and 110F. Toning will take
about 15 minutes, depending on the kind of paper. 
  After toning the print should be rinsed in cold water and   returned to
the fixing bath for five minutes, after which they are washed in the usual
way. 
  The above bath will tone about 50 8x10 prints after which 4.0 ml of
solution No.3 should be added per each 50 prints. 

  A couple of notes:
  The hypo type is not specified in the patent but is almost certainly
crystaline since that was the most common form at the time. Crystaline hypo
is quite endothermic. While the mixing procedure evidently is supposed to
cause some decomposition of the hypo it may be that if anhydrous hypo is
used that a lower temperature should also be used. Use 64% of the amount of
hypo where anhydrous is used instead of crystaline.
  The sodium chloride for solution No.2 should be pure salt, not table
salt. Table salt ususally has some potassium iodide in it and often
fillers. Kosher salt is ususally chemically pure. 

  Supposedly, Nelson's doesn't split tone when prints are partially toned. 

  The main advantage of Nelson's over a hypo-alum bath is the color and the
lack of split toning. The color is somewhat different than other "sepia"
toners because of the effect of the Gold, which shifts the color toward red
and away from purple.

    Richard,

    The formula you gave is the Kodak formula also given in the Glafkides.
If the first formula is better for split toning maybe Jonathan(Bailey) would
be more interested in it for the split toning. I have seen the Jon'split
toning and they are really beautiful.
I believe the Hypo in the formula is hydrated form (10 moles of water).

    Daniel

  Formulae snipped...

   I've seen a formula similar to the one you posted before somewhere,
perhaps in Clerk's manual. This is a modification of the hypo-alum type.
   About the only way to find out what these formulas do it to mix them up
and try them.
   The Gold toner which is used to tone paper a slate blue will turn
sulfide toned images red. If a print has been partially toned in a sepia
toner the gold toner will tone the sulfide part red and the remaining
metallic silver blue. Probably, this same mechanism can happen with
combined toners. 
  I don't know the chemical process of Nelson's toner so can't guess at
what happens if its gotten hot enough. Hypo alum toner is mixed hot enough
to partially decompose the thiosulfate, Nelson's is not. I also don't know
what Nelson's would look like without the gold. 
  As I pointed out, Nelson's was patented and the patent assigned to Kodak.
However, Agfa, and Ansco after them, also published the same formula, as
Nelson's Gold Toner with the patent number (in fact, that is where I got
it). So, at some time in the mid to late 1930's Kodak must have licensed
Agfa/Ansco. My guess is that it might have been part of some
cross-licensing arrangment for something that Kodak wanted. It sure would
be interesting to know the history of this. It would also be interesting to
know something about Nelson.

 Sorry about that. For some reason my mail program sent the original back
to the list along with my reply. Eudora is mostly pretty reliable but does
hichcough sometimes.

There was, I seem to recall, a thread on the alt-process group fairly
recently about the need (or not) to fix prints after gold toning processes.
May I assume from this post that you advocate it?  Instructions with the
toner make no mention of it....

Do you also advocate fixing after the GP-1 gold toner as well?

Briefly, what's happening that fixing might be indicated?

Thanks very much!

Best - Jon

Hello,
This mail has been buzzing around in the back of my
mind, after reading the article in the BJP magazine
about 5x4 and film flatness it got me thinking. In the
article a dial guage is used, this will measure to
1/1000 of an inch or 0.02mm. I have a set of verniers
that will measure almost to the same accuracy. I put a
negative in the glassless carrier for the LPL 7451,
used the edge of a spirit level layed across the
negative carrier to create a datum across the negative
and measured the drop down to the negative. By looking
at the reflection of the caliper in the film this can
be done quite well.
I then repeated this a couple of times for both 35mm
and 2.25" negatives.

For 35mm, centre is +.2mm compared to corner.
For 2.25" centre is +.5mm compared to corner.

I also measured the negative carrier to lens board
alignment. The lens board rises relative to the
negative carrier by 0.64mm over its length of approx
180mm, from column side to front side. Scaling this
for each negative size gives:
For 35mm, 24/180*.64mm => +/- .06mm
For 2.25 neg  56/180 *.64mm => +/- 0.10mm
For 4*5  neg  90/180 *.64mm => +/- 0.18mm

Now to guess that a 4*5 neg is 1mm dip in centre.

Then combine negative flatness and carrier/lens
alignment.

35mm

Column side   centre  Outside
0             +.2     0
+.06          0.00   -0.06
-----------------------------
+0.06         +.20    -0.06
for 35mm  .26mm change

0             +.5      0
+.1           0       -0.1
---------------------------
+.1           +.5      -.1
for 2.25      .6mm change

0             +1       0
+.18          0        -.18
---------------------------
+.18          +1.00    -0.18
for 45         1.18 mm change


Now to use photodo.com as reference for diffration
figures, using 60% image contrast and reading off
there graph f5.6 as 100 lpmm and f22 as 25 lpmm.
Interporlating these figures gives f11 as 50 lpmm.

Then take 8 lpmm as sharpness on print, cannot rember
reference, Leitz? Then mag magnifiaction:
f22  25/8  => 3X
f11  50/8  => 6X
for f5.6 allow a little loss for genometry of lens
100 - 10%(guess) => 90
f5.6 90/8 => 11X

Now if the 4*5 enlargement is at f22 maxamium image
size is 27*36cm  (11*14 inch print)

If 2.25 neg is enlarged  at f11 maxamium image size 
is 34*34cm  (11*14 inch print)

If 35mm is enlarged at f5.6 max image size
is 26*40cm  (11*14 inch print)

Now assume that lpmm = 1 / 2*coc
for 8 lpmm, coc = 0.06mm

and plugging into the forumla below:

for 35mm:

2 * 5.6 * 0.06 * 12.5/121 = +/-0.07mm
my measured figure above was .26mm (+/-0.13mm) with
glass carrier +/-0.06

for 2.25

2 * 11 * 0.06 * 7/36  = +/-0.26mm
my measured figure above was .60mm (+/-0.30mm)

for 4*5

2 * 22 * 0.06 * 4/9 = +/-1.17mm
My estimate figure above was 1.18mm (+/-0.59mm)

Conclusions:
1. I should get a life and go and take some pictures.
2. Most of this is speculation.
3. At 11x14 print, I need a glass carrier for 35mm
   and it is probably a good idea for 120 roll, 5x4 
   looks better depending on the accuracy of my 
   guessed value.
4. Bigger magnifications, smaller apertures, up to a
   point.
5. For bigger prints than 11x14 from 35mm I need to
   look at negative to lens alignment, 
   shimming the negative carrier using a sticky tape
   looks a good option.
 


Please note that I am not an expert, when my glass
negative carrier arrives I will try a few tests at
12x16 from 35mm onto glossy RC paper.

Regards Richard.

I can't speak for much of the USA as it is a big country. In our area we
have one really good pro shop, Pictureline, in Salt Lake City, Utah and a
few other smaller stores, plus Ritz Camera(Inkleys here) which is basically
a waste of time. Kodak would be more prevalent than any of the competition,
with Ilford in second place. At the smaller shops one seldom finds Agfa,
Forte, Oriental, Cachet, Bergger or many other brands. Pictureline will have
Kodak, Ilford, Agfa, Forte and a couple others, with the film line being a
good pro selection in films to 8x10 size.

In other areas I have been in, mainly in the Rocky Mountain region, Kodak is
represented almost everywhere. Ilford isn't in that many shops as most don't
pay attention to B&W. Many here simply mail order from Adorama or B&H (the
two largest & most reliable) with some using Calumet (costs a bit more but
stone reliable).

When you hit the real Cities such as San Francisco and the like I think
almost every brand is represented. It will take someone who frequents
Gassers, Samy's and the others to comment on them. But many teachers in the
High Schools that I know end up using either Kodak or Ilford, or possibly
the Arista brand from Freestyle. I seldom see many of these teachers using
Agfa materials and I think Agfa and Ilford should put a rep strictly on the
'school beat' and push their products heavily. These kids are the
photography consumers of the future.

Jon,

I had a conversation on this with Lam Lawless, and I take the liberty of
posting a part of his answer to me:

Liam wrote:

Thiourea and thiocyanate are both silver solvents, so when you gold tone
some of the silver is changing to silver chloride as the gold is being
deposited (the chloride coming from the gold chloride).  Even if all the
unexposed silver chloride has been removed by fixing before toning,
therefore, more is made while toning.

In practice, the amount is very small and probably makes little
difference
if it is subsequently turned back to silver by the action of light, but
there is, I suppose, also danger of sulphiding (atmospheric
contaminants,
etc.), which could cause yellowing of highlights.  There is another
reason
for fixing after toning that I don't fully understand, but gold salts
apparently form ligands with organic matter in the paper, and these can
be
harmful to the paper itself in the long term.  Fixing destroys them. 


Hope this helps a bit,

Best,

Cor

Jon,

    I do not fix prints after gold toning ( ammonium thiocyanate,tartaric
acid and sodium chloride bath after selenium or thiourea toning)I have never
observed any change over the years. It is not sure that the gold replace
silver it could be a very thin deposit of colloidal gold. Do not forget that
gold starts first by toning hightlights. It is the inverse for selenium
which start first on blacks. It is why the spliting toning with selenium
followed by gold is so beautiful.

    Daniel

Hi everyone:

At the risk of being flamed for crass commercialism, I would add that we
also stock the Book of Pyro here at Photographers' Formulary for $26.95
US plus postage. 

Book of Pyro recommends a time of 10 minutes at 70F for FP4.


Sincerely,

Bill Bergstrom

Hello,
Is it just me?
I receive some messages posted on Pure Silver arrive as if posted five 
times. Just got 5 identical messages of the post by Dan Cardish on film 
flatness, and before that 5 on toning by Richard K.
It's going on for a couple of days now, and I thought it was a temporary 
glitch... but it isn't.
Did the admin fiddled with some settings in the soft running the list?

I did notice a problem with your mail service - It may have
queued up multiple copies of some emails trying to recover from
whatever disease it had.  Otherwise, the only way you would
see this behavior is if you have subscribed to the list
under multiple and different email addresses which all get
routed to one mailbox.

Thanks for the prompt answer. I only subscribed once to pure-silver list. 
And the multiple messages are only from some members/topics from this 
list. The problem would be with my ISP, I should also be receiving 
multiple messages from other sources...

I believe Daniel is correct in that gold probably forms a colloidal envelope
around the silver 'cor' if you like, leaving the silver intact. This is
thought to be transluscent and imparts the typical colour. It also possibly
accounts for the fact that gold toning sulphided images produces a different
colour - and as richard has pointed out, suitable papers can be pink/blue
toned after split sulphiding. It is readily apparent that when split or as I
prefer to call it 'duo' toning warm or lith prints with Se and gold, it is
wise to do the Se toning into the shadows first and then gold tone whatever
is left, because if you Se tone a previously gold toned print it will change
from blue to brown as the Se changes the 'cor', the new colour of which is
visible through the gold colloid. This is irreversible on re gold toning, as
one would expect.
FWIW I don't refix gold toned prints either, - I agree with Liam's reasoning
but suspect the effect is probably minimal.

  Don't know about GP-1, its a different sort of toner. 
  There are two reasons for fixing. One is simply for the hardener in the
fixer. Nelson's, 
 and Hypo-Alum, are used at elevated temperatures, which cause emulsion
swelling. Its also possible that a certain amount of halide may be produced
by the toning process, which the fixing bath would remove. My best guess is
that its mostly for hardening.
 Tim Rudman probably has a better idea of the chemistry.

 Interesting measurements snipped (long)...

  The fact is that negative poping can be seen easily in a grain focuser. I
notice it most for 35mm and less, but too much, for 120. 4x5 seems to be
heavy enough to resist moving much. The 35mm poping is enough to put the
negatives definitely out of focus.
Glass cariers are a PITA but seem necessary for best sharpness.

Tim,
 I am looking for the URL of a group of images of yours that I found and
lost....I believe they were in response to a book of yours on Lith printing
or something similar. Not only would I like to have this bookmarked but
would appreciate any other URL that has you images on it , for me, and to
pass to some other photo friends.
....... you could post here or if you rather send to
natureseen@mindspring.com
Thanks much,
Chuck

I don't have much presence on the web Chuck (that I know of). I don't have a
web site and am not too much into computer imaging. I'm very much wet
photography based! Silverprint had (?still have?) excerps from my 2nd (lith)
book on their site at www.silverprint.co.uk . I sent some images to the
London Salon site but don't know if it is actually up yet. One of these days
I mean to get into this a bit more but hardly have th time to keep up with
pure silver these days! I don't know where else you might have seen them?
Tim

Luc - I've been having this problem with the alternative process list and in
fact just sent a message similar to yours to that list. I didn't think I was
having the problem with Pure Silver but I'll check more carefully. Brian

Thanks Tim,
 I might have been looking at an enlarged image of your "The Master
Photographer's Lith Printing Course" book cover. { this appears in quite a
few places....:o) } . I'll just put the book on my wish list as Birthday is
close!

Any good tips on paper choices easily available in the US ? { is this in the
book?  :o) }

 I am extremely unhappy with the look of large format images on the
web....have had a website for over a year and won't put any thing up as the
replies from folks that have seen the original prints and then are sent to
test sites is overwhelmingly.....What the heck happened? I actually traded a
large print to a Microsoft web programming expert for the web site and still
the best we could do leaves me with too much contrast and total loss or
highlight and shadow detail and in no way shows my work in a "good light".
>From years of looking at fine prints I think I can imagine what some of your
prints would look like from the web pictures but doubt that the subtle tonal
variances you produce can be shown with present technology. Save your time
for beautiful prints!!

Daniel-

Forgive me!!!

There I sat sipping coffee after rising, not with my full consent, at 5AM,
reading and responding to my e-mail. I have no idea wehat I was thinking -
or not thinking - because I have always fixed my prints after Nelson's gold.

I need to go to the co-op and purchase some Ginkgo....I am not aging
gracefully.

best - Jon

Agfa has been in most stores that I have shopped at but not in as much quantity
as others.  Ilford has quite a good presence.  I only buy paper locally when I
NEED it, most of the time I use Unique Photo.  They carry Agfa, Ilford, blah,
blah.....

One reason that some camera stores carry or push Kodak has to do with the BUy
American philosophy.  Years  back, I worked in a camera store that would only
stock Kodak out of loyalty to US goods.

It could very well be that too many selections of paper  just goes to waste on
camera store shelves since many photographers buy from the big stock houses such
as Adorama, B&H, Freestyle, Unique, etc..

Hmm this is very strange.  I will look into it.  I do occasionally
see the mail system attempting to resend a message to some of you
because it cannot connect to your mail servers.  There are known
problems with broken mail servers which might cause this - and I
cannot do anything about this - I believe the a 'standard' mail
MTA like 'sendmail' would be OK.  Also, as a subscriber myself,
I should see the same problem if it were on the server end here,
but I never do.

When any of you see a duplicate, please send all of the copies
(and only do this once please) to me personally (not the
list) and I'll see if I can make sense of he headers...

Barry,

I have also read this, it is in the Ag + photographic manual section 7.1.

I'm not sure if anyone answered this but Art Craft Chemicals is a good
place, less expensive than Photographers Formulary.

Oh, happy birthday!

Yes there is a list of UK/US/OZ paper equivalent names for the main players
for lith printing, and lists of most papers with 'universal' names that work
in lith or do nice things in lith after redevelopment, together with charts
of exactly what they do in different toners, bleaches etc.

I sympathise with your feelings about reproduction on the web, but I thought
that low res was the name of the game for web images?
Even repro in books can be pretty awful. I am very unhappy about some of the
pics in my lith book for example. Some are really quite good - but some are
just awful. Especially those on textured paper as they gave problems in
scanning and had to be duped first and appeared looking not even remotely
like the originals.

The threads on 1st selenium and then Gold toning have been interesting. Not
too much about the aesthetic side though - almost as if they are only used
for protection. I use a great deal of gold toner and as a 'photographic
artist' rather than a 'recorder' I use it for its beautiful pictorial
qualities.
It is astonishing what a range of colours can be had from a bottle of gold
toner - right across the spectrum from sunny yellow through salmon to pink
to red to purple to blue to blue/black. Amazing. (even metallic gold if you
like that sort of thing)

I wonder what other favourite toners people use? (this should keep us going
for a while! sadly I shall be away for a week after Sunday)

I have been experimenting with FSA toner recently (Thiourea Dioxide) -
that's an interesting if fickle 'toner' (actually a reducer)

I should perhaps add that I was talking (re fixing) about one bath gold
(thiocyante based) toner done for aesthetic effect rather than GP - 1 or 2

  Sulfite oxidizes to sulfate. Sodium sulfate is often used in tropical
developers because it tends to reduce emulsion swelling, and thus, slows
down the diffusion rate of development. The swelling reduction is through
"salt effect" rather than by hardening. Hardeners cross-link the molecules
of the gelatin, raising its melting point and physical hardness. Typical
inorganic hardeners are aluminum sulfate and chromium sulfate. Sodium
sulfate is not a hardener in this way. 
  Sodium sulfate probably has little or no effect on washing time. Aluminum
sulfate (Alum) does, over a rather narrow pH range. It has some sort of
mordanting action for thiosulfate. Sulfite wash aid seems to undo the
mordanting, so washing rates for alum hardened emulsions after treatment
with wash aid are faster than even un-hardened emulsion. Treating alum
hardened emulsion with an alkali such as a carbonate or metaborate, also
reduces or eliminates the effect of the hardener by taking the emulsion out
of the pH range where the mordanting effect happens.
  It is interesting that emulsions hardened with chrome alum (chrome
sulfate) wash out at the same rate as unhardened emulsion, despite a pH or
around 2 necessary for the hardener to work. The retarding of washing seems
to be an effect specifically of aluminum sulfate at a pH of around 4.2
(have to check this number, I am going by memory).
  Sodium sulfite, per se, does not, AFAIK have any effect on washing rate.
It should neither slow it nor does it have the ion exchange effect of sulfite.
  The reason for using wash aid to dilute Selenium toner was only as a
convenience when using highly diluted toner. It saved having a separate
wash aid step. The assumptions made are that the toner would be used pretty
much one-shot and that toning times would be compatable with wash aid
treatment times. It is also assumed that the capacity of the high dilution
of KRST is limited enough so that the short life of the wash aid would not
result in waste.
  When KRST is used three steps are necessary. One, treatment of the print
in a wash aid or alkali bath to adjust the pH to neutral or slightly
alkaline. This is to prevent the possibility of staining by the toner. Two,
the toning itself. Three, treating the toned print in wash aid. The last is
not strictly necessaryl but will cut down washing time for fiber prints.
KRST has enough hypo in it to require washing it out. Wash aid will cut
down the required time just as it does for a freshly washed print. 
  KRST diluted in water has a long shelf life, although highly diluted
toner has limited capacity. Life of wash aid working solutions is very
limited, no more than eight hours in a tray. It should be thought of as a
one-shot expendible.
  Mike Gudzinowicz, an organic chemist who posts to the darkroom group, has
suggested that even fairly strong dilutions of KRST can be made using a
solution of metaborate. I don't have details at hand but will search
Deja.com to see if I can find them. In any case an alkali pre-toning bath
should be about 2% carbonate or metaborate. Wash aid serves the same purpose. 
  The sulfates refered to in the handbook were probably aluminum and
chromium sulfate.

I've been looking for a source for anti-static resealable bags for my
4x5 film holders. 'Found a source today - $14 buys 100 6" x 8" bags - just
right for a 4x5 holder.  They have other sizes for you 2x3, 8x10, and 11x14
sheet film shooters.

If you order from these folks, tell 'em you heard about them on the
pure-silver mailing list - I get nothing out of this, but you never
know, you might get a discount or something...

Happy weekend all...

  Ilford's method is based on the idea that thiosulfate and fixing reaction
products get into the fibers of fiber based paper and are hard to remove.
It is the support which is the concern. 
 Thiosulfate washes out of the emulsion as a diffusion process. If the
concentration of thiosulfate in the water in contact with the emulsion is
kept low, the rate of diffusion is maximized. Most emulsions wash out
quickly. 
  Thiosulfate is held in the paper fibers by a sort of molecular
attraction. Ilford speculates that thare are frictional forces involved.
Even though wash aid speeds up the washing of the paper support the
thiosulfate still tends to stay there, once it gets in. 
  Ilford's reasoning is to minimize the time available for the fixer to
soak into the fibers by using the fastest method of fixing. Their tests of
residual thiosulfate in the support show that exposure time under a minute
are disirable, two minutes being about the limit before the time of
exposure no longer matters. 
  Their original recommendation was to use an ammonium thiosulfate fixer
mixed at film strength. This will fix _some_ paper emulsions in thirty
seconds. However, it will not fix all emulsions in that time so the
recommended time was extended to one minute, which still keeps the
concentration of thiosulfate in the paper fibers at a low level.
  There is a problem with some emulsions, which simply will not fix out in
the required short time. The Ilford method can not be used for them,
although a variation of it will still work.
  The idea of using two successive fixing baths is to insure complete
conversion of the halides to a water soluble form. The process is not
completed if the fixer has passed a certain, rather low, capacity.
Therefore, for general use, deviding the fixing process into two parts
helps to insure the completeness of fixing, and extends the capacity of the
baths. 
  The process is to start with two fresh baths. The paper or film is fixed
in each for half the total fixing time, with a drain period, or short
rinse, between them. The first bath does most of the fixing. The second
bath remains relatively fresh and will convert any remaining insoluble or
partly soluble fixing reaction products to the soluabe form.
  When the first bath reaches its capacity it is replaced by the second
bath and the second bath with a fresh bath. The capacity of fixer to
completely fix emulsion is extended by about four to ten times by this
method. 
  The complete conversion of the halides to soluble form is important
because the intermediate products will eventually attack the image if there
is more than a very small residue left.
  The problem with applying this method to the Ilford technique it that
there is simply not enough time to do it. As a result, the capacity of the
fixing bath used for the Ilford technique is strictly limited. Probably
fixing should be done one print at a time, and nearly one-shot for the fixer. 
  The Ilford method _does_ work for paper which fixes out fast enough. 
  The degree of fixing can be determined by using a test bath consisting of
either 10% Sodium Sulfide, or 1:9 Kodak Selenium Toner*. Either will stain
remaining halides in the emulsion a yellow or brown color. Kodak publishes
a set of color chips for comparison. There is a simple chart for checking
prints in the _Kodak Black-and-White Darkroom Dataguide_ and an overlay for
film is available. 
  A very small amount of stain is acceptable for prints which are not going
to be toned, but, as should be obvious, both test solutions are toners,
which points up that pretty complete fixation is needed for clean toning. 
  According to Dr. Nishimura, in private correspondence, the Ilford
researchers were quite aware of the fact that trace amounts of hypo
stabilize the image silver. Evidently, the Ilford method is compatible with
this. 
  When a print is toned enough with either sulfide or selenium (and
probably with gold also) it becomes much more tollerant of both hypo and
halide residues, althogh good fixing and good washing are still necessary. 
* Kodak has been recommending the KRST solution over the sulfide test since
it is more stable and the colors more nearly match the printed chart.

 It is astonishing what a range of colours can be had from a bottle of gold

Tim,
I have also experimented with FSA toner after reading two articles, 'The 
ultimate toner' by Michael Maunder in issue 6 of Ag+ photographic and an 
article entitled 'The best kept toner secret' by Tony McLean in the then 
Photon magazine.

As you say, it is a reducing agent and works by redeveloping the image after 
bleaching. The original description of the method is attributed to 
George.L.Wakefield in the 1970's.

By varying the bleach and mixing the FSA with either sodium carbonate or 
sodium hydroxide a wide range of image colours are available. This is a 
result of the variation in crystal size/shape due to the different rates of 
formation.

It is claimed that because this toner works by development and not by 
changing what is already there, it should work with all papers even those 
that are difficult to tone using traditional methods.

The article by Tony McLean contains some formula and illustrations of some of 
the effects. If anyone is interested in this I could scan the article and 
Email it direct to them as an attachment. Alternatively I could type the 
formula into a posting.

I cannot say that I have a favourite toner, but work mainly with 
Thiocarbamide, Gold and Selenium. Probably about 15% of my work is toned for 
pictorial effect, but what stimulates me about this is that so often the 
final result is unique.

That is exactly correct Michael. Also because it is a redeveloper (producing
colours by developng finely divided colloidal silver) it can still be toned
in other toners too. As you will have found out, it can increase the density
of the blacks considerably too (by a factor of 2.3 approx) so it has to be
printed for [- or used on weak prints ;-) ]  It's greatest flexibility comes
with the use of different halide bleaches though and very different effects
come from bleaches based on bromide, chloride or iodide.

To expand the dicussion beyond the current selenium and gold, t might be
interesting to know what are peoples favourite other toners?
Or for that matter - their least favourite
                                mine (least favourite) is green...
especially cobalt!
Tim

Michael,
    I am very interested in getting the article and also the formula. You
can send them directly to me at daniel.bouzard@wanadoo.fr
I also do a lot of tonings.
Many thanks

Richard - Thanks for such a detailed message. With respect to the selenium
1-9 test, is this done with the print straight out of the fixer or after the
print has been washed?

Hi Tim - The gold toner sounds interesting. I remember trying Nelson's gold
toner once and it was very time consuming and a pain to mix. If I remember
correctly, the formula I was using called for quantities of one chemical so
small that it was impossible to be sure you had the right amount. Also, I
think it was done in two stages, with the first stage sitting over night
before moving to the second stage. Is this normal or was it peculiar to the
formula and chemicals I was using (which I got from Photographers' Formulary
as I recall).

What gives rise to the variations in the tones it produces?

I've been experimenting a good bit with some of the toners and formulas
shown in the back of Eddie Ephraim's (sp?) book. I've obtained some nice
tones with several of the formulas but have had a lot of trouble with
consistency from batch to batch (i.e. I have difficulty repeating something
I like). Brian

I've seen all of the messages about anti-static bags and now I'm finally
prompted to ask my probably dumb question . . . what's the big deal with
static and storage bags? I understand that static attracts dust but how
much/often can you create static with bags used to store film holders? I
mean, you put the holder in it, you take it out, you do that twice, usually
with a lot of time between the time you first put it in and the time you
last take it out. So where does all the static with which we are concerned
come from? Is static generated when the holder is just sitting there in the
bag?

I think the point is that a holder with no bag tends to attract dust just by
sitting in the bag.  Many photographers thus put the holder in a ZipLoc to try
to minimize the dust which collects on the dark slide surface which will later
face inward after the exposure (this does not affect that exposure, but adds
to the total dust in the film holder when used later).   In low humidity
environments - e.g., Chicago in Winter - there is a tendency of the plastic
holder to attract and hold even more dust than usual.  Moreover, moving
the holder around in this kind of static prone environment can cause
even more static buildup.


The theory is (and we'll see if it works) is that an anti-static bag will minimize
this because it not only keeps dust out but *dissipates* static build up on the
holder as it is inserted and removed. (Anti-static bags have a metallic layer to 
do just this.)  As I said, we'll see if this makes any noticeable difference.
For $14 it is worth a try..

 The fact is that negative poping can be seen easily in a grain focuser. I

Glass cariers are a PITA but seem necessary for best sharpness.

There are two separate issues here I think. Sure, negative popping is a
PITA, but even before popping through heat occurs, negatives in glassless
carriers in 35mm and, especially it seems, 120 are very 'wavy'. In practice,
a single top glass, or the Leitz old style single condenser face, seem more
than adequate to flatten things down. I have not spent much time on
examining the problem with 5x4. I will do so.
Also in practice, I have found the claimed problems with keeping glass dust
free wildly overstated. The problem is not really keeping glasses dust
free - that's simple, it is film which attracts dust like a magnet. To a
certain extent, a top glass actually seems to stop this dust attraction by
the negative while working with the negative in the enlarger.

Try using a ready made gold toner as from Tetenal or Fotospeed. Simplicity
itself. It comes in a ready to use solution - pour in dish, put in print,
take out print, wash (print).

The colours depend on how you process the paper and on which paper you use.
Very simply - warm tone papers go to a blue, the warmer the bluer as a rule.
Cold tone papers do little, neutral papers may go a steely blue black - they
vary a lot and also with the developer used. Lith prints go to a bright blue
end point but some (eg Transtar TP5) may go through reds to purples on the
way if dev'd to a very warm tone in lith dev. Prints sepia toned (or split
sepia) and then gold toned go either to a salmon, a pink, orange or red -
some almost complete the circle and go to a purlpy red - the colour after
sepia depends on the paper and on the colour sepia chosen (especially with
variable sepia toners based on thiocarbamide and sodium hydroxide additive).
Colder tones and colder papers tend more towards reds. Papers like tetenal's
vario comfort give really good red instead of orangey pinks. Gold after
bleaching back in ferricanide will often give sunny yellows - again papers
do vary, some will go on towards orange.
You have a lot of other variable controls too such as how long you tone, how
fresh the toner is, what dev was used, bleaching back in different bleaches
and redev'ing in different developers (can make a lot of difference) - but
perhaps that is for later on. Often the subtle eary effects are especially
nice before it goes too far, but that is down to taste of course.
Oh I nearly forgot, you can split tone with sepia and with selenium for some
really nice effects - again papers and processing techniques vary the result
a lot.

When we leave the film holders in modern nylon bags, coupled with humidity
levels in the single digits, along with cold, we get static marks at times
from the 'mini lightening storms' when we take the holders out of the bags.

Cold and dry are real static generators. Couple that with nylon and the
newer clothing and bag materials made from synthetics and static generates
pretty easily. It isn't as much a problem when the humidity is high but here
in the desert west of the USA that is seldom.

When we leave the film holders in modern nylon bags, coupled with humidity
levels in the single digits, along with cold, we get static marks at times
from the 'mini lightening storms' when we take the holders out of the bags.

Cold and dry are real static generators. Couple that with nylon and the
newer clothing and bag materials made from synthetics and static generates
pretty easily. It isn't as much a problem when the humidity is high but here
in the desert west of the USA that is seldom.

Hi All,

I over exposed several 4x5 Tri-X negatives last week and I would like to
reduce the density slightly to allow easier printing. These were processed
in HC-110 BTW, dil. B.

What is the "best" method for reducing the overall negative density of the
negatives? I presume the most common method would be to use potassium
ferricyanide (Farmer's reducer.) What formulas are recommended? I've found
in the past some of the formulas listed by AA are way too "hot" to be
controllable for print bleaching. As a matter of fact their ratios of ferri
to sodium thiosulfate from several sources seem to be all over the map. So
I'm a bit confused about what is an appropriate recipe. I'm not very
experienced with negative reduction so please bear with me if I am asking
irrelevant or ignorant questions.

Thanks,

Don Bryant

Chaps

You know how it is - just went down to the local camera store to 'look'
at a Hasselblad and after teetering on the brink for months now about
going MF (thanks for the earlier past advice on pure-silver about this),
we came away with a 501CM Camera Kit (Body, A12 Back and 80mm Lens) plus
a 50mm Lens.  Not sure if we needed it or just wanted it but we have it anyway.

In the US, Hasselblad is currently offering a promotional rebate which
offers a PM-45 Prism Finder value $1K against purchase of 510CM Camera
kits which is pretty nice, so we will get one of those FOC from those
nice peeps at Hasselblad :-)  However, our dilemma is that for the 50mm
Lens that we also purchased, there is also a rebate promotion for a FOC
A12, A16 or A24 Back - according to our choice.  Although we are not, at
least yet, of the square picture school, we don't see the point in the
A16 (it can't rotate anyway) which leaves an A12 or A24.  We are
thinking about an A24 so that on our fun field trips we don't have to
reload so often in the open but wonder if this is really the best
decision?  I seem to recall some comments in the past on pure-silver
expressing concern over ease of handling 220 film or something like
that?  Our experience using our 35mm gear is that we often don't use all
the frames.  BTW, if the budget can stand it we plan on buying a 150mm
lens as well before the rebate promotion expires, which will provide a
second FOC A12, A16 or A24 Back, giving a total of three.  We generally
take black and white or black and white images.

The attraction to us of extra Backs is that quite often we have had to
rewind film on our 35mm kit so that we can change from slow to fast film
or visa versa, etc.  Not sure if we really need three though but since
it is FOC...

If anyone is able to offer any advice on the following questions, it
would be very much appreciated.  We don't want to reinvent the wheel.

1. Does and A24 sound sensible?  Sylvia and I reckon we can record who
takes which frame without fighting too often, so we won't need to
continuously swap backs on that account

2. We use a Paterson spiral tank for our film developing.  Is 220 film
difficult to load into these and/or are there any other 220 handling
issues that we should be aware of?

3. What is the experience of others who have made the transition to MF -
should we sell some or all of our Leica M6 gear to avoid bankruptcy or
hang onto it for ease of hiking, PJ style photos and occasional 35mm
slides, etc?

Any and all opinions would be very helpful.

Regards
Malcolm (& sylvia)

Barry,

I agree with you that the Leitz Focomat (in particular the IC) solution is
unsurpassed... but remember that it is 'de rigeur' to use the dedicated
slip-on Anti-Newton glass under the condenser. Printers buying old Focomats
without the AN glass will suffer associated problems... and finding a
second-hand, or new, AN glass for a IC is like looking for hen's teeth.

Michael, Daniel,

You should both have in your files a copy of the pre-C&D magazine "Darkroom
User"
(issue 1998#1) which included the illustrated article on FSA by Tony McLean.

BTW: If lurkers are interested in seeing this article please contact me
off-list... I have a few copies of this issue in stock (costing $5 inc
postage to the States) for one month only before all the stock of
back-issues are transfered to Nova Darkrooms Limited prior to my move to
France.

One 'problem' with the 24 on back is the reduced choice of film types
packaged in the way-al least here in the UK so this aspect may be worth
checking against your favourite emulsions.

Why not purchase the mini vacuum cleaner, sold by Jessops in the UK for 10,
and carry this with you. You can then vacuum any surfaces prior to inserting
the darkslide and the camera surfaces.

Hi All -

I think your questions are very good ones and ones that are tough to
fathom out ahead of time - it's not until you have used your kit for
awhile that you will know what is most natural.  I have owned a hasselblad
"kit" and an M6, side-by-side for many years.  I couldn't live without
either.  I was using the Hassy for years on a tripod for my fine art work
but am now getting conversant with an 8x10 camera and enlarger for that 
sort of thing :-) The Hasselblad is now relegated to event photography -
the venue where it really shines.

Here's my advice:

1) forget A24 backs.  They are for color work primarily...weddings in
particular.  They are used at weddings so the photographer can keep
shooting.  There is so little choice left in 220 B&W as to be nearly
obsolete.  Use 120 in an A12 back and change film more often -OR- if you
don't mind funky, get a couple of mint 12 backs for cheap and you can use
both 120 and 220 (with a little "trick" for the 220).

2) if you prefer the rectangle, Hasselblad make masking kits to use with
the square backs.

3) don't malign the A16.  I prefer the square myself but the Hassy is no
bigger than any of the 645s so you're not making a huge sacrifice by
getting the A16.  The only thing is, you'll need a PM90 prism instead of
the 45 (it is cheaper, though, than the 45) so you can use the camera in
portrait mode.

4) Do not, do not, do not get rid of your M6.  A hasselblad is no
substitute for the fast handling, ever at the ready, spontaneous M6.  I
spend several days a year in NYC, photographing on the street.  You just
can't do that with a Hassy.  You can do much PJ with the Hassy, in fact,
because it's just much too noisy, slow and heavy.  But, for what it does
do well, it's worth its weight in gold.

Enjoy,
Curt

 You should both have in your files a copy of the pre-C&D magazine "Darkroom

 (issue 1998#1) which included the illustrated article on FSA by Tony McLean.
 
 BTW: If lurkers are interested in seeing this article please contact me
 off-list... I have a few copies of this issue in stock (costing $5 inc
 postage to the States) for one month only before all the stock of
 back-issues are transfered to Nova Darkrooms Limited prior to my move to
 France.

 Camera & Darkroom magazine >>

Ed,

Yes, I have just had a look. The text of the article is the same although the 
illustrations are different. How did I forget; probably because I cut 
interesting articles out of other mags and file them in an A4 binder with an 
index and then throw the magazine away because it usually contains nothing 
else of interest. This is not the case with C&D and 'darkroom user' I retain 
these intact on my bookshelf, I have not seen any practical way of binding 
them; unless someone else knows different.

An index of course would be invaluable, but this would probably be quite a 
task.

Thanks for a great publication.
Michael Spedding.

Thanks for your advice.  You are absolutely right, it is too late to
decide what you really want once you have bought something and used it
for a while but you don't know for sure what you need until you buy it,
which is why I am so grateful for your input.  Please see my comments on
CAPS below...

YOU KNOW I TOUGHT ABOUT THIS OVERNIGHT AFTER 'PLAYING' WITH THE

Tim ,
 You may be on to things with the anti-static bags!
 My wife works with a company that has to deal with plastic and static
constantly and from what I can find through that source there is not a way
to take regular plastic and remove the static. Even with the best anti
static removers and chemical treatments the static will return within hours
if the humidity is low . I asked about the anti static bags you mentioned
and at least got the answer " hey, that might just work!"
I live in a humid area without the static problems but love to travel back
to Alaska and the colder regions as soon as winter and snow start so will be
trying your idea if I can find some 8x10 bags. I wonder how the 4x5
ready/quick load films are affected?

As it turns out, I grew up in Alaska and now live in the Chicago area -
both places with lots-o-cold weather and static.  Static affects everything,
but especially those things which are being moved in and out of another
medium - e.g., A darkslide being pulled out of a holder or a holder
being inserted/removed from a bag.  As I said, we'll see if this solution
makes any difference...  The place I mentioned in my original post
also has bags large enough for your 8x10 holders.

Well, th trick only works with the old 12 backs, not with the new A12
backs: you reset the counter when you wind on past number 12 on the
counter.  You also need to plug up the peep hole so you don't light-strike
the film.

That may work for you...but I'm dyslexic and need to have a concrete
object field or I can't mentally crop.  Ansel could.  I'm not Ansel (but I
was out making lots of nice pictures on this glorious New England day with
my 8x10).

Pretty close, I expect.  Not completely.  Just understand that this finder
presents the ocular at a 45 degree angle to the film plane.  The 90 is
just like a Nikon - straight through.

And, if you are working with the square, it's fine.  It's no good if you
get a 645 back and want to make vertical pictures, however.  I use both
types as the need presents itself.

It's only money.  Just remember: with either of theses cameras, it's like
having money in the bank.  The don't depreciate like a car.

The Artar does not have any cemented elements (a 4/4 design), so the type
of head need not be a consideration.

There are potential problems compared to enlarging lenses. First, the
angle of coverage is narrow, which might require a longer than "normal"
lens to cover the format. Also, for optimum corner sharpness, the lens 
should be stopped down to at least f/22. Flare should not be a problem
with coated lenses.

I've used Schneider APO Artars as enlarging lenses for large negatives
(8x10" and larger), and they were fine. However, the print magnification
was not great. For large magnifications from smaller formats (MF),
enlarging
give better results and are more convenient.

I'd greatly appreciate if you'd send this to me-an attachment is fine, 
especially if it (the original article) contains any reproductions of images 
toned in this manner!  Thanks.

Thinking of using Goerz Red Dot Artar as enlarging lenses. They're in 
barrel (the ones I have), so easy to mount on an enlarger lens board. 
Anybody done that? Comments? (beside the small relative aperture?).
I was thinking that the old ones being designed as process lens should do 
just fine as enlarging lens. And with a cold light, the heat should not 
be a problem for the cemented lenses.

Good Pure-Silver people,

The recent flurry of enlarger lens questions has provoked me to ask my own
nagging question.

The enlarger I use is an old and very well preserved Omega B-8, which I
bought about five years ago.

The lenses I got with it appear to be the original lenses that came with the
package (a 50 f/3.5 and a 90 f/4.5).  They're labeled as
"Rodenstock-Omegaron, Lens Made In Germany", which suggests that they were
made by Rodenstock for Omega.  Or maybe a buyer at Omega just thought it was
cute that they were named the same as the enlarger?

Does anyone out there know the provenance of these lenses?  And more to the
point, how good are they?  I haven't noticed any specific issues with their
sharpness, but I do continue to wonder if I would see increased sharpness,
better light transmission, etc. if I went to a more modern lens.  It would
certainly be easier to focus accurately if I went to a newer lens with a
wider maximum aperture.


any thoughts or advice on where to seek further wisdom would be appreciated.


aloha

The easy way to find out is to test:

Take a pi of a window screen and then project the negative
at desired size - focus, and possibly even print this.  The
screen mesh should be sharp edge edge.  If it is not, try
stopping the enlarger down and printing again.  This assumes,
of course that the negative is sharp ;))  You can also take
a picture of a page of newsprint to do this test...

>Thinking of using Goerz Red Dot Artar as enlarging lenses.
>
The Red Dot Artars work like a champ for enlarging.  They are a process lens
design, so the field is flat.  Infinify focus coverage is small (ca 45deg)
but at enlarging distances, a 12 inch works fine for 8x10.    F/9 is not a
problem  with big negatives since they let a ton of light through.  Ran some
8x10s on an old Elwood w/150 watt bulb on Ilford MGIV - exposures on the
order of 15-25 sec at f/22-32 for 16x20 prints - WOW 2X enlargement.

Do your final focusing at the exposure f stop to eliminate any focus shift
that the lens may have.

Larger antistatic bags should be available from the electronics industry as
printed circuit boards containing static sensitive devices are placed in
them when being moved around.
Probly not so cheap though.

@Home, the people who provide me w/internet access have given me a
dispensation to keep running my servers until my new provider gets
me back on the air....

HOWEVER, this is contingent on tbem not hearing *any* complaints about
this server.  In particular, if we get spammed (unlikely since I've closed
the list) PLEASE DO NOT REPLY IN ANY FASHION TO THE OFFENDING SENDER -
this is what got me in trouble w/@Home in the first place - someone beefed
about spam to the sending ISP, apparently in way that ticked off the ISP
and I got tagged for being the source (I know, I know, it doesn't make
sense, but then again it's The Net).  Also, as Richard K. has pointed out
repeatedly, replying to spam merely confirms your email address as valid
and on-the-air.

If we get spammed - be patient - I WILL HANDLE IT DIRECTLY.  I hate to
be noisy about this, but we're hanging on a string for the next 30-45 days
until I can get the new DSL pulled into here, change the DNS servers,
and enter into unencumbered server usage.

Patience is a virtue - blessings upon all of you for exhibiting it...

Well, it seems that I'm not as smart as I thought I was (my wife coulda
told you all that!).  pure-silver was running in a mode that made it
possible for non-subscribers to post messages to the list.  I have just
fixed this - it's interesting that we've been running for years in this
configuration and I never noticed it before.

Anyway, what this means is that if you send the list mail AND your
From: field in your mailer program does not match the email address under
which you subscribed, your messages will no longer get through.

For example, suppose you subscribed as:  JoePhotog@photo.hobby.com

But at work, you are:                    JoeCorporate@BigCo.com

You will *not* be able to send the list email from work unless you change your
From: (and possibly even your Reply To:) settings in your mail program to
joephotog@photo.hobby.com

This makes the list a little less convenient to use for people who have 
multiple email IDs, but it also goes a long way to keep the riff-raff out.

I'd like to thank all those who gave me insight, and suggestions, last week, 
re: my vegan/gelatin philosophical dilemma.

While for the time being I will be continuing my present activities 
unchanged, I will use the information to research, over the course of time, 
avenues for less cruel forms of self-expression.

Hello.
I'm one of the many who want to do this photography thing to the best
of my ability. To this end, I have steadily attempted to replace my
start-out-cash-starved-student-kit with the best I can afford. The one
piece of equipment I did not want to cut corners on was the enlarger
lens. So I've saved my pennies and purchased a Schneider APO 150 F4
HM. (Unfortunately at the point of buying I did not know that there
was such a list as pure silver, and so relied on brochures and
salesmen for advice). Predictably optimum aperature is 1.5 - 2 stops
down from F4, but I'm concerned that the corners (through the peak
focus finder) loose sharpness. I have not managed to cure this through
realignment of the enlarger and so ask three Questions.
1. Does anyone have experience of this lens, and if so is it good or
bad?
2. Assuming that this particular design of lens is as good as the
makers claim, can duds get through the system?
3. Did I fall for the "you get what you pay for" hook line and sinker?
(Is there a better lens for 5X4?).
Scott.

Hello again.
I'm thinking of buying a lens and hope you do not mind if I ask for
opinions.
Does anyone have anything good or bad to say about the 110 XL from
Schneider.
It seems to combine lightness with extraordinary coverage.
Comments would be appreciated.
Scott.

Hi again.
I'm going to be in South Africa soon and wonder if anyone has any
knowledge of particularly good areas for pure self indulgent landscape
photography. This could include Namibia or Botswana. Anybody been
there? Any favourite places?

At the same time I read a thread a while back that covered the
different colour light at higher altitudes (i.e. bluer), and the
effects this has on films speed, and the use of filters. Johannesburg
for example is 5000 ft above sea level and the Drakensburgs are around
9-10,000 ft, is this high enough to present a problem with or with out
filters?
If so, bearing in mind that I process all the film back here in the
UK, any advice?
Scott

All

You will have to forgive me for asking a question that may have already
been covered in an earlier thread when I was not paying proper attention
on this subject but just how good are Meopta enlargers please?  We
looked at a Durst M70 which costs approximately $2,000 in the US or the
same if sourced from the UK.  We definitely do not want to cut corners
to the point of wishing we had bought something else but seem to recall
Barry Thornton enthusing over Meopta enlargers.  This is to use with our
new Hasselblad.

The MAGNIFAX 4 Multigrade Head costs less than a third of the cost of a
Durst M70.  Does anyone have any comments on what would we be loosing
(if anything) with the Meopta - the difference in price is enough to buy
a enlarging lens and leave a fair chunk of change too.  Are there any
problems with spare parts?  Shipping from the UK is not a big deal but
does anyone know of an importer into the US for Meopta?

How about the Meogon S 80mm enlarging lens - I was thinking of the f4
which is illuminated.  Does anyone have any experience with these or
alternative suggestions such as Schneider, etc.?  Again we don't want to
buy twice but maybe the Meogon S is a great lens?  We are making
enlargements up to 11"x14" and for reasons that I don't understand, I
gather that an APO lens is not always best for smaller sizes such as this.

As always your help is very much appreciated.

Regards
Malcolm and Sylvia

Boy, that's a sad one!
I have the same lens and have great results. Since you have re- aligned the
enlarger { Hopefully both the film to lens and the lens to paper plane or
baseboard } you seem to be heading in the right direction on tracking down
the problem - and you do have a problem as this lens should do a good job.
I use several enlargers to be able to keep printing -while one enlarger is
set up I can do test on another. I was using a reg. non Apo Componon S and
when I added another enlarger I bought the Apo version. I can see no real
difference without a glass neg holder. With the glass holder I { at least
think } I can see some better resolution at the edges. I have absolutely
great edge sharpness so am at a loss to your problems. As far as the glass
neg holder is concerned I'm not sure that it doesn't slightly degrade the
sharpest point in the center but it does hold the negs flat giving better
edge sharpness. I use this lens for making 30x40 inch prints { sometimes
slightly cropped so actually larger than 30 x 40 }. Very Sharp with grain
sharp and very well defined at the edges. As to the HYPE...I'm not sure that
I feel that the lens is any great deal sharper than the older S model but it
seems to have BETTER coverage and I do like the extra stop which allows the
image to snap into and out of focus easier. I have actually used it wide
open with Fuji Velvia and a double mask to print a 30 x 40 { even with 500
watts a 4 minute exposure } The resulting image is sharp edge to edge. I
would seek to find an answer from another problem as much as possible first
but I've heard rare occurrences of poor lens assembly and in the case all
else fails maybe that is the problem. If you could test it on another
enlarger or borrow a lens to test your enlarger, that might work to check
just the lens for problems . There ARE slight differences in my enlargers
even though I have a quality enlarger alignment tool. Just tightening down
the screws that hold the lens { flange mounted } can be seen to move the
alignment. You didn't mention the size of prints you make but 20x24 should
be sharp edge to edge - if you make larger prints you loose coverage { as
the lens moves toward the film } so the fact that I easily make 30 x40 the
coverage should be large enough for any smaller prints.
Good luck. This should not be happening!

Just another thought on enlargers - You might want to think about an old
Beseler 45. They are less than $400. dollars US. Color head can be had
 great for B&W variable contrast } for less than $500 dollars sometimes. I
have three for smaller format printing and although they took an afternoon
to align they work great! Ansel Adams used them for years and some of his
better known prints were made on them - The Hassy prints were made this way.
I know that many folks put great stock in their enlarger choice but the real
truth is that all you need is even light  - lens, film plane, baseboard
alignment and a quality lens to give top quality prints.

I write about this same problem in my new book with demonstration pictures.
I bought a new Schneider Componon 'S' 50mm f2.8. It was very ordinary.
Tested against a Meopta Anaret costing less than 30, it was inferior. I
sent it back to the then importers who realigned the elements. It was fine
then, though still didn't BETTER the Anaret. This shouldn't happen with a
top price make, but it did. Not only that, the standard of finish on the
Componon, plastic, is also very ordinary.
I have Meogons Ss in 80 and 50mm. Both are better than the equivalent
Componons in optical performance, and are streets ahead in barrel finish -
nicely finished metal with real heft.
Because of my poor experience with the 50mm Componon S, and also with
optically with a Componon S 135, before I got the Meogons (provided by the
importer for test for my book) I had bought an 80mm Apo Rodagon. It was
inferior to the 80mm Durst Neonon I then used, and then to the Meogon S when
that arrived. I complained to Rodenstock. I found out that it only performed
well at one predetermined aperture, f5.6, and that superiority only showed
over a non-apo Rodagon at f5.6 at over 10x magnification. Below this, the
'standard' lens may actually be superior. That agreed with what I was
seeing.
It is important to realise that this term Apo is being used in a misleading
way. None of these lens carrying this tag are apochromatic i.e. bring three
colours of light at the same point (bit of an oversimplified definition). We
are being had!.
Having said all that, your lens should give sharpness to the corners at its
optimum aperture. (I don't know what that aperture is for the 150mm lens) I
would not hesitate to send it back - I would not mess about. My opinion is
that quality control standards for enlarging objectives are not as tight as
they ought to be. You see big variations in performance from identical
models.
Just as a matter of interest, in the seven 50mm lenses I tested for my book,
the 20 or 30 year old Leitz Focotar f4.5 five element outperformed any other
modern lens I own including the Meogon S!

The Magnafax is a better enlarger than the Durst M70 in terms of practical
facilities for fine printing, and it is very sturdy. There are lots of
easily available accessories for it too that are all reasonably priced. Many
of them fit other Meopta enlargers too. You would find things like the
separate tilt on head and lens panel a real boon, and the substantial build
of the heavy metal negative carrier (glass or glassless to choice) with a
really accurate rangefinder focusing device built in reassuring too.
However, the standard of finish is not up to the Durst class, and it is made
largely from pressed steel rather than aluminium castings. It looks ugly too
compared to the Durst. Though, after a while, like an ugly but faithful and
completely trustworthy dog, you come to love it, looks and all.
You would also find the odd left side focusing knob a pain at first until it
became a habit to use your left hand.
As far as the Meogon lenses are concerned, in side by side tests, the
Meogons I have outperform the Companions - see my reply to Scott's email. In
a number of tests by consumer photographic magazines over the years, my
findings about the Meogons' superiority have been confirmed. They are also
significantly better finished in heavy metal, not plastic, barrels. I handle
my gear with loving care, but the plastic barrel of my Componon S split
after about 5 years use.
The then importer of the Meogons into the UK, when I commented on the
amazing improvement in the standard of finish of the Meogon and Anaret
lenses said that they had imported west European production and design
expires after the wall came down. They do a great deal of subcontract
manufacture for West European makers too now he said, including, guess who?,
Schneider.
That said, I do not believe the quality control of enlarging lens
manufacture is what it should be based on a number of poor buying
experiences I have had over the years. My strong advice is not to buy unless
you can try first; or simply return for exchange or a refund after testing.
You do need a good standard to test against though. In my experience, the
un-glamorous Durst Neonons have always provided such a standard in 80mm. Now
there's an invitation to a blizzard of dissatisfied Neonon buyers!

Freestyle Sales Co.   Their paper catalog has some Meopta enlargers and
enlarging lenses.  The online catalog seems to only have the lenses:

Do you think that the lenses shipped to the US are packaged different than
the UK versions?

  I have at least 7 Componon S lenses and all are in very nice metal
housings. The Apo 150 is also in a very nice all metal housing with a very
ingenious plexi-glass light gathering device to light the f/stops{ big
deal...:o) }. All are smooth in the aperature ring movement and in my case
outpreformed the Apo Rodagons I had { which seems to be the same case you
state with the Apo Rodagons. - I say outpreformed - what I should say is the
the Apo rodagons were contrastier but seemed to actually have less
resolution - contrast is meningless at this point as a 1/4 grade difference
in the light head on MGIV corrected that diff. }
  BTW the poor assembly of lenses is something to think about! I guess I'm
one of the lucky ones that, as yet, have had no problems over the years.

OK.
Further revealing my naivety I have to ask another question in the
light of the responses to date.
Sure I worked on the alignment of all three planes, neg. lens and
baseboard. But what else could be wrong with the enlarger? I ask this
in the context of your suggestion below to try the lens on another
enlarger. The lens is on a devere 507, so coverage should not be an
issue for the little 5X4 negs, should it? (The enlarger is, although
second hand, new to me!) and if this could be a part of the problem it
would save Schneider some ear ache.
Once again many thanks
Scott

Hi John.
The Enlarger (507) is wall mounted.
All the alignments have been made with a spirit level and checked with
another.
(I spoke to Oddessy (UK's Supplier of Devere) to find out how they
recommend setting enlargers up, half expecting them to recommend the
Zig align I'd read about in Ctein's book, and they kind of laughed and
said spirit levels was good enough for them etc... )
So first I've got the column vertical, and made sure that once the
head is added the thing is still upright in both directions. Second I
have made sure that over and above the bench, the easel itself is
perfectly level in both directions. Thirdly I levelled the lens, again
width and depth, and fourth the negative plane. Then re-check the
whole lot, and place a heavy 5X4 neg in the glass carrier which I have
scratched with a compass point, in a grid pattern right out to the
corners, and start checking how things look on the base board and
through the focus finder. Starting from wide open things are
definitely not sharp at the corners, so I close down and can see the
improvement quite easily, but beyond F8 the sharpness looses it.
Frustratingly between F5.6 & F8 which is best for the centre, the
corners never get there. The grid projected on to the base board tells
me enough, I can see its not sharp in the corners.
I start to play with the lens alignment, but no luck, as one corner
improves, another rapidly gets worse.
Then the neg alignment... same story.
I Hope I've missed something obvious,
Thanks for taking the time
Scott

Are all four corners equal in quality?  If so, alignment is probably ok.

This is as it should be.  A quality enlarging lens will typically deliver its
best performance 1 to 2 stops closed down.

How are you judging?  From a print?  Using a grain magnifier?  How different is
it when you say "not sharp"?

This suggests that the alignment was ok.

> I Hope I've missed something obvious,
The corners should be SLIGHTLY worse in quality.  It is impossible to design a
lens to have equal quality across the field.  To give just one reason, because
the aperture is tilted, it is smaller and diffraction is worse.  If you can
clearly see lower quality in the corners of a print, something is wrong.  If
the lesser sharpness if seen only with a magnifier, it may be expected.
See www.schneideroptics.com/enlarge/Datasheets/apo-cpn4,0-150/apocpn4-150p2.htm
for the MTF curves for your lens.   Unfortunately they are only for f4 and f11.
The decreased quality in the corners is severe for f4 and small but present for
f11.

You could check for field curvature.  Does the image quality in the corners
improve if you focus for the corners instead of the center?  Field curvature
should be extremely small.  Still, you might get better overall results but
focusing somewhere other than the center of the image.  Also, if refocusing on
the corner doesn't improve the image quality of that one corner, than alignment
cannot be the problem.

My thought on using another enlarger wasn't for coverage but to see if the
lens was sharp corner to corner which would show alignment problems.
 I'm not sure that levels can align enlargers close enough. I'm not sure
about this because I did get sharp images by using a level but had a time of
things in large prints so picked up a SaltHill tool. All of my enlargers
were out! aligning them did improve things but not more than a stops worth
of improvement. . I was not joking about the tension on the screws when
mounting the lens flange. I actually could see the lens alignment change
when they were tightened more on one side than the other. This is why I am
still wondering about the quality of levels used in the alignment. I would
hate to send you in an expensive direction if it was the lens in the first
place. I don't know the price of the alignment tools these days as I bought
mine years ago. I do use it often to check things and probably have saved
enough on paper in a year to pay for one but still after what Barry said am
reluctant to say "ITS ALIGNMENT".
It would seem to me that if it was alignment that you could roll the focus
and watch one side get worse as the other got better. If this happened it
would be alignment for sure. The greatest problem is the film and lens
alignment. This has to be prefect or everything else will fail. The film to
baseboard alignment isn't as important.

Scott,

Suspect the focus finder when used off axis.

Have you printed your scratched grid neg at various apertures ?

Oh, no, horrors.  Kodak is really trying to get rid of us B&W guys.
Can we mount some kind of a united campaign to get some B&W film??
This group ought to have a bunch of people who will want to
protest this.

There is a place for questions/comments on the Kodak website.  I've 
asked if TMX will continue to be available in the 2-sheet Readyload, and 
requested that TMY be added.

  Kodak's policy (and Agfa's, for that matter) of discontinuing products
with low volume reminds me of the definition of the Yiddish word
"Chutzpah": A fellow is brought into court and convicted of killing his
parents. He pleads for mercy because he is an orphan. 
  If either company did any promotion I suspect their sales would increase
significantly. Kodak, Agfa, et.al. may not be loosing money, they are
probablly just not making enough. Bigger is not always better; at some
point, when a business gets large enough, its overhead becomes so large
than it can not make or sell low-volume products. Many years ago I worked
for Hewlett-Packard. -hp- found that it couldn't make small instruments
cheap enough to compete with smaller companies because its paperwork cost
for a sale exceeded the market value for some types of products. I think
around $300 was the lowest price they could sell anything for without
actually loosing money. This was around 1970. When -hp- started making
calculators they had to retail them instead of direct selling to get the
internal selling costs down. 
  I suspect that companies like Kodak and Agfa are so large that they are
inefficient, exactly the opposite of the conventional wisdom.  There is an
optimum size for everything. Insects are very strong but if you built an
ant or a flea the size of a man it would collapse of its own weight.

John - when I click on this link I get a "page cannot be found" message.
When I searched the Kodak web site for "Readyload" I didn't get any relevant
hit. Could you or someone else who successfully got to the site from the
link summarize what ever it is that Kodak has said about Readyload? Thanks.
Brian

  I'm using Eudora; it may have chopped off part of the link or something.

  The gist of it is that two-sheet Readyload film of all kinds are now
discontinued, and single-sheet packs will become available soon. Kodak says
the single-sheet packs will fit the Readyload holder, Polaroid 545 and Fuji
Quickload.
  There'll be a couple of Ektachromes, Portra 160...but conspicuously
absent is TMX.

The URL was probably incomplete, that is to say, the line was broken, when
it came through your email.

Be sure to use the entire

www.kodak.com/global/en/professional/products/films/readyload/readyloadMain.
shtml


(Even if this one above breaks into two lines.)

I put the whole URL in and get the message from KODAK, "this page no longer
exists."  I haven't tried to search the Kodak site further, for the correct
URL, but I don't think this one is it any longer.

  Right. I tried it just now. For some reason, even using "copy" and
highlighting the whole URL the shtml part, which is wrapped in the message,
doesn't transfer to the window in Netscape, so has to be added manually.
Computers are just not as smart as they want us to think.

The current discussion about enlarger enlignment and the diffuclties in
getting a good alignment made me wonder: I now you can correct
converging verticals of say a building by appling the Scheimfplug (sp?)
principle by changing the planes of the lens and the baseboard relative
to the negative.

Are people actually using this method, when aligning the enlarger is so
laborious?

I have a Durst Neonon 80/5.6 and it is significantly
better at printing  35mm negatives than my Leitz
Focomat 50mm/4.5. Rumor has it that the Neonon's were
made by Pentax.
Another enlarger that looks worth considering is the
Kaiser, they have different column heights available,
an auto-focus option that might come within your
budget and have the unusual feature of the diffuser
box sitting above the condensor rather than replacing
it. I have not used the Kaiser myself, some details
are available at http://www.silverprint.co.uk

Mine came fitted with this glass Ed fortunately. I many years ago had a
really excellent Gamer enlarger made in Sherborne, Dorset. It was in many
ways a copy of the Focomat !c, but had two condensers, the bottom one of
which pressed on the negative. It wasn't AN finished, and I had to use all
sorts of devices to stop Newton's Rings. However, it was a really excellent
instrument which I found I could convert to point source, and semi-point
source perfectly. I have searched and searched, but never again been able to
find one (they went out of business years ago). I'd snap one it if I ever
came across one.

Another enlarger that looks worth considering is the
Kaiser, they have different column heights available,
an auto-focus option that might come within your
budget and have the unusual feature of the diffuser
box sitting above the condensor rather than replacing
it. I have not used the Kaiser myself, some details
are available at http://www.silverprint.co.uk

Yes, the Kaiser is a nice enlarger. However, it is not as substantial and
sturdy as the Meopta. Also, I like to have a choice of light source
diffusion OR condenser, not both at the same time, for their different
printing characteristics. The Meopta has both kinds of head (in fact it has
three - colour, an excellent VC, and a condenser head) which can be
interchanged in less than 30 seconds.
Some users of the Kaiser have actually commented that the light output is
TOO great causing unworkably short exposures meaning resorting to ND
filters.
One other drawback of the Meopta is that the colour head units are in the
virtually unused Agfa system. I don't print colour so this doesn't bother
me, but it might if you printed both monochrome and colour. Also, the
excellent VC head is et up for Ilford filtration, which is close enough for
Agfa as well. However, when you get into Fort and other more specialist VC
papers, their filtration is very different from Ilford, and you may find the
Colour head an easier option than the VC. Of course, paper manufacturers
never seem to
quote Agfa filtration, only Kodak or Durst. A pain! I suppose you would just
have to use that modern abomination, split grade printing!
Just a barbed joke you split grade fanatics - I definitely don't want to
open that can of worms again.
I wondered who made the Neonons. In any consumer test, they always seem to
test out well. It's odd that your 80mm outperforms a 50mm for 35mm printing.
That really is unusual. I guess either my Focotar is a especially good one,
or yours is a poor one or has had a knock to displace elements in its long
life, or maybe a combination of both.
Incidentally, there seems to be a general opinion that wider aperture
enlarging lenses are a 'good thing' per se. I use a 6x9 mixing box on my
Meopta regardless of negative format being printed which gives very even
lighting. Even with this, my exposure times for 35mm printing are fine until
I start getting up to 16x20, and for pretty well any 6x6 enlargement using
the f5.6 Neonon at f11. The necessity to work at the single optimum aperture
of F 5.6 of the Apo Rodagon 80mm was a real problem often causing the need
for ND to extend exposure times to a workable level.

I suspect that my Leitz is a sub standard one, it was
only slighly sharper than a four element Jessops lens
and the contrast was slighly less.
Err, any offers for a Boxed Leitz Focomat 50/4.5, I
should have kept quite :-;

The US importer is Freestyle Sales Co. at http://www.freestylesalesco.com

I used to own a Magnifax 4 with colour dichroic head and can vouch for the 
quality and ease of use of the Meopta brand. This is a very high quality 
enlarger that will last you for years! It's a wonderful B+W enlarger 
because the quality of light coming from the diffusion chamber is very 
even. And they supplied chambers for 6x6, 6x7, 6x9 and 35mm together with 
the enlarger I had bought all those years ago so it was a very good value 
indeed.

I believe the standard neg carrier with the Magnifax 4 is a glassed one 
(anti-Newton glass on top) - good because it helps keep you negatives much 
flatter than glassless ones though you need to take more care with regards 
to dirt - and comes with a built in focus device (though you might still 
want to invest in a proper grain focusser).

You might find their enlarging timers less sophisticated than you like 
though. But most standard timer kits are basic and easily replaceable.

Also, make sure a regulated power supply comes with the unit you buy.

I don't think you'd have much problems with spares - Meopta has been around 
for ages and is fairly large brand in Europe. Furthermore, there is very 
little that can go wrong with an enlarger! Maybe you want to buy a spare 
neg carrier at the same time as your new purchase in case you drop one! 
(that's always been my fear with my current enlarger)

The neg carrier that came with my previous enlarger is a variable sizing 
one. To change from one size of neg to another you adjust 4 blades.

It's very true that the Meogon S series are no slouch. I haven't had any 
experience with them but the 50mm Meogon was once tested in a British 
magazine to be better than a 6 element Rodenstock of the same focal length. 
I can't recall what parameters it bettered the Rodenstock in though.

Exactly how much cheaper is the Meogon S 80mm than comparable Rodenstocks 
or Schneiders? If its half the price, I'd try the Meogon. If its cheaper 
only by 20% or so buy the more established brands if you like. When I 
suggested to the local Meopta importer here some time ago to bring in the 
Meogon 50mm (which was about 40% cheaper than the Schneider in the same 
class), it sold out in no time.

Good luck!

Tried Nelson's gold toner last night, and I really like the results.  The 
instructions are to fix a second time after toning, but I gather that this is 
only for hardening and not otherwise necessary.  This is the process 
sequence that I used, can anyone see a problem?

Develop
Stop
Fix  1 min (Ilford Universal Rapid fixer 1:3)
Wash  10 min
Wash aid  5 min  (Heico Permawash)
Wash  15 min
Tone  20 min  (Nelson's gold)
Wash 30 min (or as necessary for fixer removal)
Air dry

Since the toning takes so long, I'd like to use a larger tray and do multiple 
print batches.  Can I mix a second batch of toner and add it to the first?  
Also, I gather that the precipitate should be retained with the toner and 
not filtered out -- true?

TIA

Chris,

The clear toner can be decanted into the tray for use but the precipitate
should not be filtered. Usually a fair amount of yellow-grey "sludge" can be
found at the bottom of the bottle.

One other thing, do not microwave the toner to heat it up as this seems to
kill the toner for subsequent use, at least I think so. I've done this to
two batches and the toner is dead after the first session of toning. Perhaps
I'm wrong but I don't have any other explanation for the toner to quit
working so quickly (as I only toned 4-5 prints in the first session).

Good luck,

Don Bryant

I goofed on developing a roll of Kodak HIE, the developer was far too
old, and the negatives came out extremely flat. Printing through a Grade
5 filter could not bring any snap in the few negs I tried. I gave some
negatives a chromium intensification according to Anschells (12,5 ml 10%
PotDichr, 0,3 ml HCl in 100ml as bleach, wash, re expose and
re-develop).

The resulting neg. came out brown coloured, and did not have any
intensification, they even lost some density when I printed one exactly
the same as before the chromium treatment.

So, did I do something wrong? I bleached for 5 minutes in fresh
solution, but I could still see the image on the negative, although it
was much weaker. I used D19 as redeveloper.

I have tried mercury intensification in the past, this on weak negatives
with surprising results. But this negatives are not weak, but very flat?

Any other options?

Thanks for any feedback,

Cor

Yes!
  This is a common practice and the daily routine of Aerial photo work .
Many enlargers have lens, film plane, and baseboard movements. You usually
have to use small F/stops to get every thing in focus loosing the optimum
sharpness. I worked on a nice setup that had geared movements that were run
by microsensor  that took everything into consideration including focus. --
!.4 million dollars! Worked quite well!
The enlargers that have lens swing like Beseler can do this as you can swing
the lens and move the base board to make a rather large correction......but
if all is square and properly aligned especially the neg and lens you will
be able to get much better resolution at wider f/stops

 The fixing step after toning is necessary because the toner can form a
sort of halide in the process of toning. The second fixing is a precaution
since these toning side products can affect image stability. Wash the
prints after the second fixing bath as for just fixed prints. 

  If you are not heating the toner the toning time can be substantially
shortened by doing so. About 100F is the recommended temperature. 
   More of the gold solution can be added to the toner to extend its life. 
  The precipitate formed when the toner is first mixed is allowed to settle
out so I suspect any later precipitate should also be removed.

You can always elevate one side of the easel to align verticals.

True, but this is only really an issue if you want to set contrast to a
specific "grade" as specified by the paper manufacturers. And since one
mfr's G3 is another's G2, this doesn't really make a lot of sense either.
The beauty of a colour head is stepless control of contrast - start with no
filter at all and get the highlight exposure right, then if necessary dial
in magenta to increase contrast or dial in yellow to reduce it.  VC heads
usually have some ND filtration as well to keep exposure times roughly
constant and while this can help, it's probably true that its effectiveness
will vary with different papers.  Certainly, the "grade" markings are
unlikely to correspond to *all* paper manufacturer's specs.

During our investigations with various heads for Analyser calibration
purposes, we found that for Ilford MG IV the dual Y/M filtration figures
Ilford specify for Kodak-units was more or less a spot on match to the
Ilford filter set on my LPL 7700 colour head.  The Leitz V35 VC head,
however, is wildly different to the Ilford filter set grade for grade; its
grade 0 is much softer than Ilford's 00 for example.  Some insight into
this can be gleaned from my colleague Chris Woodhouse's web site -
http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/ktphotonics

So the answer really is to go with what you've got, and if necessary do
some simple tests to establish whether any adjustments are needed.  I would
personally choose a colour head ( I do print colour from time to time, but
I'm speaking here from a b/w point of view ) because of the individual
control of the filters.  And yes, Meopta are good, solid, no-nonsense
products, and if you don't like their timers then I can help you there ;-)

Nor me, but with respect it's a perfectly sensible alternative method of
controlling overall and local contrast, not an "abomination" :-)

Over in the UK Corona is (or was?) a popular brand of fizzy drink (soda, I
believe to you guys in the US). I don't suppose that is what you are
referring to Tim?

I found it by going to the kodak front page, then going through professional 
products, and found it in one of their 'special' windows on the left. The 
address was right, but you need to make sure to add the .shtml at the end.

It seems that TMX Readyloads have been discontinued.  Got this from 
Kodak Professional:

**********************************************************************

We are also excited about the Kodak Professional Readyload Single 
Sheets. 
At this point the products listed for the new Readyload Single Sheet
Packets are the only ones that will be available in the 4th quarter. Other
products will be considered in the future. 

Thank you for visiting our Kodak web site.  If you should have any

I purchased one of these lenses about a year ago as my MPP has trouble
accommodating a 90mm and I wanted some thing modern and wider than my 120mm.
I have been very pleased with it .Can't give you a scientific response but
for me it gives very sharp images and good coverage for 5 x 4 use. I have
noticed cutoff when using rising front but beleive this may be more to do
with my camera configuration than lens coverage.
Was originally worried about possible light fall off at corners for this
wide a lens (not having experience of very wide angle lenses before) but not
had any printing problems.
Am perfectly willing to expose and develop a negative and post to you if
that will help.
You may like to suggest a subject and I'll do my best to comply.
My e-mail is johnhrhodes@btinternet.com if you want direct contact.
If you do choose to buy get a quote from Robert White in the UK. I obtained
mine from him at about 60% of recommended price.

Regards

JR

Hi!

After moving my Laborator G 139 into my now darkroom, I decided to align
it for the first time. I used a spirit level to adjust the three wheel
bases, until the baseboard was level in both axis. Then I loosend the four
screws holding the head axle, put the spirit level on the negative stage
in left-right direction and turned the whole head until the bubble was
centered.

Then I searched about one hour for an adjustment screw to adjust the
negative stage in the other direction. After a lot of thinking and head
scratching I found the two screws that adjust the small rollers running at
the column and was able to tilt the head.

Then I searched for adjustments of the lens plate. I didn't find any...
the column holding the lens plate was exactly vertical. It is possible to
tilt the lens for +10-20 degrees, but the zero-stop for this adjustment
was correct. Unfortunately, the lens plate isn't completely horizontal; it
falls to the rear. I haven't found any adjustment screws for this. I
loosend the three holding screws round the axle of the lens plate and put
a piece of cardboard on the top between the flange and the chassis. This
worked to a degree. Unfortunately, I can't tilt the lens plate whith the
piece of cardboard in place... does anyone have any ideas how to adjust
this correctly?

I just got off the phone with Kodak a second ago and
I'm hoping to mobilize a force to get them to make
Tmax in the new single shot readyload system. I spoke
to Kevin at 1800-242-2424 ex. 19 and asked him about
the future of B&W in Readyload and his exact words
were "it will be evaluated." I asked him what I could
do and he said "Well, you just put in a vote."

So please, if you ever want to see Kodak make B&W film
in readyloads then call them and let them know that
they have a customer who so desires. I think they are
seriously contemplating eliminating the product.

US government High level surveillance Capable of spotting a 1/2 inch disc at
12,500 feet!
We could align photo's so that measuring any dimension on the print would be
accurate within 2 inches per/mile!
 They used me for top secret clearance over missile bases as I haven't been
in the military and therefore could not identify what I was looking at! :o)
......they claimed I couldn't give away secrets if I didn't know what they
were! I was also considered to be un-brainwashable..... as you can't reveal
what you don't know......pretty good job huh?  { in other words .....get a
dummy civilian large format photographer to do the work!!  :o) }
 Pretty neat stuff - one lens I used cost $186,000 Dollars US { Wild lens
which is now Zeiss } Enlarger ran on a railroad track! { I have no idea of
the make of some equipment.......it was all painted green!  :o)

I did this work 25 years ago and about the only "Project" that I knew of was
one to identify all buildings in the US and to record them for _TAX_
purposes. { yes they did this! } We also photographed most of the Bristol
Bay and southern Arctic ocean and counted the otters, whales, and other sea
life that can be spotted from the air......Got that job hanging around in a
bar in Kodiak ....The_ Mecca Bar_ to be exact since you have probably
stopped in at least once!

My experience too! Do not nuke the toner!! Although I'm at a loss to explain
the reasons....

The original poster asked about toning times and about toning groups of
prints:  The toning times will get longer as the toner ages, slightly
ameliorated with additions of more gold chloride (about 4 mls per 40 8x10's,
more or less), but toning times of 30 minutes are not uncommon, depending on
the printing paper in question.

I usually tone 4-5 prints at a time.  All the prints are face down in the
toner, while the top print is face up (and so awash with chemistry, as
well).  I rock the tray continuously (while it's floating in another tray
filled with hot water, to maintain toner temperature), and every 10-15
seconds (or so) I turn the top print face down on the top of the other
prints, and then take the print on the bottom and turn it face up on the top
stack. Repeating this procedure rotates the prints through the stack and
maintains good contact with the toner.

The only other thing I might add is that I cover the toner tray with
plexiglas - the main benefit of which is to help maintain the toner
temperature at 100-110* (the higher temp tones faster), but it also serves
to minimize exposure to what fumes the toner has (which is pretty minimal).

Good luck.

Jon

The twits strike again - the following is a snippet from another list.
Summary, GYF drops 5x7 format (except for 3000 sheet special order).

" Yes, once again Kodak doesn't get it. Think of all the nice things out
there now like centennial POP paper and Bergger BPF200 film which are
essentially reproductions of discontinued kodak products. And yes, 5x7 is a
great format whose popularity is just now starting to make a comeback, so of
course Kodak will discontinue all 5x7 film. I guess there aren't enough
wedding photographers using 5x7 anymore. "

IDIOTS.  Nuffsaid.

Hi All

Thank you for the input so far on the Meopta/enlarger questions. 
Malcolm is out of town for a few days this week, so I am gathering
information and trying to track down the US distributor for Meopta. I
have e-mailed Freestyle, here is the reply:-
 
------OOOOO-------
Hi Sylvia

The Meopta enlargers are no longer available and will not be in our new
catalog. We do however still have some of the meopta enlarging lenses
available.

Marvin (Marv) Keller

Freestyle Camera
------OOOOO-------
I guess he means that he no longer sells them. 

We already use one of your timers Richard, you may recall you supplied
it with the 110v option some time last year-ish.  We also have your
enlarger exposure meter its great, it saves paper and time for me. 

Thanks again regards Sylvia

Yes, I now wear gloves.  But I've used this toner for quite a number of
years and, at first, I didn't - but never saw any stains.

If something a little more exotic might interest you, I suggest you try a
warm-tone paper like Portriga (or Ilford WTMG, or Fortezo) and experiment
with first selenium toning the print (wear gloves!!) before the NGT.  For
instance, a very light (i.e. barely visible) pre-treatment in selenium
(followed with a thorough clear and wash) will, in my experience, render a
lovely unique palate of spilt-tones.  Other papers will respond differently
(uniquely) and will require experimentation.

Have fun!

Jon

Do you wear gloves?  I understand gold chloride in solution will
permanently stain skin, but don't know if the concentration in NGT
working solution is high enough to do so (and haven't wanted to
experiment).

Great idea.  Thanks for the help.

'Yup, been in the Mecca once or twice - I was back this summer and it is still

to mind the original Keyhole spy satellite program; 'thought you might

  Well....bear in mind that enlarger distributors aren't necessarily
enlarger _users_. Also, at least one manufacturer of high-quality enlargers
states that their enlargers are factory-aligned and therefore don't need
alignment; owners of that brand who do check the alignment just about
universally find that the enlargers aren't aligned.

  My experience with my 4x5 Durst was that while spirit levels indicated
that everything was level, my Versalab Parallel laser alignment tool
indicated that _nothing_ was aligned. Careful test prints of really grainy
negs confirmed that things weren't quite right, but an hour with the
Versalab gizmo and a layer or two of metallic tape in the appropriate
places solved the problem.

  So...while I certainly can't rule out a lens flaw, I think that if your
enlarger has been aligned using only a spirit level it may not really be
aligned enough. Also, I assume you're using a glass neg carrier at least
for the tests.

  The Versalab and Zig-Align tools are somewhat expensive; perhaps you can
find someone to borrow one from or rent it. Also, somewhere on the net I've
seen instructions on how to make your own Zig-Align; maybe an inquiry on
rec.photo.darkroom could turn up that information.

Yes, I do indeed remember!  My use of "you" above was as in "list in
general" :-)  If all else fails, you could try the UK distributor of
Meopta, Roy Knichel at RK Photographic, tel +44 208 349 4568.  I believe he
does ship overseas.

Hello
I have been using a 500mm (2ft) aluminium spirit
level, check it is striaght by looking down the edge.
The spirit level is an I section beam and this makes
it useful for wedging into the bottom surface were the
negative carrier sits. I then use  a piece of 2"
square wood to sit on end of the baseboard on end. I
then mark a pencil line onto the wood, carefully
adjusting my head height so that my line of sight is
parrallel to the edge of the level. I do this for each
end of the level. This gives me accuracy of better
than 1mm along the 500mm level, corrulating to +/-
0.06mm for a 2.25inch negative.
The spirit level can also be held against the bottom
rim of the enlarger lens to check lens to baseboard
alignment, rotaing through 90 degrees to check each
axis.

On my old Meopta Opemus 11a, circa 1965, The column
had sunk at the front edge into the baseboard, an old
credit card provided the perfect shim, sliding it
either closer or further from the centre bolt. The
head is rotatable on a centre screw, the end stop was
also out. Using "feeler guages" (as used to adjust the
spark plug gap for petrol engines) between the end
stop was useful as the head shifts each time the bolt
is tightened.

On the subject of enlarger len's:
At this rate some dealer is going to start to offer
graded hand selected lens. His stock will consist of 5
of this brand lens and 10 of that brand and 6 of some
other brand, dumping the rest onto e-bay.

Nikon enlager lenses made by Hoya according to a
dealer I spoke to, same one that credited Durst
Neopan's to Pentax.


Regards Richard Saunders.

Hi Sylvia

If I remember corectly (too lazy to check back) your other option was
the Durst M70 Modular, I have the M670 with a condenser head, cheaper
than the M70 but basically the same unit I think.  I mostly like the
670 but it has some basic flaws and too much plastic IMO, accessories
are all extras, generally at silly prices and often difficult to
obtain.  Durst seem to have cut cost corners all over the place on
these units, the lens mounting boards are horrible threaded plastic
things unlike the old metal ones, I paid 12 UKP for a plastic ring
from Durst to turn a 39mm board into a 25mm and its so cheaply made it
barely fits.  Extra condensers cost more than a used Meopta!!  Also on
the 670 there is not enough provision to adjust alignment, and
frustratingly no way of adjusting friction on the focuser.  The 70 may
be better, I havent looked at one closely, but check for the above if
you go the Dust way.

Thanks to all for advice and ideas.
Am still sorting the thing out.
I will let you know when I have a resolution to the problem.
I was unable to work on it yesterday, but can clarify that I am
talking about the working aperture (Les). Although now watching the
corners instead of the centre as I stop down I would revise the
optimum aperture down to F8 - F8/11, by which time the centre is
slightly past its best (5.6/8). Perhaps in the light of Michaels
comments below this is a better procedure anyway.
The Neg. is sandwiched between two sheets of glass (John).
I had not thought about suspecting the focus finder off axis (Graham),
but now its been mentioned wonder if anyone else would say the same?
I ask this because it could be that a slight inaccuracy in the spirit
level, and also in the focus finder could be just the ticket for going
right around the bend! Also being a trusting soul with confidence in
the fancy peak focus finder, I have not got to the point of checking
the sharpness in a print... because I could see it was out so there
seemed little point.
Excuse the amalgamation of several responses.
Ever grateful
scott.

Hi.
Time for another replacement. Thankfully this time a little cheaper...
filters.
For large format work I have been using Lee filters for quite some
time now. I need to replace several of them and just wondered if there
was any reason to consider any other brand. Lee filters are resin and
are uncoated. Does this matter?
scott.

I've had a Meopta Magnifax 4 with VC head for a while now, and have never
regretted the purchase. It replaced an old Durst M301 when I needed 6x7
capability. I think it's much than that particular Durst although I can't
speak for other makes or models.

RK Photographic, in the UK, have a Web site, although I'm not sure how
helpful it will be.

Hello,

    I just came back to night from the photokina. I spoke with Agfa people
and they confirmed that are not manufacturing anymore APX 25. They have some
stock for 3 or 4 months;that is it.
    Otherwise the Photokina is now 95% digital and numeric.

excuse if you are on both alt process and pure silver, but wondering if
anyone was going/aware of the SPE conference in Portland OR Oct 6-10,
whether it was worth attending, along with PhotoAmericas 2000.  You can
email offlist.

  I posted this to the darkroom group without result so will try it here.
 In a fit of madness I bought a Morse M-21 at the weekend camera sale, got
it for $20 so couldn't turn it down. The guy threw in an old densitometer
too, I may be looking for information on it later.
  I wonder if anyone has an instruction book for the printer. What I mainly
want to know is how far to inflate the pressure pad, especially if there
was a specified pressure.
  The thing has a wiring diagram inside so there are not many other puzzles.
  For those not familar with these they were made mostly for the military
for printing aerial film. A great many found their way to the surplus
market, plus Morse also sold them on the civilian market. Mine is a 10X10
inch model with 35 argon lamps in it, each with a separate switch. The guy
I got it from managed to break both sheets of glass so I must replace them.
Neither should present a problem, they don't appear to be anything special.
I used a bicycle tire patch kit to fix one small leak at the corner of the
pressure pad. All the argon lamps and the four neon safelight lamps work, a
piece of luck since they are nearly impossible to find.
  Again, if anyone has an instruction book, or simply remembers some
details, I would be glad to hear from you.

I know that a while back we had this discussion, with some disagreement; I
am typing up a sheet on split filter printing, compiled from notes from 6 or
7 different books:  London's Photography, Worobiec/Spence's Beyond
Monochrome, Horenstein's Photography, Rudman's Lith Printing, Ephraum's
Creative Elements, Burchfield's Photography in Focus.Maybe I am dreaming
here that this list can come to some kind of consensus on this topic--in
fact, how foolish to think so if my textbooks differ!  But here goes a try:
    All books agree that split filter printing works.  Not all agree in the
order to do it; most say to use the high contrast filter first.  In fact,
London says if you don't use the 5 filter first you will make the highlights
too dark (?)  I find the latter illogical, as the higher contrast filters
don't do much to the highlights it seems to me.  Burchfield says to do the
low contrast filter first.  Worobiec/Spence say it doesn't matter.
     My questions:  does the order in which you do it truly matter?
      Does split filter printing really make a difference or would a single
filter work fine?  If I remember correctly, Steve, Richard Fateman, and
Barry Thornton all thought split filter printing was bogus?   (see, I cut
and paste info from this list into one big file, but I don't always cut and
paste the individual saying the stuff...)
     And, on a related topic, does the order that you flash paper in
'flashing' matter?
      I could just type out the notes as is, and confuse my students, but it
would be nice if I could simplify the controversy.  I did, BTW, do a test of
my own today:  I printed the neg with the soft filter first and the hard
second, and then opposite, and I can see a slight difference between the
two, the favorite being the first:  printing the print 4 sec at 0 filter and
6 at 5+ vs. printing 5+ first at 6 and 0 then at 4 sec.
Whew, was that lengthy!
Chris

Christina,

One more thing to muddy the water for you. It is not necessary to use the
softest and hardest filters or settings available to do split filtered
printing. Usually I find that maximum yellow filtration is too soft.

I don't split filter print much anyway since I use a dichro head but I do
use a mixture of magenta and yellow filtration in most ever print. I can
tweak the print with as little as a 5cc change with one or both colors.

But I'm normally not a believer in split filtered technique except in
certain cases which are usually very high contrast negatives or ones with
dense highlights. It really depends on what your printing goals are if you
want to use this technique or not. It is something that should be used but I
really wouldn't introduce students to this concept and technique because it
can be used as a "crutch" more than a creative tool.

My 2 cents worth.

Just don't tell them that they need to use seperate fixers bottles for
processing IR film. :-)

Don Bryant

Chris,  I will use multiple contrast filters during the printing process  when
it will make a better print than from a single grade.  I think many would agree
that selectively adding a specific contrast grade to a specific area(s) is the
best use for multi grade printing.  I rarely use just one filter/grade to make a
print if I'm using multi grade paper, unless it is for a newspaper ad or some
other quick "disposable" purpose.

Are you also making a sheet for graded paper printing?

You didn't mention the paper/enlarger/developer combination that you used to run
your test.

No it isn't bogus.  While it's fair to say that a straight print made with
split filter exposures can be matched by one made through an equivalent
single grade filter, the point about split printing is that it allows
dodging and burning of the shadows and highlights separately, thereby
affording local contrast control.  That is its biggest advantage over
printing through a single grade filter. 

Another advantage is that if you posess a basic enlarger without a colour
or VC head, split grade printing will allow you to fine tune contrast.
Standard Multigrade filters allow control to half a grade - split filter
printing allows stepless control right from softest to hardest by varying
the ratio of the exposures.  If I may be permitted a short commercial, our
StopClock Professional can calculate the ratio of the two exposures and
display the equivalent "grade" to within a tenth, and the Heiland
SplitGrade controller will measure negative contrast and control the print
contrast accordingly, again to within a tenth of a grade.

In most cases the order of the exposures doesn't matter very much, but when
determining the actual exposures I find that with soft negs it's better to
start with the hard exposure, and with hard negs to start with the soft.
The second exposure then "fine tunes" the highlights or shadows respectively.

As with most printing techniques there are nuances, but that's the basic
principle. Hope this helps!

Regards
Richard

Good morning.
Split grading does work and is valid. Some may think it a fad, some
may use it as a crutch. I do not think it is so much a question of
dividing a basic exposure between two grades to make an exposure at
THE grade, but  more the chance once the basic exposure and grade have
been found to take the image one step further in refining the look of
a print. It can make possible the impossible. Admittedly it can be
misused and misunderstood. But the possibility of printing one
negative at different grades on one piece of paper is such an obvious
bonus that whilst some may choose not to use the technique, to dismiss
it seems ridiculous. To be able to print areas at chosen grades, be
they higher or lower, within one print simply opens more creative
possibilities.
Surely split grading is no more or less valid than selectively
pre/post flashing for example. It is just another tool.
As to whether the progression of exposures should proceed from hard to
soft, or soft to hard, I can not see that it matters so long as the
sequence of final print exposures follows the same pattern as your
test print exposures.
For me the only down side of the technique, is that in my indecisive
moments, there are seemingly more decisions to make... but that's just
me!!

Hi Chris - First, you have to define what you mean by "split printing." In
the previous discussion, some were using the term to mean making your basic
exposure with two different filters and two separate exposures, e.g. the
first exposure high contrast, the second low contrast (or vice versa). I
think a consensus was reached to the effect that this accomplishes nothing
that a single filter couldn't accomplish. See Phil Davis' article in a late
1994 (I think that was the year) of "Photo Techniques" (under the previous
name of that magazine), in which he pretty well proved this.

People who think there is an advantage to this method of working sometimes
are operating under a misconception to the effect that variable contrast
paper has two separate layers, a blue layer and a green layer, and that when
you use a high contrast filter you expose  only the blue layer and when you
use a low contrast filter you expose only the green layer.  If this were the
case, there might be some advantage to split printing in the sense I'm using
it here. However, that isn't how variable contrast papers work. Both
"layers" are sensitive to both kinds of light, only in different
proportions. So when you expose with a high contrast filter you aren't
exposing only the shadows and when you expose with a low contrast filter you
aren't exposing only the highlights or midtones. You're exposing all of the
tones in the negative, only in different proportions with different filters.
Since both types of filters (high and low contrast) expose both types of
emulsions (which in fact aren't coated on the paper in layers but rather are
all mixed up together), there obviously is always some combination of single
filter and exposure time that will produce the same result as two exposures
with two different filters for different times.

OTOH, if you use "split filtration" to mean making a base exposure and then
burning in with a different contrast filter, as some were using it in the
previous discussion on this topic, I think everyone would agree that this is
advantageous and indeed the ability to do this is probably the single best
reason for using variable contrast papers rather than graded.

Finally, despite the fact that they are gaining no advantage, some people
have gotten used to printing with split filtration (using the term in the
first way) and if it works for them, that's fine, no reason to change it.
and I wouldn't suggest that they should. Whatever works etc. etc.  My only
quarrel comes when people who do this claim that they are producing prints
with this method that couldn't be produced any other way.

Don,
    I sat there for a while wondering what the heck this meant, and then
laughed out loud; you have a memory of an elephant!  I assume (correct me?)
you are referring to errors about infrared photography in a certain book
that I was defending about a year ago, hmmmm?  Well, at least that, or was
it you, introduced me to the pure silver and infra lists so here we are a
year later and much the wiser!

I'm not so sure I'm that much wiser but I am more informed. BTW, I would
like to see your book one of these days.

Thanks very much for your input on Meopta enlargers.  So what are you
suggesting here about the lens situation please ?

Hi Eric!!
     Missed your presence at the Formulary this year...  TA'ed for Gordon
Hutchings which was wonderful, but I guess that is off-topic..

> Are you also making a sheet for graded paper printing?

No...should I?  Never use graded papers, always multigrades, either Ilford
or Agfa MCC 118.   would also never suggest to students to use graded papers
so I guess it is moot.
>
> You didn't mention the paper/enlarger/developer combination that you used
to run
> your test.

paper was Ilford Multigrade IV RC (test examples for class, normally never
use except for contact sheets); condenser enlarger, dektol developer.
>
> EJ Neilsen

I hope to read this all tonight and reply, but heading to MN for four days.
I copied all info from the posts heretofore and am bringing them into school
today to discuss with other teachers (some of whom are not aware of this
technique, some who poo poo it).  Will definitely get Phil Davis' article so
thanx, Chuck, for the cite.
     However, I may not be alive after teaching 42 kids back to back how to
process film all at once, in gang lab today.  Did it last monday for the
first time (new teacher that I am) and I felt I had strep throat when I was
done (yes class, timing your development time IS actually crucial, yes
class, did you agitate?  No??  Do you realize you HAVE to agitate???)  I was
substitute teaching for another lab whose teacher was absent.  Of course
they weren't MY students (another off topic convo here--MY student yesterday
was processing photograms and thought the water was fix and so he didn't fix
any of his prints and they were such a pretty pink I almost felt bad telling
him to redo...)

The only thing that matters is that the images look good. Other than that,
who really cares whether you print using split filters or Love Potion #9?

If it helps, or you think it helps, and your results are excellent, then you
are doing something right.

Have had hours of fun with enlarger, and its alignment, as per
messages through the last week.
I now feel more confident that the enlarger is set up properly, as
with a focus finder, the four corners appear to be equal in their
quality, which is a little less sharp than the centre. THANK YOU ALL
FOR YOUR HELP.
However... I am still not sure I am getting what I should, or what I
want from such an expensive lens. But putting the lens to one side for
a while, I wonder if the enlarger itself could be causing the problem.
It is a DeVerre 507 with a colour head, which has two fans cooling its
two bulbs. They are causing a slight vibration (and are noisy), which
I can feel if I place the ends of my finger nails on the casting that
supports the neg carrier. It would seem logical to replace the fans...
Unless this is normal? Any Ideas?

Richard,

The best source for instruction books in the UK is Oldtimer cameras. I don't 
know if they will have anything on this but here is their web site URL and

Hope this is of some help.

Have never heard of either the Zig-align or Versalab parallel laser device.
Could someone explain them in more detail and intimate costs and
availability please.

Barry- the Maplin bar code reader is no longer available and pen lasers are
about 80 so one of the above may help.

Regards

JR

This can definitely cause sharpness problems.
The easiest solution is to attach the top of the enlarger column to wall 
and/or ceiling using braces or cables with turn buckles.
The trickier solution is to use flexible tubing to move the fans from the 
enlarger head to a remote shelf on the wall-if this is at all possible 
with your enlarger.

'Got my resealable anti-static bags from Static Specialists today (see the
CC above for their email address).  The 5x8 metal in bag fits a 4x5 film
holder *perfectly*.  About $20 shipped to my doorstep in 1 week.  Very nice -
hopefully this will further alleviate any dust problems associated w/static
during te winter months...

Oh, their Phone # is 631-218-0590 / Ask fro Dolores Cooper / mention you
heard about it here on pure-silver.

Cheers,

Thanks Russ.
The enlarger is wall mounted.
I can see that taking the fans out of the head would solve the
problem.
But would just getting new fans do the trick?
As they get older, could they set up such a vibration?
Has anyone else had such an experience?

Scott,

I have the same enlarger (DeVere 5x7) and the fans are absolutely vibration 
free. They make some noise, but you can balance an egg on the enlarger head 
and it wouldn't fall.

So, I guess I would recommend replacing the fans. Not sure if they're a 
standard size  voltage, etc. or you have to go to Odyssey...

  The Parallel is a small box that contains a low-power laser aimed upward.
You put a piece of glass (supplied microscope slides) in the neg carrier or
on the lens; when those surfaces are in alignment the laser dot is
reflected directly back down to its source. When they're not aligned, the
laser dot is reflected off-target.

Good luck...didn't help with Ektalure paper so don't hold your 
breath.  Besides, shouldn't you use a good film instead of just a 
convenient one?

I missed being there, but it appears that they needed more students to justify
such a luxury as myself.

I can't imagine not recommending graded paper.  There are times that a graded
paper will give you perfect match to your negative.  I would guess that if you
don't plan on recommending a graded paper that split developing will not be
offered up either.  ( using a low contrast developer such as Ansco 120/ then
using a higher contrast developer such as Ansco 130).  Since multi grade paper
tones quite differently than graded paper this should be an area to explore or
at least let your students know about.

Did you run multiple test or just one?  I would expect to see some change in
prints unless several are made to allow for any changes in temp/voltage/etc..

Another possible source of something similar would be
http://www.digikey.com their part no is SCP167-ND
for a 5X8 static shield ziplock bag -- their listed prices
are 25 for $5.13, 100 for $18.45.  I believe the bag
manufacturer is 3M.  You can view a PDF of the relevant page
of their catalog at: http://rocky.digikey.com/USCatalog/V3/518.PDF
I don't know what their shipping costs are.  No affiliation
with or interest in the company.  At my day job, we
frequently get small Q's of various items from them.

Readyloads are convenient, true, but I also think that
TMX is an excellent film. I think the combination is a
good one. Have you had bad experiences with TMX, what
don't you like about it?

I dunno, but I have both a 14" RD Artar and a 19" APO Artar remounted into
new Copal #3 shutters by Steve Grimes - these are superb optically, at least
for B&W - I never shoot color so have no idea how they do there, though they
should be fine...

 Thank you so much for the referral. I will check it out. The book is not
urgent, I've figured out most of what I need, but it would be nice to have.
Several people have responded via e-mail, with mainly moral support and one
(Windancing) with several photos of his printer. The community of internet
photographers is really exceptionally generous.

  Yes. John was my first stop, Petra Keller my second. The book is not
ugent, its just something I would like to have. I've been doing business
with John Craig for several years ever since meeting him at one of the
local camera shows. He's a good guy. He suffered a major tragedy a couple
of years ago when his daughter was killed by a drunk driver.
  Petra Keller, BTW, is a good source of new photo books including some of
the more obscure ones. http://www.camerabooks.com

  A bit of a puzzle. Its a Red Dot but the normal 12" Artar is f/9 not
f/10. The barrel is also a little different. It does not have the threaded
section on the font (normally with a cover) for a reversing prism. The
normal barrel mount also has a slot for Waterhous stops or special filters. 
  Goerz built lots of special lenses in small numbers. I don't know what
other changes this lens might have or where to find out. 
  Its possible that Art Kramer might know. I havent seen any posts from him
for some time and wonder if he is OK. Art worked for Goerz at one time.

Hi Sylvia !
Have you tried the original Czeck web site ( http://www.meopta.cz )
There is a page for buying online ... I've never tried this. 
You can also go to RK Photographic in Finchley (near London) they have a
web site, and are 
very helpful (I've bougt an Opemus from them)
The site is http://www.meoptauk.demon.co.uk 
Best regards !

Georges

Thank you for the URLs.  Yes, we had seen these two Web-sites and plan
to compare prices this weekend.  Malcolm (my other half) has already had
a conversation with RK Photographic, who seem to be very helpful.  The
initial reaction, without doing the maths, is that RK Photographic
prices look very similar to the online Czeck costs so we are probably
going to send out son who lives in the UK down to RK Photographic to
take a look for us.

Regards
Sylvia

Chris,

    Few weeks ago there was a big "fight" on the list about the utility of
split printing. I do not want to come back in to this but just make some
comments. I have started using split printing 6 months ago after 20 years of
B and W darkroom. I have found the technique very useful and reliable but it
is purely personal and it could not work for others.
    from a teaching point of view I believe it could be very useful for
students and I will explain briefly why taking an example :
    let assume you have first determined the right time with filter 5 for
the blackest shadows for example 8 sec then you run a series of test strips
quipping 8sec constant a series like 1 strip with 2s for filter 00 then
4s,8s,16s,32s,64s.Each test strip will correspond to a grade from 5 to 00.
The students could easily  see the effect of going from grade 5 to 00.
Otherwise it will give precious data on the time you will have to burn the
hightlights with filter 00.I prefer to start first with filter 5 but it is
also personal. When I have roughly found the good time for filter 00 I
usually have to decrease a little the initial time for filter 5.Then I print
a sample with all the dodging and burning I want and write the data on back.
Next day I carefully look at this print and start the final printing.

    Daniel

alexis,

It's approx 12:1 for perhaps something like 2-3 minutes (with the Portgiga,
anyway).  But the real issue is not how much for how long, but the final
effect judged *visually.*

As you now, a weaker solution for a longer duration will render the same
results as a stronger solution for a shorter time - so the thing to cue into
here is the "barley visible results" of the selenium toner in advance of
treatment in the NGT.

Hope this helps -

Jon

Christina,

I teach in Colleges throughout the UK  and have found that the majority of the students produce a much improved standard in their black and white prints when I have taught them split grade printing. Some have difficulty in understanding the concept but with a little one on one with them usually resolves the problems. My approach is to lay the hard filtration on top of the soft and do believe that there is a difference when the hard filtration is given the first exposure. I have no wish to get into further discussion after the long thread of some weeks ago so I will not give my reasons. Might I suggest that you test it and decide for yourself which is your preferred method.

I would also get your students to use graded papers for they do offer a number of differences from VC paper.

I know that a while back we had this discussion, with some disagreement; I
am typing up a sheet on split filter printing, compiled from notes from 6 or
7 different books:  London's Photography, Worobiec/Spence's Beyond
Monochrome, Horenstein's Photography, Rudman's Lith Printing, Ephraum's
Creative Elements, Burchfield's Photography in Focus.Maybe I am dreaming
here that this list can come to some kind of consensus on this topic--in
fact, how foolish to think so if my textbooks differ!  But here goes a try:
    All books agree that split filter printing works.  Not all agree in the
order to do it; most say to use the high contrast filter first.  In fact,
London says if you don't use the 5 filter first you will make the highlights
too dark (?)  I find the latter illogical, as the higher contrast filters
don't do much to the highlights it seems to me.  Burchfield says to do the
low contrast filter first.  Worobiec/Spence say it doesn't matter.
     My questions:  does the order in which you do it truly matter?
      Does split filter printing really make a difference or would a single
filter work fine?  If I remember correctly, Steve, Richard Fateman, and
Barry Thornton all thought split filter printing was bogus?   (see, I cut
and paste info from this list into one big file, but I don't always cut and
paste the individual saying the stuff...)
     And, on a related topic, does the order that you flash paper in
'flashing' matter?
      I could just type out the notes as is, and confuse my students, but it
would be nice if I could simplify the controversy.  I did, BTW, do a test of
my own today:  I printed the neg with the soft filter first and the hard
second, and then opposite, and I can see a slight difference between the
two, the favorite being the first:  printing the print 4 sec at 0 filter and
6 at 5+ vs. printing 5+ first at 6 and 0 then at 4 sec.
Whew, was that lengthy!

Adding to Les' comments below:  I shall interject, for he's been accurately
concise.

resolves the problems. My approach is to lay the hard filtration on top of
the soft and do believe that there is a difference when the hard filtration
is given the first exposure.

When the hard filtration is laid down first, the soft exposure tends to
lessen the intensity/density of the shadow areas.  Details arise when the
soft layer is added on top of the hard.  Additionally, selectol soft then
decktol or split development adds tothis seperation.  It's great.

I have no wish to get into further discussion after the long thread of some
weeks ago so I will not give my reasons. Might I suggest that you test it
and decide for yourself which is your preferred method.

The preferred method depends on whether the intention is to bring up
highlight detail and lessen the contrast range, with soft thenhard expsoure;
or to bring up shadow detail as with hard then soft exposure.


> I would also get your students to use graded papers for they do offer a

If student's learn their using a grade 3 light more often than a two or
split grade exposure, they owe themselves a justice on print on graded
papers.  It becomes easier to be consistent and to burn-in or dodge back
areas.  Pick the longest time and dodge back the shadow detail; or flash
burn in the areas that need more time then give the over all time onto
graded papers.

All too often, the grade choice is made to make darker prints, and they
sacrifice detail; but the word contrast should be the expression 'contrast
range' for the range can be shortened with more light and shorter
development or extended but with darker shadow detail with extended times or
warmer developer on grade 1 paper.

Subject: RE: split filter printing

Adding to Les' comments below:  I shall interject, for he's been accurately
concise.

> Christina,
>
> I teach in Colleges throughout the UK  and have found that the majority of
the students produce a much improved standard in their black and white
prints when I have taught them split grade printing. Some have difficulty in
understanding the concept but with a little one on one with them usually
resolves the problems. My approach is to lay the hard filtration on top of
the soft and do believe that there is a difference when the hard filtration
is given the first exposure.

When the hard filtration is laid down first, the soft exposure tends to
lessen the intensity/density of the shadow areas.  Details arise when the
soft layer is added on top of the hard.  Additionally, selectol soft then
decktol or split development adds tothis seperation.  It's great.

I have no wish to get into further discussion after the long thread of some
weeks ago so I will not give my reasons. Might I suggest that you test it
and decide for yourself which is your preferred method.
>

The preferred method depends on whether the intention is to bring up
highlight detail and lessen the contrast range, with soft thenhard expsoure;
or to bring up shadow detail as with hard then soft exposure.


> I would also get your students to use graded papers for they do offer a
number of differences from VC paper.
>

If student's learn their using a grade 3 light more often than a two or
split grade exposure, they owe themselves a justice on print on graded
papers.  It becomes easier to be consistent and to burn-in or dodge back
areas.  Pick the longest time and dodge back the shadow detail; or flash
burn in the areas that need more time then give the over all time onto
graded papers.

All too often, the grade choice is made to make darker prints, and they
sacrifice detail; but the word contrast should be the expression 'contrast
range' for the range can be shortened with more light and shorter
development or extended but with darker shadow detail with extended times or
warmer developer on grade 1 paper.

Hello,

    I got from the Photokina trip a sample of the Bergger 200 film for 120.
The problem is that I have no idea for developer and time. The emulsion is
identical to the BPF 200 sheet film. Does any one as some suggestion about
the developer and time? For example in D76 or Xtol?

Thank you very much. The English site has some data on Bergger products 
which are not on the French version. It is funny.

Thanks for your e-mail.  It looks very likely that we are about to place
an order for a Meopta MAGNIFAX but did check out your suggestion of a
beseler 45.  Am I wrong or is this a rather large beast?  Our darkroom
is not very big.

The issue isn't whether "split printing) (using the term to mean making two
separate exposures of the entire negative, one with a high contrast filter
and one with a low contrast filter) "works." It certainly does "work" in the
sense that it can be done. It is, however, somewhat more time and trouble to
make two exposures with two different filters rather than making a single
exposure with one filter. So the question is whether it accomplishes
anything that couldn't be accomplished equally well by making a single
exposure with a single filter.

Perhaps I've misunderstood your message but I gather that you (and Les) are
suggesting that there is some advantage to be gained with this method of
printing as opposed to making a single exposure. After reading Phil Davis'
article previously cited on this topic, it seemed clear to me that there is
no advantage to this method of printing and that it's just a waste of time
and effort. I haven't seen any messages  that point out the perceived
fallacies in Mr. Davis' thinking and testing, all of which are fully
illustrated in his article so that readers can draw their own conclusions.
So rather than simply asserting that it is a technique that can't be
duplicated with a single exposure/filter (if in fact that is what you, Les,
or anyone else are asserting), without giving any explanation of why this is
so, perhaps you or someone else who shares this belief could explain  the
fallacies in Mr. Davis' conclusions. That way we could weigh the two
positions and form our own conclusions. As it is, Mr. Davis is the only one
who explains the basis for his conclusions and backs them up with testing,
so it's kind of hard to disagree with him.

I have three of the books  to which you refer in your message - Rudman,
Horenstein (you don't specify which Horenstein book but I think I have them
all),  and Ephraums. I don't offhand recall any suggestion in any of them
that there is some unique benefit to be gained by making two exposures with
two filters for two different times as opposed to one exposure with one
filter. Rather than just referring to the books by title, could you provide
us with the relevant page numbers on which these claims are made?

I should perhaps add once again that: (1) "split printing" in the sense I am
using it and in which Mr. Davis used it means making two exposures  of the
entire negative with  two different filters for different times (usually).
I'm not talking about burning in sleeted areas of the print with a different
contrast filter(s) than was used for the basic print, a technique that all
agree is very useful, and (2) if anyone is using "split printing" and likes
it and finds it useful, that's fine - I wouldn't suggest that anyone change
anything that works for them.

The issue isn't whether "split printing) (using the term to mean making two
separate exposures of the entire negative, one with a high contrast filter
and one with a low contrast filter) "works." It certainly does "work" in the
sense that it can be done. It is, however, somewhat more time and trouble to
make two exposures with two different filters rather than making a single
exposure with one filter. So the question is whether it accomplishes
anything that couldn't be accomplished equally well by making a single
exposure with a single filter.

Perhaps I've misunderstood your message but I gather that you (and Les) are
suggesting that there is some advantage to be gained with this method of
printing as opposed to making a single exposure. After reading Phil Davis'
article previously cited on this topic, it seemed clear to me that there is
no advantage to this method of printing and that it's just a waste of time
and effort. I haven't seen any messages  that point out the perceived
fallacies in Mr. Davis' thinking and testing, all of which are fully
illustrated in his article so that readers can draw their own conclusions.
So rather than simply asserting that it is a technique that can't be
duplicated with a single exposure/filter (if in fact that is what you, Les,
or anyone else are asserting), without giving any explanation of why this is
so, perhaps you or someone else who shares this belief could explain  the
fallacies in Mr. Davis' conclusions. That way we could weigh the two
positions and form our own conclusions. As it is, Mr. Davis is the only one
who explains the basis for his conclusions and backs them up with testing,
so it's kind of hard to disagree with him.

I have three of the books  to which you refer in your message - Rudman,
Horenstein (you don't specify which Horenstein book but I think I have them
all),  and Ephraums. I don't offhand recall any suggestion in any of them
that there is some unique benefit to be gained by making two exposures with
two filters for two different times as opposed to one exposure with one
filter. Rather than just referring to the books by title, could you provide
us with the relevant page numbers on which these claims are made?

I should perhaps add once again that: (1) "split printing" in the sense I am
using it and in which Mr. Davis used it means making two exposures  of the
entire negative with  two different filters for different times (usually).
I'm not talking about burning in sleeted areas of the print with a different
contrast filter(s) than was used for the basic print, a technique that all
agree is very useful, and (2) if anyone is using "split printing" and likes
it and finds it useful, that's fine - I wouldn't suggest that anyone change
anything that works for them.

Catching up after a week away from the list, I found the comments on
enlarging lenses interesting. Graham is right; a grain magnifier is no
substitute for carrying out some simple practical tests.  With the help of
my friends who kindly augmented my collection of 35mm enlarging lenses, I
set about testing a number of optics that included Dallmeyer, Leitz, Meopta,
Minolta, Nikon, Schneider and Zenith (the one supplied with the portable
enlarger).

My test negative was a piece of microfiche of very fine print held in a
glass carrier diagonally across the frame. Alongside this in the other half
of the frame was placed a piece of grain screen. With the enlarger set for
12" x 16" prints the results were revealing.  All were tested at full
aperture and down to f8, with the test strip laid from the centre to the
corner of the easel. Predictably the results at full aperture varied, but
the "best" names did not always give the best result. Then on stopping down
things began to even out, and at f8 there was really nothing between them in
terms of sharpness. So it seems that f8 is a great leveller! It is pointless
me giving you my results because lens performance will vary within a given
make and specification. Suffice to say, for the Meopta enthusiasts who have
commented on the list, my particular Meopta lens performed extremely well.
And the worst performance was put up by a most illustrious name!

 The second test, was for contrast, and I used a method that I think was
first described by George Wakefield in the AP some years ago. A small plated
washer was placed on the glass carrier, and its image focussed to the same
degree of enlargement as before. A test strip on grade 2 was made to
determine the D-max. The printing paper was then placed on the easel and a
cheese shaped segment covered by the corner of a black card. The D-max
exposure was given and the print developed normally.  A high contrast
flair-free lens should show a pure white image of the washer matching the
white segment covered by the black card.  This was not the case with most of
the lenses tested; the flair producing varying amounts of light grey
fringing within the image of the washer.   This is a pretty demanding test,
and of course a slight lack of contrast can be corrected by adjusting paper
grades. Interestingly the worst performer in this test (an old Dallmeyer)
was amongst the sharpest in the previous test.

 Hope you find this relevant; it certainly supports what others have said
about testing before buying. It also supports using your own experience
rather than that of someone who has been fortunate in buying a good sample
:-)

Clifford.

me giving you my results because lens performance will vary within a given
make and specification. Suffice to say, for the Meopta enthusiasts who have
commented on the list, my particular Meopta lens performed extremely well.
And the worst performance was put up by a most illustrious name!

 The second test, was for contrast, and I used a method that I think was
first described by George Wakefield in the AP some years ago. A small plated
washer was placed on the glass carrier, and its image focussed to the same
degree of enlargement as before. A test strip on grade 2 was made to
determine the D-max. The printing paper was then placed on the easel and a
cheese shaped segment covered by the corner of a black card. The D-max
exposure was given and the print developed normally.  A high contrast
flair-free lens should show a pure white image of the washer matching the
white segment covered by the black card.  This was not the case with most of
the lenses tested; the flair producing varying amounts of light grey
fringing within the image of the washer.   This is a pretty demanding test,
and of course a slight lack of contrast can be corrected by adjusting paper
grades. Interestingly the worst performer in this test (an old Dallmeyer)
was amongst the sharpest in the previous test.

 Hope you find this relevant; it certainly supports what others have said
about testing before buying. It also supports using your own experience
rather than that of someone who has been fortunate in buying a good sample

Catching up after a week away from the list, I found the comments on
enlarging lenses interesting. Graham is right; a grain magnifier is no
substitute for carrying out some simple practical tests.  With the help of
my friends who kindly augmented my collection of 35mm enlarging lenses, I
set about testing a number of optics that included Dallmeyer, Leitz, Meopta,
Minolta, Nikon, Schneider and Zenith (the one supplied with the portable
enlarger).



My test negative was a piece of microfiche of very fine print held in a
glass carrier diagonally across the frame. Alongside this in the other half
of the frame was placed a piece of grain screen. With the enlarger set for
12" x 16" prints the results were revealing.  All were tested at full
aperture and down to f8, with the test strip laid from the centre to the
corner of the easel. Predictably the results at full aperture varied, but
the "best" names did not always give the best result. Then on stopping down
things began to even out, and at f8 there was really nothing between them in
terms of sharpness. So it seems that f8 is a great leveller! It is pointless
me giving you my results because lens performance will vary within a given
make and specification. Suffice to say, for the Meopta enthusiasts who have

  Somewhere along the way, perhaps in a conversation on compurserve, Phil
suggested that perhaps what gave the appearance of different results from
split-filter printing was that maybe the prints were closer to the
"correct" contrast and exposure, sort of as an artifact of the process,
than was being achieved by single-filter printing.
  He wrote that I was probably engaging in "wishful seeing." <G>

They are 26 x 32 inches baseboard dimension and if fully raised will be 48
inches tall.
I guess for 120 size film they would be large!
 Mine is beside my 8x10 enlarger - Base board 72 x 58 inches and 12 feet
tall - it weighs 3/4 ton so the Beseler is not that big to me!  :o)
   Good luck on the darkroom. I spent my college days in a 4 foot x 6 foot
darkroom so know that great prints can easily be made in smaller darkrooms.
One of my friends has his whole darkroom in a 4 x4 foot closet and uses
drums to process the film and paper - he uses the bathtub for holding the
Jobo processor. He does 8x10 camera work and up to 20 x24 inch prints and
has excellent results. I would be careful of HYPE from and lens or camera
manufactures as I have worn out 6 hassy systems and also worked with some of
the most expensive equipment ever made. There was a "slight" difference
between the $186,000 US dollar lens and a regular Schneider CompononS but
you had to look very close! I learned that the tripod was the most important
part of sharpness. Also contrast of lenses and sharpness of lenses is a
dance at best. You almost always loose a tiny bit of resolution when you
increase contrast in lenses so watch out for hype in this area. Slight
increases in development time will equal out contrast differences in your
lenses.....In other words some of the older less snappy Hassy lenses are
just as good as the newer ones that have the Fuji coatings. { No one admits
the connection to Fuji but all modern lenses are basically Fuji coated , T*
lenses for instance}. A slight increase in your development will take care
of the diff. The enlarging lenses are much the same with some of the
Japanese glass or modern coated lenses appearing to give much better
results........just not so! Adjusting your dev time will again take care of
the diff.
 I was a devoted user of diffusion type enlargers and swore that they gave
better results than condenser enlargers. Richard K that posts on this group
sometimes convinced me to try changing development of negs to match the same
contrast in both types and ....oops there was no difference I could see or
that my densitometer could read. The diffusion was better on dust though!
  I hope you folks have a great time in the darkroom! You can produce equal
results to the megabuck equipment with good technique and the fun is in the
doing. From the questions you ask you will be among the best when you get
the "bugs" worked out of your system.
  If I can ever be of help let me know.
  Good Light
Chuck
