This is not to be recommended. Hypo eliminator will break down all the 
residual thiosulphates in the paper through oxidation, producing soluble 
sodium or ammonium sulphates.

1. The total removal of  all thiosulphate is probably not desirable.

2. The high alkalinity of hypo eliminator can lead to the production of small 
gas bubbles ( especially after an acid fixer) which can cause damage to the 
base and emulsion. This level of alkalinity can also result in excessive 
swelling of the gelatine.

3. Peroxide used in the formula can also oxidise silver and may have a 
bleaching effect on the image.

I just got back from a hugh Edward Weston exhibit at the Museum of Fine
Arts in Boston, MA.  It was great, but I'll try to narrow my reaction to
a few technical questions (list etiquette, you know.)
http://www.boston.com/mfa/weston/gallery.shtml
1) Many of the prints are labeled "Platinum or palladium print."  Does
this mean that at this late date we can't tell which is which?
2) I wasn't blown away by the print quality, although I was expecting to
be.  I'm wondering if we have optical brighteners in our papers today
that actually give us a greater tonal range than the "old masters," such
as Weston?
	Thanks for any insights you may have.

 Platinum and Paladium are very close in appearance. I suppose a chemical
analysis could tell the difference but at the expense of damaging the print.
  I saw a large exhibition of Weston's work at the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art a few years ago. There were a fair number of platinum prints
made early on by Weston before he gave up on pictorialism. They are quite
different from the style of image most people associate with him. 
  The exhibition I saw did not always make clear whether the silver-gelatin
prints were Weston originals or reprints by Brett Weston or someone else.
Many were pristine and made me wonder about their actual age.
  The optical brighteners used in modern papers work by flourescing under
UV light. When the light source does not contain much UV the brighteners
make little or no difference. Since the type of illumination used for
photographic exhibitions typically have a minimum of UV (for conservation
reasons) I doubt that they would account for differences in the prints. 
  Platinum is a rather low constast medium. The platinum image generally
does not reach nearly the maximum density of silver-gelatin and the
sensitive material is coated directly on the paper so there is not highly
reflective layer benieth the image as with conventional paper. The "long
scale" of platinum is partially due to its low contrast and partially due
to the stretching of the shadows because of the self-masking effects
typical of many printing out processes.
  In the exhibit I saw some of the images were just stunning technically.
Whether these were Weston's own prints or someone elses later prints I
don't know.
  Having seen a great many original prints by other photographers,
including Ansel Adams, I came to the colclusion that all too often really
good ink on paper reproductions were as good and sometimes better than the
original prints. Not so with Weston. Even the best reproductions miss a
little something.

  A PS, someone posted to the Photo History list today that Gesela Freund
had died at 91. She is not as well known IMHO as she should be. The obit
was from the NY Times, I haven't checked their web site to see if its there
as well as in the print edition. The Associated Press seems to have missed
it altogether.

Thank you so much for posting that. It caused me to do a search of the
Minneapolis FA Museum page and I found out that some EW prints will be on
display this July. Yeeeeaaaaa, I'm finally going to see some Weston's in
person! I've been waiting many years for this....Well, gotta get back to
the darkroom so that I'm only *almost* humiliated to death when I see them.

As I have not seen any reports about Delta 400 and PMK Pyro, I would like to 
share some recent experience, from both 120 and 120 formats.

I have used a JOBO CPP2 and JOBO 1500 tank as follows:
1: PMK mixed 5+10+500, I fill approx.  500 ml in the tank. I develop for 13 
minutes @ 70 F (21.1C) at high speed (#2), only one film in the tank.
2: 1 minute stop bath (plain water) at high speed (#2).
3: 5 minutes Hypam fix 1+4 at high speed (#2).
4: Afterbath, used developer for 4 minutes at low speed (#1).
5: Wash, 5 cycles each 5 minutes with 250-270 ml of water at high speeed (#2)
6: Final wash , AGFA Agepon diluted 1+200 in VOLVIC mineral water  for 1 
minute, full tank standing upright,open lid,  no agitation except for a few 
twists of the spiral- I use this for all films in order to avoid any drying 
stains.

I have increased the recommended after bath time from 2 to 4 minutes in order 
to get more stain.

I have not made any tests of  plus or minus development.

I have found that a setting of EI 250 is quite optimal for me. I can print 
most negatives quite acceptable on unfiltered VC paper, where I get a very 
nice grey scale as well as very sharp details.

The grain is more visible than with the same film developed in XTOL 1+2  
which is another good alternative for Delta 400.

I've just finished a box of 5x4 type 55, using my 'new' MPP Mk7,
learning the mechanics and optics.  I now feel competent enough
to continue seriously.

Some questions please.

1    Should I give a water wash first, to remove as much 'gunk' as =
possible?

2    What is the capacity of the 20% Sodium sulphite bath?
    i.e. How many negatives can be put through say a 1 litre bath or
    should I use a fresh bath for each negative?

3    I've read several accounts of after-treatment, all from reputable =
souces,
     involving wash/ fix/ harden/ selenium  in several combinations.
    Any more ideas?

4    What 'hardware' is required?  At the moment I'm using dip and dunk,
    for my single sheets; but now I'd like some ideas for batch =
processing.

Thanks.  Robert Slater.   rfslater@waitrose.com

The print quality of the Westons at the Boston MFA I found to be excellent,
both the platinum-era and silver-gelatin prints. They were of course all
contact prints, and the reconstruction of his simple darkroom was
enlightening as well -- especially in contrast to the nearby picture of
Ansel Adams's darkroom, which probably has more in common with the darkrooms
of readers of this list. The development of Weston's vision and his courage
to sharpen it I found to be more clearly evident at this show than at others
I have seen, or seen in the popular books, and also evident was the decline
in that vision as he aged and the effects of his illness began to take a
toll. The display of contextual art also illuminated for me the excitement
that must have surrounded his changes in vision and that of his
contemporaries with whom he was in touch. The portraits remain stunning, and
the nudes as well.
One result of my seeing the show is I have begun to work with Azo.

Is Azo what made Weston so good? I think if he were here, he could switch
to something else and still make most of us look bad. I dont doubt that his
original prints are absolutely stunning (I'll find out this summer) or that
he had total mastery of the printing process, but I think he worked a lot
of his magic even before the printing stage. IMO. In other words, even if
we all learned to print EXACTLY like him, most of our prints would still
suck in comparison. ;-) But we do need all the help we can get, so it
doesnt hurt to try everything including Azo. I've got a box right here too.

You allude to his declining vision below. I seriously doubt that his
mastery of printing declined with age, though it became physically more
difficult and then impossible. It was something else that was declining
(assuming that we agree his last work was inferior, which I'm sure not all
of us would. I know I dont care as much for his 1946-48 B&W work that I've
seen, but he  was doing a lot of color work then too, some of which was
pretty decent).

Hi Wayne,
I don't know if Weston used Azo... it's been around a long time, but I am
just introducing myself to real contact printing (4x5). At the Boston MFA
show I attended a talk by Andy Grundberg, who was photography critic for the
NY Times and something of a Weston scholar. The presentation he did
diminshed Weston somewhat in my view, putting him into context with some of
his contemporaries and showing some of the daring work they did, Cunningham,
Walker Evans, for example, and it seems as though the startling and unique
clarity of Weston's earlier work faded somewhat as he appeared to be
influenced by some of them. I doubt that was Grundberg's intention, just
what I took away from his talk.

This is small stuff, though, Weston's images were and are inspiring (to the
extent they are not discouraging)

The reconstruction of his tiny darkroom, with the hanging clear bulb over
the printing frame, with a 14-inch Commercial Ektar on the table, with some
homemade dodging tools, with formulas for developer scratched on the wall
and a few procelain trays suggest what a genius can do with simple tools. I
don't think it was Azo, I think it was him.

I hope some if the prints I saw will be on display in Minneapolis this
summer. Be sure to review it.

bh

I will. Unfortunately I dont think a wide variety of his prints will be on
display. The exhibit is called "Body Work" and I expect it will be mostly
or all nudes. Of course he had some fantastic nudes, but I'd rather see a
variety of his work when I have the chance. I'm quite sure I wont be
disappointed though. I think EW did use Azo but not to the exclusion of all
else, and whether its the same Azo as today's Azo is a matter of doubt.

On a related subject, I used to find Brett's work pale in comparison to his
fathers. However I've lately come around and now I really love Brett's
work. Now, sometimes I think he was even his father's equal. Depending on
my mood, sometimes I even think he....oh, I better not say it. ;-)

RE comments fromWayne re Edward Weston exhibition especially about hus
status amongst his contempories " diminished ".No artistic or scientitic
practice exists in isolation, but is part of the general culture not only of
its own time but of all that has gone before. Progress is a baton passing
process. Even Mozart could not have written what he did if Bach and Handel
had not written what they did and they derived from their predecessors  -
and contemporaries.The general ideas climate influences all interested in
those ideas, many scientific brains converged on the problem of quantum
theory and while history records some, often for their superior showmanship
,the entire culture provided the impetus. 
       So with, Weston he probably was " first among equals" but the ideas
and influences would bounce from one to another. If you get all your ideas
from one place its called plagerism, if you get get them from different
places its called research.

For recent exhibits at the MFA, one has to purchase tickets in advance for a
specific day and time. Is that the case for the Weston exhibit?

thanks!!!

Due to the limited space in my darkroom I have taken to processing my
11x14 prints in tubes, on a Beseler roller base.  Are there any special
precautions I should take?  I have noticed that my developer (Ilford)
seems to have oxidized after only processing 4 prints.  It turned a murky 
gray...
What about my stop and fix, can they suffer the same fate?

Chris

Couple of things
1. A water bath is essential,
      Add a little extra amount of chemistry, if it's not enough the print 
develops    unevenly! I f you're reusing the chemistry, I always discard at 
least 25% of the used chemistry and replace it with fresh before using it for 
the second time.    I never go more than three times with the same used 
chemistry, more than    that, can give you a color shift.  The fixer can    
last much longer, but I     discard it too.
2. Make certain that the table is perfectly level, the tube has a tendancy to 
shift to one side if it isn't level
3. Be certain ALL of the component parts are thoroughly cleaned before 
    you process your next print The Besler Tudbe has the two "V" shaped 
grooves which hold your paper in place, be sure to run hot water over them to 
remove any residual fixbleach....
4. the 94 degree Temperature is not as important as a consistent    
temperature as long as it within reason
5. The shelf life of the chemistry is MUCH greater than what's recommended,     
as  long as it remains in tightly sealed bottles and go unopened.  I mix 10     
liters of chemistry in 10- 1 liter bottles, which seem to do very well. 
good luck,
Mel

Thanks for the reply Mel!  I guess I should have mentioned I'm using the 
tubes with B&W paper and chemistry.  Both Ilford.  The tube is level, 
ambient temp in the darkroom is 68 and therefor I don't use a water bath.

Regards,

Chris

Thank you to all who responded to my question about single weight paper
print processing. I am comfortable now that my technique was basically
sound, but I am taking the emphasis on testing to heart and will incorporate
that. The suggestion of a water holding bath between the two fixes was
especially ingenious and may help me manage fixing times better. I may even
try the beet juice test. I have never tried toning prints, and the response
has encouraged me to try that as well.
Your generosity is appreciated.

I have been told to really watch over fixing fiber paper....to ONLY fix the 
absolute MINIMUM amount of time.  Thus a double fix would over fix and the 
paper would really soak up a lot which would be quite difficult to wash out.

In a few days, my first enlarger will arrive.  I have been shooting b/w for
awhile and just waiting for the perfect opportunity to purchase one.

Couple of weekends past, went to a photography event in Houston called
fotofest.  One b/w photographer's images had some sort of texture on the
background of his images.  I've contacted the individual, he didn't want to
disclose any secrets.  So how does one add texture to the background.  Also,
I would like to hear your secrets if you care to divulge

Photofest is great! Did you participate in "The Meeting Place"?- 
photographers showing their work to a hundred or so gallery owners museum 
curators and art critics?
That really thickens your skin!

Please clarify what you mean. If you hold the print and reflect light off 
the surface do you see a rougher texture on the background areas and 
smooth gloss over the main subject areas?
Or are you saying that within the image  the photographer had stripped in 
a different background with photoshop or had projected a light pattern 
etc...?

you go first... ; )

It was a glossy print.  In the out of focus areas of the image, it wasn't
your normal circles (boken), they had a texture to them, kind of smeared.

Hi folks,

I am a new subscriber to this forum,

The 'texture' John writes about is almost certainly produced by one of two
methods. With both methods testing is advised. With single lens reflex
cameras the effects can be previewed well on the focussing screen.

Method 1:

I think this is the most likely to give the effect seen. If you attach some
strips of thin black card across an old UV filter, this will cause the out
of focus area to streak.  The card strips can be straight or wavy dependent
upon the effect desired. This only works with longer focal lengths. Standard
focal lengths may be OK on medium format and above but wide angles are
usually a 'no-no'. Lenses need to be used at between wide open and about
f5.6 or f6.3. Experimentation is definitely needed here.

An interesting point is that the resultant streaks happen at right angles to
the position on the filter. So for vertical streaks the strips need to be
placed horizontally etc.

Method 2

If you take a piece of thin black card and cut a shaped hole into it, then
place it in front of the lens to act as a 'Waterhouse stop" the out of focus
highlights will assume the shape of the hole. The side of the card nearest
the lens needs to be shaded or flare will result.

In my earlier days as a portrait photographer (I specialise in location
portraiture) I was guilty of making portraits with this effect. For instance
I cut a heart shaped hole for romantic studies of couples or for some of my
Jewish clients the Star of David. I now feel that was a tacky phase I went
through. However if you cut a wavy hole the effect can be interesting. You
must remember to use the lens wide open. Longer focal lengths work best wide
angles are worst. Some experimentation with the size of hole and distance
from the lens is necessary, I found an equivalent area of about f5.6/f6.3
worked well. Providing it is used with a single lens reflex the results can
be observed in the viewfinder.

Its a long time since I used these techniques but I don't think I have left
anything important out.

Best wishes to all,

Ron Turner

Something I should have said last night.  I really first noticed the 
background texture in the whites, for example clouds or a building.  There was 
a definite pattern sort of wavy.  I really didn't notice it on the subject.  
I'm thinking he used something like saran wrap over his enlarging lens, then 
exposed the paper.

I'll de-lurk for a moment to relate something that I remember reading in a
book about spies operating in the late forties or fifties.  It seems that
one gentleman cut the logo out of a Leica lens cap and surreptitiously
photographed super secret stuff through it producing images with little
"Leica" shaped out of focus highlights.

Another possibility is to place a piece of glass above the printing paper 
during exposure and smear vaseline over the parts you want diffused or 
distorted. I suppose to distort the glass would have to be against the 
paper and the vaseline thick and gloppy - to diffuse elevate the glass 
and thin out the vaseline

What you describe makes me more certain it was using black strips across the
lens. I find it very doubtful that the effect could be done in printing
unless digital imaging were used. By the way although I suggested using a UV
filter strips could be stretched in front of the lens barrel without the use
of a filter. Try it it does work well.

If you can find one of the books by Jack Curtis, either "Behind the Camera" 
or  "Beyond the Camera"  
    One of them gives you the theory behind the effects you are talking about 
and examples.  You can get many different effects depending on how and what 
you use for the catalyst.

I hope this helps you get the effects you desire.

Does the list have any recommendations for a compact high quality enlarger for
the 35 mm format?  Black & white only, as I am colorblind.

Years ago - late 60s - I printed in a closet in Ethiopia with the enlarger on
a footlocker. Print washing was tough due to the shortage of water.  I now
have lots of water in Florida, but have, alas, the same kind of darkroom, the
bath.  As a result, the enlarger will need to be taken down.

Any thoughts?  The lure of hypo fumes is strong.

If you can find one, a Voigtlander ZETT.  A nifty piece, folds into a unit
about the size of a pint Thermos bottle.  Great lens, too, typical of the
real Voigtlander ability to make superb optics.

Hard to find but cheap when you do.  Any unit you get will probably need
rewiring but, what the hey!, a hardware store is your friend for all sorts
of things.

Hi folks,

I am a new subscriber to this forum,

The 'texture' John writes about is almost certainly produced by one of two
methods. With both methods testing is advised. With single lens reflex
cameras the effects can be previewed well on the focussing screen.

Method 1:

I think this is the most likely to give the effect seen. If you attach some
strips of thin black card across an old UV filter, this will cause the out
of focus area to streak.  The card strips can be straight or wavy dependent
upon the effect desired. This only works with longer focal lengths. Standard
focal lengths may be OK on medium format and above but wide angles are
usually a 'no-no'. Lenses need to be used at between wide open and about
f5.6 or f6.3. Experimentation is definitely needed here.

An interesting point is that the resultant streaks happen at right angles to
the position on the filter. So for vertical streaks the strips need to be
placed horizontally etc.

Method 2

If you take a piece of thin black card and cut a shaped hole into it, then
place it in front of the lens to act as a 'Waterhouse stop" the out of focus
highlights will assume the shape of the hole. The side of the card nearest
the lens needs to be shaded or flare will result.

In my earlier days as a portrait photographer (I specialise in location
portraiture) I was guilty of making portraits with this effect. For instance
I cut a heart shaped hole for romantic studies of couples or for some of my
Jewish clients the Star of David. I now feel that was a tacky phase I went
through. However if you cut a wavy hole the effect can be interesting. You
must remember to use the lens wide open. Longer focal lengths work best wide
angles are worst. Some experimentation with the size of hole and distance
from the lens is necessary, I found an equivalent area of about f5.6/f6.3
worked well. Providing it is used with a single lens reflex the results can
be observed in the viewfinder.

Its a long time since I used these techniques but I don't think I have left
anything important out.

Best wishes to all,

Ron Turner

Over in the UK we used to have imported Russian autofocus enlargers called
Zenith. They were designed to be portable and packed down in a moment into a
small case a little bigger than an attach case. The case itself was the
base board when the unit was erected. The four element f4.5 lens that came
with the unit was an excellent contrasty performer, and the autofocus really
did work well up to about 12x10 if my memory serves me right. You could turn
the head around for bigger sizes.
It wasn't pretty, but it was a substantial well-made unit, unlike some of
the more recent plastic knock-down enlargers. There are lots of them still
around in the UK and they regularly crop up in 'used equipment for sale'
lists.
Other than that, the best unit I ever used when I had a period of temporary
abode and had to use a tiny WC (cloakroom to you US guys) as a quick
conversion darkroom, was a Durst M300. It's negative holder worked like the
unsurpassed Leitz Focomat 1c with the bottom condenser pressing down on the
top of the negative. It is made from good metal castings throughout, but was
smaller than the successor M301. I took the column mounting bracket off the
baseboard and mounted it on the wall using a shelf bracket, with the top of
the column gripped in what we in the UK call a Terry clip also mounted on
the wall. The baseboard was a piece of plywood placed across the narrow
space from wall-to-wall on small battens (cleats in the US?) screwed to the
wall. By having pairs of battens at varying distances up and down the wall,
I could raise or drop the baseboard to get up to really big prints which I
processed in trays stacked vertically on shelves mounted with similar
battens on the wall behind me.
My son still uses this M300 which gives really bright even light and has a
special built-in focusing device which is accurate, but unfortunately uses
colours to achieve this.

Years ago - late 60s - I printed in a closet in Ethiopia with the enlarger
on
a footlocker. Print washing was tough due to the shortage of water.  I now
have lots of water in Florida, but have, alas, the same kind of darkroom,
the
bath.  As a result, the enlarger will need to be taken down.

Any thoughts?  The lure of hypo fumes is strong.

I normally use Ilford fixer for both prints and film.  But, I was unable to 
get Ilford yesterday so I picked up some Kodak Rapid Fixer.  Normally, 
(with the Ilford fixer and DW fiber base paper) I fix for 1 min in each of 
to baths.  The Kodak information states to fix for 3 to 5 min in each 
bath.  This will result in a total (max) time of 10 min.  This seems 
extreme.  The Kodak is more diluted (in the working strength) that the 
Ilford but 10 min...  Also I don't want to harden the prints.  I assume it 
is safe to just leave the hardener out and use water for the volume the 
hardener would have used.

Any thoughts?

  You can leave out the hardener. Dilute the fixer to "film" strength and
use the Ilford times. The normal Kodak dilution gives times similar to
conventional fixer. Its meant to avoid problems from bleaching due to
excessive fixing times. Not really a problem but some people dump prints
into the fixing bath and just leave them. 
  Acutally, most paper emulsions will fix out completely in less than five
minutes in fresh sodium thiosulfate fixer. The ten minute time often seen
is a large fudge factor to account for partially exhausted fixer and for
poor fixing technique, such as fixing a lot of prints simultaneously
without agitation.
  For prermanence you should use a two-bath fixing system. Fix for half the
total time in each of two baths. The fixing process is not a simple
reaction, it goes in about three steps. Until its completed the reaction
products are not fully water soluable and will persist in the emulsion
regardless of the extent of washing. By using two baths the second remains
relatively fresh. The first bath does most of the work, the second insures
the fixing reactions are completed so that the reaction products will wash
out.
  Using two baths also extends the capacity of the fixing bath by about
four to ten times, so it is a real economy. Ilford gives the capacity of a
single fixing bath as only about ten 8x10 prints if the results are to be
permanent. A two bath arrangement extends this to at least forty prints per
liter.
  Full details are in the _Kodak Black-and-White Darkroom Dataguide_ and
elswhere.

Thanks Richard...  I'll do just that, fix for 1 min in each of two baths at 
film strength.  The Ilford fix I had was just 2 months old, but appears to 
have gone off.  At least I think it's the fix (prints are fogging) I'll 
know for sure in about 1/2 hour.  I checked everything else (except the 
fix) until now...

Thanks again for your help,


Chris

  Fixing baths don't have a particularly long lifetime. Given long enough
the thiosulfate will decompose leaving a cloud of elemental sulfur which
eventually precipitates. 
  Kodak gives a life of two months for stock rapid fixer in a closed
container and a week in a tray. Kodak's numbers are conservative so if you
stay within them you are safe. 
  Eventually, the thiosulfate will oxidize and decompose. When fixer is old
enough it can get cloudy, often that is elemental sulfur, which will
eventually precipitate. Fixer should be tossed long before that.
  Working darkroom chemistry should be considered expendible. A very few
chemicals have extended lives. Acetic acid for stop baths will last
practically forever but a mixed stop bath has a life of a few days.
Photo-Flo stock also has a long life, but not forever.
  Old chemistry causes a plethora of troubles. Its cheaper in the long run
to use fresh chemistry and avoid the angst and wasted film and paper caused
by old or exhausted stuff.

Ilfords recommendation when using Hypam fixer at 1+4 ( film strength), is to 
fix for one minute in a single bath with constant agitation. This is followed 
by a 5 minute wash, followed by 10 minutes in a wash aid and a final wash of  
5 minutes.

Each of the above steps should be carried out at 20'C.

It is important that this fixing time is not exceeded, over fixation at this 
strength will have a marked effect on the thiosulphate content of the 
finished print. Fixing for one minute in each of two baths at this strength 
would in effect double the recommended time.

For archival permanence it is recommended that the silver level of the fixer 
is not taken beyond 0.5g/l. (10 8x10 prints or their equivalent.) Fixer used 
up 0.5g/l could be kept for later use with films or RC paper up to a 
recommended level for "comercial" permanence of 2g/l silver.

On the capacity of fixing baths. Many figures are quoted in terms of numbers 
of 10x8 prints per litre of fixer, these should be treated with some caution. 
Bearing in mind that high key prints or those with large white borders, will 
deposit significantly more silver into the fixer than dark prints with no 
borders.

 However, 30 seconds in each of two baths comes out the same. Ilford's own
numbers on silver content of fixers indicates no more than 10 8x10 prints
per liter can be fixed if complete fixation is to be had. The importance of
complete fixing can not be over stressed. If fixing is not complete no
amount of washing will remove the fixing reaction products.
  I have the paper by Mason, Gent, and Parsons(1) on which the Ilford
method is based. I am not completely convinced by it. For one thing there
does not seem to have been any investigaton of the rate at which
thiosulfate adsorbed to the paper fibers migrates into the the emulsion. It
would have to migrate through the Baryta layer. The Baryta layer itself
tends to hold thiosulfate ions.  There is also no indication that
accelerated aging tests were performed to see if the Ilford procedure
actually resulted in longer image life. Given the issue of slow migration
of thiosulfate from the paper base to the emulsion its possible that
accelerated aging tests would not be valid.
  The whole issue of how to process conventional B&W materials for maximum
lifetime is in a rather confusing state at present. There are many
questions, particularly about fixing and washing procedures and about
toning procedures. 
  FWIW, the maximum permanence of a B&W image is gotten by _fully_ toning
it is either a sulfide toner or in a Selenium toner. The shortcoming of
Selenium is only when a very slight toning is produced. Selenium "split
tones" toning the dense areas first and the lighter areas afterward. When
prints are toned in a 1:20 solution of KRST for a few minutes the
highlights are not toned enough to protect them. Fully toned prints are as
stable as sulfide toned ones.

Richard:
    My question is FWIW, do we really need to make the images as archival as
possible?  How many of us are out there selling important images?  While I
realize that we all would like our images to last past our lifetimes, but, I
have prints that I made in college on Agfa Brovira FB that may or not be A.
washed properly or B. not toned or C. a combination of A and B.  They still
look fine, at least to my eye and how they looked when I printed them as I
best remember.   I am concerned that the prints, that are for sale in
galleries, last (with a smile on my face) at least until I draw my last
breath.  I won't have portfolios left for my son to print like Ed Weston.
It is just not in the cards.  I am not advocating sloppy process, in fact,
quite the opposite.  The concern should be on making the image and then
printing the image as best we can.
As usual,
Lee Carmichael

I wish to add a few comments to Richand's et.al. on the subject of processing.  

First, the chemistry is CHEAP and is not worth the effort to pinch pennies!
This is clearly obvious if you consider the cost of the exposed film vs the
cost of the chemisrty.  The chemistry is trivial.  As an example, I ran a
few rough cost calculations on what I would charge a client (I am my own
client on this one) for a photo shoot that I went on in Southeastern Kansas.  

Travel 100 mi at $0.30/mi               $30.00
Location Time 3 hr  @ $30.00/hr    $90.00
10 8x10 film @ $2.00/sheet             $20.00
Total                                               $140.00  or $14.00 per
sheet of exposed film

Chemisty cost to process one sheet -500 mL  PMK pyro ($25.00/50L)= $0.25,
Fixer (Ilford rapid fix $18.36/25L and 50% of 48 sheet/L capacity)= $0.03,
for a total chemistry cost, including wash water, of about $0.30 per sheet
of film. About 2 percent of the costs invested in  exposing the negative.
My darkroom time was not included in the calculation.

To echo what I have previously posted in regards to fixing and washing - the
process that each one of us adopts is not important as long as it is
reproducable and gives the results desired.  To find out if the process is
working properly, TEST.  Again for fixing procedures and capacity, there are
test kits available to check  if the fixer is properly removing the residual
silver in the film or print.  Are the fixing procedures and times OK and has
the capacity of the fixer been exceeded?  Once a working procedure has been
established, stick with it unless there is good reason to change.  If the
chemistry is old or questionable, pitch it and start with fresh.  You are
not saving any money using questionable materials especially when you look
at what you have invested in time and materials for making a negative or a
print from that perfect negative.

I feel everyone of my prints is important (others may disagree :  ).  But I 
must feel that way to put in and get out 100%.  Besides after paying for 
equipment, film, chemicals and paper whats a little extra for selenium toner.

'Tis I who wish to but in here, and explain the archival problem of
longivity was uncovered at one point by a museum conservitor (spelling?=
Curator) who realized that after a period of time, all silver emulsion
'prints,' and I suppose we're talking about negatives with Lee Carmichael,
here; need a 'polish'not too different than silverware for table service.

The chemical is naptha, for oil paintings; but for silver prints I don't
know.  I don't know if this would help with the vitality of negatives,
either.

A friend has 4X5 negatives from his wife's childhood portraits done by
Edward Weston, and they're still printable.  He's got negs fromJohan
Hagermeyer, too; also reprintable without nothin' unusual.

It were the negatives of Arnold Genthe, I add for deviation, that Ansel
asked permission from the DeYoung curators to reprint, because his prints
were so awful.  Then, he discovered Genthe used Pancryptol in the green,
sometimes the red and sometimes the yellow and they all had stains,
unorthidox discoloration that had to be printed with an understanding and
modern materials no one had in that day and time of photography.

What's the question is upkeep for silver negatives and maintenence of silver
gelatin prints to retain that "college age sparkle.''

With insurance, and all costs factored in, I have a hard time with thirty
cents a mile. I have a VW diesel that gets near 50mpg & it still costs when
all is figured in, including maintenance, depreciation(though that has gone
by the board now), etc.

How is that possible? Since the silver grain are suspended within a gelatinous medium and not subject to
oxygen? An if it was to tarnish, what would be the point of "buffing it"?

Well, first, $0.30 a mile is the going commercial rate in the US for
mileage charges.

Secondly, I own and drive an '84 Audi 4000S.  Repair and maintenance bills
for 1999 totalled $375, and I averaged 28 mpg, with premium gas then
costing around $1.20 a gallon.   Insurance cost me $500 or so for the year.
 Taxes and licencing were $40.00.  And I put 40,000 miles on the vehicle
last year.  Comes out to around 6 1/2 cents a mile.  (Oh, the purchase
price was a Leica IIIC K, so, let's say $2,200 -- and I've put 100,000
miles on her since I bought her, so that might add an additional 2 cents or
so a mile.  But, the total is certainly less than 10 cents a mile, actual
cost, to operate.

I think that most people would add-in a bit for depreciation of the vehicle.  
It won't last forever.

Fine.  I'm up to 10 cents a mile.  Add in another 10 cents (!) a mile for
depreciation, if you wish, but, to be fair, you then have to DEDUCT the
benefit I gain for tax purposes by being able to write this off at 30 cents
a mile when I use the car for business use.

Any way you deal with it, it still costs me FAR below 30 cents a mile to
run Clytemnestra.

My wife and I recently decided to get our cats fixed (now that
they're developed). I think they'll have to shave them to expose the
negative traits they've grown.

BTW: know what a cat says when you take it in the bathroom? STOP
BATH! STOP BATH! STOP BATH!

and while I'm on a roll, does acetic acid have to be blessed by the
rebbe?

Hello, All,
I'm a newbie and so far a lurker.  My B&W experience was fairly extensive
but ended about 20 years ago.  I plan to have a darkroom in the new house we
will build later this year.  Two comments on toning for archival quality.
1) I used Selenium toning on my best work not just to make my prints
archival but because I liked the colder tone it provided.  Use it for too
long, and the prints turn purple!
2) I have one print I *wish* I'd toned.  I've had it on display in my
sunroom for several years and it's gotten more and more brown.  It looks a
little like it was Sepia toned, but it's actually being degraded by the
sunlight.  Probably still had some fixer left in it.
Back then, I used Tri-X souped in HC110, 1:31.  Straight out of Fred
Picker's _Zone Six Workshop_.  Boy, was it beautiful!  I printed on Ilfobrom
(paper-paper, not RC), and developed the prints in Dektol.  I used a cold
light head.  I'd appreciate ideas if there's someone who knows these
materials and has found something better in the last 20 years.  Otherwise, I
plan to pick up exactly where I left off.
Regards,
John Pendley

Tidbit from the John Sexton b/w printing workshop, a most worthwhile 
experience completed last week:

Silver in gelatin can tarnish.  If unprotected, and examined under the 
microscope, the silver grains have "hairy arms" with a large surface area 
ideal for chemical reactions.  Toning in selenium seems to make the grains 
smoother, reducing the available area and converting some silver to silver 
selenide , which is more resistant to atmosphere pollution.

 From visual side-by-side comparisons with several types, Selenium toner 
extends the blackness of all papers--a lot.

As I mentioned a few minutes ago, I took a workshop from John Sexton, in 
his darkroom.  Now __that's__ a darkroom.  About 50 ft long by 10 ft wide, 
and almost big enough.

Like you I built a house around the darkroom (some tell me) but I made the 
mistake of not going far enough:  too little room for the sink, no floor 
drain, not enough switched power outlets, etc.
Do read Ansel Adam's "The Print" for some hints on plumbing, shelves, 
drying racks, etc.

Go for it.

Try a large 4x4, twice yearly tire change at $700 per set (plus 2 spares at
another $350), heavy duty winch, upkeep, fuel, depreciation, insurance, etc.

By the time everything is figured in, the vehicle is expensive. But, with
70% of our area as dirt & back roads, clay, mud, gravel & some only by 4x4,
anything else means no travel during certain times of the year. One
advantage is the ability to go on location in almost any weather, including
driving off road and around blockades, etc., when needed.

Garry,

All I can do is quote what was discussed verbally at our Center for
Photographic Arts in Carmel regarding EW's prints and earlier examples of
Silver Gelatin prints some curators have had 'cleaned' but not to be
mistaken with a buffing process as with tableware.

The silver does have a tendency to 'tarnish'and take on a dull look after
some 75+ years and maybe earlier, known to those who chart every look into
their files and not the exact day of any change.

Much of EWs prints have 'foxed' from lack of proper clearing; and some of
that vintage required some ... the other cleaning, to restore their original
vibrance.

Steve Shapiro

Government reembursement was $.22225 per mile in 1986, so $.30 doens't seem
to far off.

But, keeping to old tried and true formulas, consider the 'Paper Products'
Manufactures'Formula' at retail for 5 times cost of materilas.

Take one 8X10 color transparency, for example.

Film cost of $400 per box of 50 is $8 per piece and processing at $4.25US
makes it $12.25 then, times five includes your transportation, equipment
depreciation et. al.

So within an hour, photographing a rock band, outside on stage, gives me
time to get there, set up and make four exposures a $300+ day.

Need more details?

On a slightly different tack, but maybe retaled to the same topic... does
anyone know of or remember a type of wax polish that was applied to fibre
prints. I remember this being used by a photographer friend in London in the
late 1970s (I use the term "friend" guardedly... he wooed a favourite
girlfriend of mine and married her! Grrrr!)... however, he was from
Mendocino and I remember him applying a wax "polish" to his fibre prints
with a cotton ball and then buffing it up with a soft cloth. Was this a
protection or glazing remedy?

I remember doing the same thing about 25 to 30 years (gulp) ago Ed. It was
not uncommon practice then, both to cover retouching marks and to give a
little more of that 'wet print' depth to the blacks - remember that there
was no commercial selenium toner in the UK at that time to increase our
Dmax. Kodak did not export KRST here until the early '70s if my memory
serves. In fact it was hard to find out much about it in terms of what it
was supposed to do and how to use it. I well remember making my own from Se
powder etc in order to find out what it did as all the American 'masters'
used it and so I figured it had to be good, - but when I used it I was
surprised that it didn't seem to do much, little realising at the time
exactly why, as I was printing on bromide paper!

Back to the polish - it was in fact just that. I used to use neutral shoe
polish as it was this that I was shown by others who used this 'technique'.
I cringe at the thought of doing such a thing to a photographic print these
days, but considerations of archival permanence didn't seem to be so much to
the fore then - or maybe it was just that I was inexperienced in such
things. Amazingly however my 'polished' prints of those days still show no
sign of deterioration despite single bath fixing and no toning. Perhaps wax
polish is an archival treatment as well. Now there's a thought!

Dan, quit buying those cheesy Firestones and Wranglers ;-) You'll replace
them every time you change your oil. Get some Wild Country radials with the
extra 1/4 inch tread. I get at least 80-100,000 miles out of a set, and the
only time I replace them is when the treads are worn through (like now,
with about 85K on this set and thats only because I've never rotated
them!). I've never had a flat otherwise, in over 300,000 miles on them. One
time my 4x was stolen, and kids took it for a joyride. They tried to
repeatedly punch it through a spot 1/2 foot narrower than the truck,
between a large fence post and a huge boulder, neither of which budged.
Punch,punch, punch, punch, until it got stuck between the two with the
front tires half peeled off the rims. Put a little air in them and they
were fine!

I've used them on several long backcountry photo trips in the SW (to get
back on photography here) on some of the worst roads known to man. You wont
need two spares. You wont need one.

I've used the Renaissance Wax sold by  Light Impressions. Prints from 10 
years ago show no signs of aging.
It's a great treatment for photos on display in humid conditions and you  
can have a "glass-less" show of your photos at a gallery. It seems to 
make the blacks darker and richer in  the photo- the opposite of a 
plastic coating on the base paper of a photo-----a kind of anti RC paper?

Ed,
I have used Renaissance Wax, deeloped by the British Museum as the final
coating  for aprint. It helps toprotect teh surface of he prints and
ingerprints buff off. I guy I was in graduate school with worked for the
Smithsonian in Washington Dc and said it was what they used on many of
thier photographs. It will also deepen the blacks slightly. I am not a
scientitst but he said it wouldn't hurt th eprint and probably was good for
it giving it a protective caoting. I have used it on silver gelatin and
platinum prints.

I recall that Paul Strand used to varnish his prints as the final step
in processing.  Exactly what he used, I don't know. --Phil

Is the wax applied before mounting?  Does it survive in a dry mount 
press?

If applied after mounting, how would one keep it off the mount board?

Tim and Ed
I'm guilty too. I used Mansion furniture polish at the time, and it did give
deeper blacks. I suppose it is theoretically possible that that the wax
surface 'seal' would exclude oxygen, or other gases from the silver of the
image and thus prevent tarnishing.
At the time I had easy access to a rotary drum glazer, but found by far the
best and easy glaze on fibre prints came from a polymer solution I used to
buy from Eric Fishwick in Lancashire, since most regrettably closed. This
was smeared over the face of a wet, washed, print which was then placed on a
cheap heated flat bed glazer. After few minutes, the print used to pop off
the hot glazing plate with the most amazing perfect mirror finish which also
resisted finger marking. It was utterly reliable and foolproof, and vastly
superior in appearance to the rotary glazer. I can't remember the product's
name, but have never seen it again. I wondered if anyone else had
encountered it?
I wish I could glaze now, but have never been able to get a satisfactory
result from cold or hot flat glazing since. Any tips most welcome.

I remember doing the same thing about 25 to 30 years (gulp) ago Ed. It was
not uncommon practice then, both to cover retouching marks and to give a
little more of that 'wet print' depth to the blacks - remember that there
was no commercial selenium toner in the UK at that time to increase our
Dmax. Kodak did not export KRST here until the early '70s if my memory
serves. In fact it was hard to find out much about it in terms of what it
was supposed to do and how to use it. I well remember making my own from Se
powder etc in order to find out what it did as all the American 'masters'
used it and so I figured it had to be good, - but when I used it I was
surprised that it didn't seem to do much, little realising at the time
exactly why, as I was printing on bromide paper!

Back to the polish - it was in fact just that. I used to use neutral shoe
polish as it was this that I was shown by others who used this 'technique'.
I cringe at the thought of doing such a thing to a photographic print these
days, but considerations of archival permanence didn't seem to be so much to
the fore then - or maybe it was just that I was inexperienced in such
things. Amazingly however my 'polished' prints of those days still show no
sign of deterioration despite single bath fixing and no toning. Perhaps wax
polish is an archival treatment as well. Now there's a thought!

OK,  I dont know about anyone else,  but this is promising to get really
annoying if it keeps up until May 17th!  Can he be suspended from the list
for the time being so the endless cycle of automated replies can be
interupted?

&gt; &gt;On a slightly different tack, but maybe retaled to the same topic... does<br>
&gt; &gt;anyone know of or remember a type of wax polish that was applied to fibre<br>
&gt; &gt;prints. I remember this being used by a photographer friend in London in the<br>
&gt; &gt;late 1970s (I use the term &quot;friend&quot; guardedly... he wooed a favourite<br>
&gt; &gt;girlfriend of mine and married her! Grrrr!)... however, he was from<br>
&gt; &gt;Mendocino and I remember him applying a wax &quot;polish&quot; to his fibre prints<br>
&gt; &gt;with a cotton ball and then buffing it up with a soft cloth. Was this a<br>
&gt; &gt;protection or glazing remedy?<br>

	It won't, until the list admin kills that subscription, or
until Rick stops it, whichever comes first.

  Its evidently been taken care of since there are no more.
 When you see something like this please write to the list administrator
privately, since any messages sent to the list will simply generate more
autoresponses.

Hi Ed,
    I did polish in the past Ilfobrom to give some kind of" glossy" aspect
to the print. At that time I used natural with no color wax polish used to
polish furniture. It is still possible to find this kind of wax. I still
have few polished prints and they are in good shape(25years old) .They were
not Se toned and were fixed in regular one bath of sodium hypo.
    Good luck

Several months ago there was a mention (either on this list or a newsgroup) 
about drying FB prints between two fiberglass screens.  The idea was two 
make two aluminum frames with fiberglass screens (the kind you would use in 
a window), one to fit inside the other. Lay the prints between the screens 
and let them dry.  Hopefully with minimum curl.  My question is, does 
anyone know if there is anything in or on fiberglass screen that could harm 
the print?

Chris

  I have been using fiberglass screens to dry prints (face up) without any
problems.  Have used screens made from hardware store components or the Zone
VI ones sold by Calumet.  The screens are all the same size so they stack.
Not like the nesting pair that the above messare discusses.  FB paper will
curl no matter what you do to it - even if you look at it wrong ;-)  but the
screen stack minimizes the curl that you get.  Use a print flattener or run
them through a warm dry mount press to flatten them.   

One thing on home built screens is to use anodized aluminum frames and not
the "mill finish" non-anodized aluminum ones  -- corrosion and little bits
of aluminum grunge.  Tends to leave dark smears and smudges on everything.

I don't recall every reading anything about the print being between 2
screens.  The technique is to lay the wet print on one screen either face
down or face up.  Take your pick.  I lay them down face down.  (No, I don't
get screen marks on the face of the print.)  I wash the screens frequently
to make sure they stay clean.  I will stack the screens on top of each other
to save space.  One word of caution.  Do not mess with the prints until the
next day.  Also, the higher the humidity the longer the prints take to dry
and the flatter the prints will be.  Note: they will never be perfectly
flat.  I press the dried prints in a heated dry mount press for a minute or
so and that will really make them flat.  Good luck.
As usual,

Hello list members,

Has anyone used Crescent Perfect Mount to mount FB prints? I bought a few 32 
x 40 sheets recently and they seem to work great, much less effort and time 
than tissue and dry mount press. In case anyone has not used it, it is 
standard thickness white mat board, with an adhesive surface. It is 
relatively new, as I believe it was introduced only a few years ago.

Crescent advertises this product as "archival", but I am curious if it meets 
the "archival" standards of fine art fiber prints. 

It sells for about 10.00 per 32 x 40 sheet, so it's probably a bit more 
expensive than dry mounting, but of course you don't have the investment in 
the dry mount press, tissue, tacking iron, etc.

Any positive or negative comments would be greatly appreciated.

Bill Noll

I have been using a similar product for a while now, manufactured by Pres-On 
Merchandising Corp., Addison, Illinois, on 1-800-323-1745.  Similar pricing, 
it would seem - from 20 cents for a 5x7, 3 to 4 dollars for a 20x24, all the 
way up to 4'x8' sheets.  The product is available on a variety of mounting 
board compositions and thicknesses and, for most of them, is available in 
both Hi-Tack and Lo-Tack (will allow some repositioning if you screw-up) 
adhesives.

The Lo-Tack works fine with RC papers and the very, very flattest of the FB 
ones (ha!), but won't hold down the ripple edgesl, even after a month of 
weighting-down.  I'm in the process of playing with the Hi-Tack types.

Hi Bill and Group -

I fell in love with this product when it was first introduced and always keep 
some on hand in my darkroom for mounting RC prints.  Actually, I use the tissue-
only version of the product since I find the mat board variety is only useful 
for flush-mounting prints and much of the (expensive) coated surface is wasted 
if the print is to be overmatted.  It did take me a while to get used to 
working with the film product (easy to get bubbles) but once mastered, it 
provides a perfect presentation for RC which is so easily damaged by the heat 
from a dry mount press.

Fiber prints deserve different and special attention.  By far the overall best 
solution, all things considered, is dry mounting.  I know this is a contentious 
point so I'll elaborate why this is so.  

Let's get this out of the way first: in order for a print to meet archival 
standards, it must be removeable from its mount.  Many will say that dry 
mounting precludes this possibility.  This is not so.  Modern archival tissues 
are made specifically for reversal and I have found this to be accurate.  They 
melt at low temperatures and set on cooling.  Reversal is a matter of 
reapplying heat.  Even old fashioned tissues release if the print and mount are 
soaked in lacquer thinner (which won't harm the print).

For a long time when I was poor and didn't want to shell out money for a press, 
I rationalized why a print shouldn't be dry mounted and came up with all the 
usual anti-dry mount arguments we see all the time.  I used everything from 
rice paper and paste to archival corners.  The problem with any method other 
than dry mounting is warp.  Fiber base prints warp (actually, so do a lot of 
poly "R" prints).  We would experience such serious problems with warpage in 
our gallery - particularly in the summer - that people actually wouldn't buy 
prints because they were so unsightly.  There were, in some cases, 1/4 inch 
gaps betweeen the print and the mat - very unsightly.  If the print warps, it 
reflects light unevenly and seriously detracts from its viewability.  Before 
mounting, matting and framing, all of these prints had either been flattened 
under metal weights or actually pressed flat in a dry mount press.

I dry mount all of my prints on 100 percent buffered rag board with archival 
tissue.  These supplies are readily available.  I use Light Impressions and 
University Products for my supplies.  AA always dry mounted too, and, in fact, 
I've never seen any of his that weren't dry mounted.  The prints are protected, 
they look their absolute best and they are removeable if necessary (a quite 
unlikely event).  And, I eliminate that horrible warp!

Regards,
Curt

Hi Bill,

I've used the Perfect mount on RC prints, but I would be hesitant
about using them with fibre-based prints. This is not because of a
concern over the archival stability, but more over concern over
archival practice.

Drymounting is discouraged with archival material (photo or print
material) by most authorities. The reason for this is it is generally
not considered reverable, and the cardinal rule of archival
preservation is that anything you do to the object must be reverable.
If the mat is damaged, the print cannot be removed for remounting,
measning that a valuable original must be discarded, or stored
damaged.

I would suggest hinge mounting with rice paper, or tyvec tape, under
acid free museum mat.

The Seal dry-mount tissue I use is claimed to be reversible and archivally
buffered / acid free, though I can't find any real info about it.  The info
with the product is rudimentary - it does say it's reversible but doesn't
suggest *how* you remove it.  Anyone have any experience of this?

I dry my FB prints face-up on a towel having wiped the surface water off
first.  They dry reasonably flat, but 2mins in the press finishes the job
very well.

Thanks / regards
Richard

Forget any of the self adhesive boards for fibre prints. Even if you can get
them to hold edges initially, they will eventually start curling off the
mount board.

Hi,
Don't know if anything harmful has been found, but this is exactly the way I
did it for 20 years.  Some of those prints are pushing 40 years now and
holding up fine.  I used wood frames, but whatever.  There's a little curl,
but not as much as you'd get without the top screen.  And it beats the heck
out of any machine dryer I saw in those days--and is cheap!  They drymount
just fine.
Regards,
John

Friends,

Consider that a photo image is already a composite structure, gelatine
coated on paper.  That much alone is fragile, subject to curling, and
easily torn--not very 'archival' to me.  Dry mounting places the print in a
protected position, physically and if on the proper mount, chemically.  To
me, the object to be preserved archivally is the mounted print.

Museum people would argue with you on that point.

>To me, the object to be preserved archivally is the mounted print.<

If you want to dry mount, go ahead just don't be suprised if a museum
curator decides not to collect your prints because of it.  While it is true
that many photographs from the "Golden Age of Photography" (the 30's and
40's) were dry mounted and have survived, many have not.  Check your own
family albums for examples of poor photo print processing.  I own two Edward
Westons and one Ansel Adams.  Both are dry mounted but they are from that
age I just mentioned.  They, of course, were two of the most prominent
workers of the time.  Not everyone washed the prints as well as those two.
Can we sell images to buyers and their heirs not be assured that if the
damned thing starts to stain they can take corrective actions?  The dry
mounted print assures us of just that scenario.  However, the choice is
yours.  Far be it from me to try and stop you.  I only wish to explain my
position.

As usual,

Having "been there and done that", I'll chime in.  Over the years (exactly
how many is nobody's business ;) I've shot using everything from 16mm Minox
to 4x5 (and I currently have deeply lustful instincts for an 8x20). I have
owned 4 or 5 different 35mm cameras, about the same number of MF systems,
and 3 different LF cameras - this is all I can remember at the moment.  So,
I know the angst you are going through.  Here are a couple of suggestions
to ponder as you make the choice:

1) Are you primarily interested in making pictures or are you fascinated
   by the hardware?  Both are legitimate aspects of photography, but with
   very different goals.  (I, BTW, have both diseases.)  If you like the iron,
   I'd buy the Leica because of its beauty and elegance.  Actually, I'd wait
   until Nikon reintroduces the S rangefinder at $4000, 'cause that is just too
   cool. 'Course, the mortgage would have to wait a few months...

2) Do you seek status?   I'm not trying to be cruel, but an awful lot of people
   enjoy the status points associated with a Leica, a 'Blad, or and SLR that weighs
   more than my car.  This is mostly harmless - who among us isn't proud of
   a prestigious toy - but you have to come clean with yourself about motive or
   you'll spend a bunch of money on something that does not really do what you want,
   in this case, make you proud of your trinket.

3) If you truly want to make pictures, you have to decide what kind.  I had a
   debate here a few years ago with someone who was an equipment hound themselves,
   and they finally got it through my thick skull that different kinds of
   equipment encourage or discourage different kinds of shooting.  At the time,
   I was in the purist "a good violinist can play symphonic music on an $80
   rental instrument" school-of-thought.  As I've matured, I've realized that
   this is a crock - the hardware you choose has to match the intended task
   in photography just like any other discipline.  The right camera will
   encourage you to shoot in your desired style, the wrong one will prevent it.

   For *most* things,  I have a preference for the largest possible negative.
   (If I could effectively shoot candids with an 8x10 view camera, I'd get one.)
   Strictly from an image  quality and tonal fidelity POV, an average ancient Mamiya
   C TLR will  consistently blow the socks off the best Leica/Nikon/Canon/Contax 35mm
   because 'there ain't no substitute for square inches of neg'.
   Caveat:  You have to understand and love that old 'C' - the older lenses
   are flarey, and the really old ones do not fit into the above category -
   they have the resolving power of a Coke bottle - that's what makes them
   fabulous for portraits which is where I mostly used them.

   However, image fidelity is not the whole story.  Fast action is best
   done with some sort of rangefinder with a very snappy shutter - I used
   a Mamiya Universal press for that.  REALLY fast action requires a motor
   drive and a mule to carry the camera and lenses around - an camera
   bag loaded with F5 paraphenalia and lenses probably weighs more than
   my backpack full-o-'Blad.  Inobtrusive means small and quiet - Leicas
   excel here, 'Blads suck at this.  View cameras really suck at this.
   

4) The great news is that you do not have to choose.  Listen carefully
   Grasshopper - new camera equipment is almost always a waste of 
   money unless you absolutely must have a feature that is just now
   becoming available (not true in your case because of the choices
   you face) or the item you seek is expected to become collectable
   (the aforementioned Nikon S and the special edition Leicas come
   to mind here).  If you do your homework, figure out what you really
   want, and exert patience, you can easily end up with some version
   of both formats in your bag for about the same price of either new.
   No, you won't get a deal on eBay, but there are plenty of reputable
   dealers in Shutterbug who will help you spend money responsibly.
  
   One of the best cost-saving devices out there is to buy a camera
   one or two models older than what is current.  Buy a used Mamiya 7
   instead of a 7-II or a 'Blad 500 C/M instead of a 501 C/M, an
   old M3 or M4 instead of an M6.  Sure, you may have to pay some
   dough to have the thing cleaned and adjusted, but you'll still
   be way ahead if you shop carefully.  This point was hammered home
   to me this summer.  I had a bag full-o-'Blad with me in Spain
   and was robbed of all my possessions by an evil troll near an
   on-ramp in Barcelona.  Among the items stolen was an old 40mm
   'C' Distagon which cost me $1500 used and another $175 to rehabilitate.
   I replaced it with a new one (insurance covered it, or I would never
   have bought one new) - new price: $4300!!!  Is the new lens
   better than the old one - sure, but it is really tough to see the
   difference in the final pictures between the two lenses, you REALLY
   have to be looking.  In most cases you cannot tell.

   Why is this the case?  Because the premium manufacturers like
   Leica, Hasselblad, Mamiya, Nikon, Canon, etc. have been doing such
   a good job for such a long time that these days they are tuning
   really small improvements into their stuff.  Another example:
   I shot stuff on an ancient Leica IIIf with an equally ancient
   f/3.5 Collapsable Elmar that what every bit the equal of the
   latest Nikon lenses I had later in life.  Sure, if you push
   the gear to the very edge of its performance, the newest IS better,
   but how often do you shoot straight into the sun without a lens
   shade and count on the multicoated optics to save you from
   flare (that won't work anyhow even *with* the newest lenses ;)


Now, I'll come clean.  After having too much stuff in my possession
gathering dust, I got rid of everything I didn't need or use and settled
on:

   A Wisner 4x5 Technical for what I love most: big beautiful arty B&W prints.

   A Hasselblad for the same purpose when the subject or the shooting
   environment or the amount of time I have cannot sustain 4x5 suffering.

   A Fuji GA645Zi for making decent pictures of the above type without
   unduly annoying my family while vacationing - they seem to think
   that vacation has other purposes than taking pictures.  The nerve!

   A Sony DSC-F505 digicam for snapshots, family pix, and the like.
   It's got that lovely Zeiss zoom glass on it and I think it's the
   best value in digicams around.  In the 6 months I've owned it, nobody
   has come out with more features for less (or the same) money - in the
   digital world that's a bloomin' miracle.  It's only good for 8x10s,
   but I never put anything bigger than that in the family album anyway ;)

Nope, no 35mm.  Except for very specialized use like really LONG lenses,
practical 35mm photography using traditional processes is DEAD.  Yes,
I know there is lots of it still out there, but photojournalists,
sports photographers, and commerical photographers are all switching for
a very good reason.  I'm essentially a B&W art photographer who does
all my own processing etc., and some will consider this heresy, but
facts is facts.  For the kind of photography at which 35mm excels,
digital is coming like a freight train.  The output technologies are
excellent, affordable, and widely available.  The only thing stopping
it in the consumer space is that you need a computer to fiddle with it.
Once someone gets smart (hey Polaroid and Sony are ya listening - your
first efforts in this area were horrible) and produces a cheap way to
make high-quality snapshots from the serial or USB port on a digicam,
the whole 35mm consumer space is going to self-destruct - I still be
in the darkroom using silver myself...

In the course of performing those professional tasks which provide the
funding for a) my photographic vices and b) the running of pure-silver,
I will find myself in the UK at the end of this month on business.

I may well have one evening free in Nottingham (Friday 4/25) and would be
delighted to meet any UK pure-silver subscribers in an appropriate
setting (pub with Wadsworths 6x available).  The press of business
makes it impossible for me to be certain if I will indeed be free, but
if any of you would like to tentatively schedule a meeting, please contact
me privately, not here on pure-silver.

By the way (he sez modestly), my article in the current issue of C&D seems
to have had the salutary effect of adding subscribers to this list - we
are now up to 232 subscribers world-wide.  Silver will never die...

People do not always shoot what is the most efficient, or best.  I work
primarily in the digital arena, but I play in the film world.

And don't we all live to play?

You're right, of course, but in-the-large, people tend to shift to what is
most convenient.  There will always be 35mm film shooters, just like we silver
addicts will always be around no matter how digital the world gets.  But
the pace of technology innovation and, more importantly, technology
adaptation and penetration, makes this a foregone conclusion IMHO.
Couple that with the science-free environmentalism most people uncritically
accept (chemistry=death) and I believe you will see huge movement away from
chemical-based consumer photography in this decade... its already happening.
Look at what point-n-shoots did to the SLR business - how many tourists do
you see dragging a "real" 35mm camera around - fewer and fewer, but you
see point-n-shoots everywhere.  I think the pattern will be the same here,
it will just happen a lot faster.  We'll see.  Anyway, who cares - I like
my camera in crates, my film in sheets, and my lenses to be loud ;)

Hello,
I've been using Leicas for a looong time (gosh, I'm so old already?!), and 
considered seriously switching to Mamiya a couple of years ago. And in the 
course of analyzing what would be the advantages and disadvantages i 
realized that using Leica means shooting hand-held in situations where 
Mamiya lenses would not allow me to do it. According to your kind of 
photography, having lenses at 2.0 and 1.4 may be an advantage. Mamiya 
lenses in comparison are much slower. And if you have to use a tripod, why 
use a rangefinder with a limited game of optics?
But as usual, it's just my two cents based on personal use and experience.
Could you rent a Leica and a Mamiya and see in real situation?
Bets regards.

Of course it all boils down to what sort of photography you wish to do.  But
I find one reason for prefering 35mm in many situations is increased depth
of field.

Hi All,
Given the method of communication, you may think this reply a little late:
my only excuse is that I have to earn a living.  Due to an allergic reaction
to photo chemicals I have long had to use a rotary drum for processing my
prints; both colour, and of course the proper sort.  My favourite drum is a
JOBO 2850, it will handle up to 12 x 16 prints, R.C. or fibre. It has a snap
on lid, and chemical sump that allows it to be loaded with both chemicals
and paper whilst in a vertical position. The chemical can only flow onto the
paper when the drum is laid horizontally onto the motorised roller base.
Being of plastic construction it is very easy to wash, and keep clean.  It
uses about 50ml of liquid for each stage of the process. I store my ready to
use chemicals in screw top brown glass 1 pint bottles. I find they keep well
for up to about a month, if full or protected with a gas spray. I have
smaller (100ml) plastic screw top containers for the chemicals I am actually
using, obviously one for each. The chemical is poured back from the
processing drum into these after each stage, about 20% of the chemicals
stays on the paper or in the drum, so these small tubs have to be topped up
between each print. I have not found any problems with cross contamination,
as long as the drum is washed and dried after each use. At the end of the
session these small containers are washed out. The preliminary wash is also
given in the drum so that when its lid is removed most of the chemical is
gone. If the drum is then stood on end and filled with water it helps to
free the print, especially FB, and of course helps further with the washing.
Consistency of process times is as important, just as if you are processing
roll film, since you only see the result when its too late to do anything
about it; no snatched prints with this method.
 I find several advantages to drum processing over using trays. (i) Less
fumes and smells. (ii) Once loaded you can work in ordinary lighting. (iii)
Less danger of fogging, a bigger problem than many realise. (iv)
Repeatability, providing you keep note of your times, both exposure and
developing. (v) Saves paper; you can't work so quickly! Don't worrey about
the colour of the chemicals, its the result that counts. I hope this is of
some help.
Regards Dave Miller.

A fascinating topic, and I can't resist chiming in.
	I think what you need to consider is your whole system, and how and
what kind of photos you take and output.
	I, too, have used a variety of formats, and types within formats over
the course of many years.
	Are you producing B&W prints?  Then you need to control the whole
process, need access to a darkroom and enlarger, and if you move up to
6X7, you need an enlarger and lens setup that will handle the larger
negatives.  You may be inspired to make larger prints, so your trays and
sink have to accommodate 16X20.
	I'm always amused by the photographers who blow almost their whole
budget on a fancy SLR with some lenses, and then have nothing left for
the darkroom end of it.  If I only had a $1000 to spend, less than half
would go for the camera link in the chain.
	I lost quite a bit of interest in the Mamiya 7 when I learned that the
camera can't do a tight head shot portrait, of the kind that is
routinely accomplished with a 180mm lens in 35mm format, or even a 105
macro.
	Working close, with wide angle lenses in low light is certainly the
Leica forte.  But last time I looked, a Nikon 35/1.4 was about $500, and
the same lens (well, not really the same, but you know what I mean) for
the Leica was $2,500.  There is no such lens for the Mamiya 7.
	It's all a matter of tradeoffs, but look at the big picture: what kinds
of photos you take, and how you whole system will work to produce them.
	On the other hand, if they're just going into a glass case...
	Regards,
	Phil

Yes Barry, I used it as a release agent for hot glazing, following the =
days of using Ox Gall, until I discovered RC Glossy papers. It was =
called MHS Photo Enamel, and as you say worked very effectively.  The =
technical description given at the time said it was  "an acetone =
derivative with an amino base which works by surface polymerisation on =
becoming amphoteric under evaporation"  You probably remember that bit!

As for putting a polish on the lustre papers of the day (my favourite =
was Bromesko) various methods were used.  'Doping' with a very light =
transparent mixture of mastic varnish linseed oil and turpentine was =
one. Another was polishing with an encaustic paste. this was made from =
white wax made into a paste with turpentine and a dash of dammar =
varnish!  Tim has mentioned a neutral shoe polish, the favourite I =
remember was made by Meltonian.  All these treatments to some extent =
covered up spotting and knifing, and were widely used in print finishing =
at one time.  Are the treatments archival?  Well, I have a number of =
prints so treated that have been stored in my loft for up to forty =
years. If they come to any harm in the next hundred years I will let you =
know!!

I stopped using mounting tissue when I discovered "Manders Guard" this =
was a PVA solution that was painted onto the back of the print and =
allowed to dry. The print, covered with a clean handkerchief, was then =
ironed onto the mount with a domestic Iron, and followed with a cold =
Iron or book.  The advantage over tissue is that a much lower =
temperature was needed.  When Guard disappeared from the market, I made =
an alternative using UniBond PVA adhesive.  It is thinned with water to =
the consistency of 'the cream on the top of the milk'  and used as =
described.  Again, is it archival?  None of my old prints show any signs =
of deterioration due to its use. I still use this method for pasting =
cuttings into a scrap book: much less messy than using liquid glues. But =
window mounts are the fashion of today, and its much less bother, and I =
think better.

Sorry I have no car stories!
Clifford.

I use Fusion 4000 and release paper when dry mounting my fiber prints.  I 
heat the dry mount press to 225 degrees, takes about 45 seconds to make a 
great bond.  Fusion 4000 will not begin to breakdown for at least 400 years, 
the manufactor says so I am not super concerned with the archive issue.

I live in the Arizona desert with high temperatures.  Fusion 4000 will never 
bubble, give way or curl..humidity has no effect on the product at all.

Many thanks to all who responded to my original question regarding Perfect 
Mount. Crescent Perfect Mount is indeed an inexpensive, easy to use, acid 
free solution, but I hadn't considered the fact that it's not reversible and 
therefore not archival.

Perhaps a distinction should be made between archival processing for fine art 
prints and archival processing which meets the stricter (and reversible) 
standards of museums and curators. I simply can't imagine a casual collector 
(or individual who buys photography for decor purposes) soaking and/or 
heating their print to remove it from a damaged mat.

Thanks again for the valuable information.

Bill Noll

I think you are correct that most buyers will never try to remove a print from 
a mount neither will there ever likely be any reason for them to feel any need 
to do so.  It is possible that museums no longer buy dry mounted photographs.  
I've never sold to museums.  All of AA's prints in his travelling exhibition 
are dry mounted.  These prints were made in the early '80s - not so very long 
ago - and museums are certainly exhibiting them.

I really think the issue is viewability.  I would be perfectly happy to use 
corners, rice paper hinges, etc. to mount prints if it weren't for the very 
nasty and very real (print) warping problem.  This isn't imagined nor is it 
only an occasional problem.  I have never seen a fiber print that was not dry 
mounted not warp in the frame and look ugly.  The print will force a gap 
between the mount and the mat and the print becomes wavy and, depending on the 
severity of the waves, becomes unsightly for the viewer.  Can anyone speak to 
this issue specifically?  If we can overcome this serious problem, then we can 
probably all standardize on hinge mounting.

Regards,
Curt

Clifford,

Thanks for all the detail.  As I do a lot of 20"x24" prints, and am looking 
to take a bite out of my 30"x 100' roll of paper, the investment in a 
drymount press for same could run into a bit of money.  I'm interested in 
trying it our, as I have dozens of unmounted 20x24's, FB, that just don't 
seem to stick to the cold-mount products around the ripple-edges.

As you mentioned RC prints in your letter (not in this context, of course), I 
wonder if you have used the PVA stuff on only RC prints?  Over thirty years 
ago, before RC prints (and before PVA was commonly used),  I tried a variety 
of adhesives (I was heading a petroleum-products testing lab at the time), 
and wasn't enthralled with anything I found.  The various adhesives that did 
seem to work, tended to bleed into the fiber base and were often visible from 
the front of the print.  Granted, adhesive technology has bounded ahead, far 
beyond the days when we used to have to keep the Eastman Kodak 
super-glue-equivalent in the refrigerator or freezer.  I wonder if the 
Uni-Bond brand is a particular favorite, or if any PVA adhesive would work.  
As you mentioned "thinning it with water to the consistency of cream", I 
assume that you would not be referring to the ordinary polyvinyl acetate 
glues (white glues) such as Elmer's.

Thanks again,

Pete Schermerhorn, in the glorious Berkshire hills of western Massachusetts

Thanks for the comments, Lee.  I hope others join in with their ideas for 
eliminating wrinkling.

One of the things I've been doing in the last year or so is to print the image 
with a very large border, e.g. I'll print a 35mm negative to 8x12 on 11x14 
paper.  With the new dye-based archival pens I then sign in the lower right, 
just below the image area.  I then mat the print leaving 1/4" of white showing 
sides and top and 3/8" at the bottom.  This gives the presentation that looks 
similar to AA.  Just for the heck of it I might try a 3/8" perimeter band of 
dry mount tissue on the print.  This would allow an archivist to remove the 
entire image with some white area and signature intact.  It may sound goofy but 
this warping is even goofier.  For my commercial prints, I use 4 ply rag as the 
mat and mount and back that with 1/8" archival corrugated board.

Curt

Hi Curt,
    While this is a true statement, things in the archival world have
changed.  The early '80's is quickly becoming nearly 20 years now.  Time
flies when you are having a good time.  As I stated in an earlier post I own
two Ed Weston images and on AA.  All are dry mounted.  Conservators would
shudder but that was the way it was done in that era.
    The issue of print wrinkling is a real issue.  Where I live in the
spring wrinkling is worse than in the summer.  Humidity seems to be the
reason.  I live in Texas and in the DFW area we can get pretty humid in the
rainy season.  Also, right now I have several framed images that are not
mine hanging on the wall in the living room.  All but one image is matted
with no white border (island style mat) and the ones that are matted flush
with image (that is, the mat is at the edge of the image) shows no wrinkling
at all.  The one that is the island print has wrinkling.  Go figure...
    One of the things I do when I mat and frame a print is I double the back
board at least once and have been known to use several backing boards.  Lots
of framers when using wood frames will seal the last back board to the
frame.  I think it is mostly for dust protection but it might limit some
humidity also.  I really can't speak to that.
    As to your comment that you have never sold an image to a museum, join
the club.  Most images are donated rather than purchased by museums.  Sure,
some are but not from the likes of me.
As usual,
Lee Carmichael

Curt,

I've been following this thread for a few days and today taken stock of how
the 50 or so prints I've acquired over the past 10 years were presented to
me. Of the ten or so John Sexton, Anne Larsen and Ted Orland images I have
all were archival dry mounted and over-matted ready for framing... the
remainder of the prints I have are from UK photographers... none of which
were mounted or matted. The conclusion I have come to is that photographers
across the pond sure are much more serious about what they do compared to
photographers over here.

If you are mounting RC prints, try Scotch PMA, a nice mounting adhesive that
works well. It comes in rolls & one lays the print on the adhesive, cuts
around the edges, burnishes the adhesive on and peels off the removable
layer covering the back. Then place your print on the mount board & burnish
it & you have a nice, clean mounted print.

Thank goodness you don't want to join the car sub committee of Pure Silver!
We must have been in telepathic connection back in the old days. I too used
Mander's Gard and a domestic iron, and my 30 year old prints show no
deterioration either. Hadn't thought of the dilute Unibond substitute
though. I did successfully use the domestic iron with dry mount film too
incidentally.
As to "an acetone derivative with an amino base which works by surface
polymerisation on becoming amphoteric under evaporation"  - I just think you
are showing off! I refuse to believe you memorised that for nearly 3
decades. I'll bet you saved the instructions! I couldn't possible believe
you had the original pack still?
Regards
Barry

Yes Barry, I used it as a release agent for hot glazing, following the days
of using Ox Gall, until I discovered RC Glossy papers. It was called MHS
Photo Enamel, and as you say worked very effectively.  The technical
description given at the time said it was  "an acetone derivative with an
amino base which works by surface polymerisation on becoming amphoteric
under evaporation"  You probably remember that bit!

As for putting a polish on the lustre papers of the day (my favourite was
Bromesko) various methods were used.  'Doping' with a very light transparent
mixture of mastic varnish linseed oil and turpentine was one. Another was
polishing with an encaustic paste. this was made from white wax made into a
paste with turpentine and a dash of dammar varnish!  Tim has mentioned a
neutral shoe polish, the favourite I remember was made by Meltonian.  All
these treatments to some extent covered up spotting and knifing, and were
widely used in print finishing at one time.  Are the treatments archival?
Well, I have a number of prints so treated that have been stored in my loft
for up to forty years. If they come to any harm in the next hundred years I
will let you know!!

I stopped using mounting tissue when I discovered "Manders Guard" this was a
PVA solution that was painted onto the back of the print and allowed to dry.
The print, covered with a clean handkerchief, was then ironed onto the mount
with a domestic Iron, and followed with a cold Iron or book.  The advantage
over tissue is that a much lower temperature was needed.  When Guard
disappeared from the market, I made an alternative using UniBond PVA
adhesive.  It is thinned with water to the consistency of 'the cream on the
top of the milk'  and used as described.  Again, is it archival?  None of my
old prints show any signs of deterioration due to its use. I still use this
method for pasting cuttings into a scrap book: much less messy than using
liquid glues. But window mounts are the fashion of today, and its much less
bother, and I think better.

Sorry I have no car stories!
Clifford.

What on earth is Fusion 4000? Not that temperatures here in the UK are
likely to test it!

I use Fusion 4000 and release paper when dry mounting my fiber prints.  I
heat the dry mount press to 225 degrees, takes about 45 seconds to make a
great bond.  Fusion 4000 will not begin to breakdown for at least 400 years,
the manufactor says so I am not super concerned with the archive issue.

I live in the Arizona desert with high temperatures.  Fusion 4000 will never
bubble, give way or curl..humidity has no effect on the product at all.

Not all of us.  I don't mount mine (of course, I don't show them either), and 
I certainly don't mat them.  I wouldn't know how to do it.  It seems a shame 
to waste all that wall space with flat white areas, when the space could be 
more properly used for more picture area.  After all, its the content that 
should count, and not the decoration.  If you need room for a title and a 
signature, a piece of paper could be stuck on the wall under the photo.

Sorry for the heresy.

It isn't heresy, it is the difference in dumping a dead fish on a table and
setting a plate of smoked salmon with a full course dinner.

If your images are worth anything, you present them as such.

Tim, a year ago I had the same "approach-approach conflict" as your
correspondent. I was in Singapore, on a 'round the world trip. I decided
to send my Canon FD system and my Fuji 690 back to San Francisco because
they were too heavy for my backpack travel style. I was willing to buy
either a Leica or a Mamiya 7. Prices were very good on the Mamiya
system, average for the Leica. In the end, I shipped home the
abovementioned cameras, retained a Fuji GS645S and bought a clean used
M6 and 35 + 50 Summichrons. I get beautiful 16X20 and larger prints from
the Fuji 645 negs. The best Leica shots are close at 16X20. The Fuji is
plastic, feels like a toy, and has no soul. The M6 is a Leica!

The decision, in the end, was an emotional one. Unfortunately, I have
since sold the Leica system as well as the Fuji 645, but some dau I will
get another Leica.

Regards, Bill Lawlor

All,
Hear, hear, Dan.  Well said.  No one will consider you serious if you don't
let them know through presentation that you are a serious worker.  In that
regard, no one will value your work if you don't value the work yourself.
As usual,
Lee Carmichael

"If your images are worth anything, you'd present them as such."

I heard that all my photographic life.  Then, sold bunches of my prints
'right out of the box' of dried, ready to mount prints.  More than the
mounted, matted ones.

Go figure.

Ed and Group -

John Sexton is one of the US's most respected fine art photographers.  He was 
also AA's last assistant.  I suppose there is some reverence given to the old 
ways of doing things and it is tough to give up on such a successful and 
effective means of presentation.  I suppose some would say that doesn't make 
him right.

I still believe that archival dry mounting provides the best compromise of 
safety and viewing pleasure.  Every print I have ever sold is offered as you 
have described here.  Since I keep unmounted prints of all my images in stock, 
I guess if a museum comes knocking at my door, I'll happily sell from that 
stock.  As a practical matter, I can't afford to be replacing my customer's 
prints if they warp enough to become unsightly.

Exactly.  That is why I choose to present the work itself, not a lot of 
distraction and clutter.  If it's good enough to stand on its own, it doesn't 
need pretensions. Check with Dan for more of my feelings on this subject, if 
you care.

There is an article in the newest B&W magazine - the new magazine here for B&W 
photography collecting - in which there is an interview with a very big French 
collector.  From what I gather, all his images are prints only - no matting, 
mounting or framing.  He keeps these in files and takes them out to look at 
them as the mood strikes him.  

Perhaps when we sell framed images, we should supply and extra, unmounted print 
along with the matted, mounted and framed one (reflecting it in the price a 
bit).  That way, everybody could be happy, no?

is at least as good as mounting tissue.  The Iron setting is at the lower

Iron the mount, both sides before starting to ensure it is perfectly dry.
This also ensures flatness after mounting. Also dry the covering material.
If you have a mounting press you can use it set to a lower temperature.
Use old newspaper for pasting, brushing out to the edges of the print.
Use a 1" paint brush and wash thoroughly immediately after use. Water will
have no effect once it is dry. If allowed to dry you will need to wash in
carbon tetrachloride.
If you should get any PVA on the face of the print, it can be removed easil=

with carbon tetrachloride or dry cleaning fluid.

What I want to know is why when I was approached to submit images to the
gallery where Steve works, I have to have my images dry mounted (which I
reluctantly did) and matted?  If you sell more just as prints does that mean
I am being persecuted for matting the images?
As usual,

Right out of the Ilford Fact Sheet, "Processing B&W Paper RC".

MOUNTING
Ilford prints can be mounted in one of the following ways.  Where prints are 
to be mounted for long periods (in excess of 1-2 years), the dry mounting 
method is recommended.

Okay, my turn to weigh-in.. .now where's that soapbox?...
 I've been photographing for about 30 years now and of the many hundreds 
of photographers whose work I've seen, those that finished their prints 
by spotting,mounting, matting and framing were the ones who's work 
progressed and impressed the most.
 They were the ones showing off their work and getting feedback and 
criticism and "living" with their images- getting tired of the "weak"ones 
and really understanding the "strong" ones. It didn't matter if they dry 
mounted or not- in fact many of my friends corner mount all their work. 
What mattered is that they showed their work.
I've met thousands of photographers over the years who have a huge pile 
of wrinkled (even RC ones)unmounted prints. Every one of which comes with 
an excuse or explanation as to why it wasn't worth framing or not quite 
finished.
You don't have to mount or matt or frame just like everyone else- but 
showing pride in your work by finishing and displaying is a celebration 
of your work and yourself.
I also have mounted and unmounted versions of my best work and the dry 
mounted matted prints are the easiest to hold up and show the world 
without the distractions of wrinkles, weird backdrops, and excuses.

Lee,
It may be a matter of convenience (for the gallery), as it is easier and 
'safer' to show prints to potential customers when they are matted. And 
also minimize the risk of damaging the print as people will touch only the 
mounting board. Besides, it may help people who are not used to look at 
pictures as photographers do to get a better idea about what the photograph 
will look like when framed.
Seems to me that this all discussion is very typical of photographers' 
concerns. The bottom line is: do you make photographs for the sake of 
photographing, or are they for sell? If photography is for you just a 
hobby, or if you live out of a trust fund set up by daddy, keep your prints 
the way you want. If you're trying to make a living out of it as a full 
time photographer, you may want to accomodate the people who sell them or 
the one who buy them. I dry mount my photos, for various reasons, but 
always offer the choice of corner mounted when someone buy them. The way I 
see it, it's the choice of the buyer, not the seller. Sorry to be so 
'bottom line' oriented, but I had a couple of reality checks since I opened 
my own gallery.
Now... if one day I become famous and in great demand, I'll probably take a 
diva approach and just impose my views of how my images should be treated ( 
see, when i use famous I use the word image!). But if that happens, I'll be 
dead for a long time and it would not really matter to me anyway.
Happy photographing!

Barry,
You had better believe I still have the original plastic bottle of MHS =
Photo Enamel with about quarter inch left in the bottom. Why have I kept =
it?  My memory is not that good!!

Pete,
I am not familiar with Elmer's glue, but if it's a white PVA woodworking =
adhesive, then I guess it should work OK.  Alternatives available in the =
UK which may be available to you are 'Evostik Resin W' woodworking =
adhesive and 'Bostik Rapid Wood Adhesive'. I have used both =
successfully.  I have not used this mounting method with RC papers. In =
my experience RC papers sit nicely in a matted mount - certainly up to =
12"x15".

Dan,
Yes, Trichlorethylene is toxic, but so are many other things found in =
the darkroom. As an alternative I mentioned dry cleaning fluid. I had in =
mind "Thawpit" (I did not specify because it may not be available to =
you) which is based on "Genklene", an ICI product.  Another readily =
available "safer" product is Tipp-Ex correction fluid solvent, which =
contains 111Trichloroethane. But be warned, all these should be used in =
a well ventilated area, and can be harmful.  I wonder how many typist =
have been killed by it!

Clifford.

Guess it's my turn to interject a little bit of info here. It is my 
understanding that the main purpose of the mat is simply to prevent the print 
from coming into contact with the glass when framed. As you may know, 
photographic prints will stick to glass after it has been in contact for some 
time. The "distraction and clutter" is mostly a side effect.

 Exactly.  That is why I choose to present the work itself, not a lot of 
 distraction and clutter.  If it's good enough to stand on its own, it 
doesn't 
 need pretensions. Check with Dan for more of my feelings on this subject, if 
 you care. >>

Barry,
You had better believe I still have the original plastic bottle of MHS Phot=
o
Enamel with about quarter inch left in the bottom. Why have I kept it?  My
memory is not that good!!

Pete,
I am not familiar with Elmer's glue, but if it's a white PVA woodworking
adhesive, then I guess it should work OK.  Alternatives available in the UK
which may be available to you are 'Evostik Resin W' woodworking adhesive an=
d
'Bostik Rapid Wood Adhesive'. I have used both successfully.  I have not
used this mounting method with RC papers. In my experience RC papers sit
nicely in a matted mount - certainly up to 12"x15".

Dan,
Yes, Trichlorethylene is toxic, but so are many other things found in the
darkroom. As an alternative I mentioned dry cleaning fluid. I had in mind
"Thawpit" (I did not specify because it may not be available to you) which
is based on "Genklene", an ICI product.  Another readily available "safer"
product is Tipp-Ex correction fluid solvent, which contains
111Trichloroethane. But be warned, all these should be used in a well
ventilated area, and can be harmful.  I wonder how many typist have been
killed by it!

Clifford.

I guess no one has bothered.  The Kodak catalogue number 7732-18-5 is for
water.

  Actually this is the CAS number not a catalogue number. If you check

Richard,

Tony McLean (whom you know of on another list) was mildly surprised when he
read the MSDS on distilled water... but completely taken aback when the pyro
content in his coffee was enough (albeit with a little accelerator) to
develop a film.

Have you tried Dragon's blood poured on chicken entrails at midnight ,of a full moon, and chanting HOH HOH HOH?

Seriously, what are you specifically looking for: old formulas, new formulas, vegetable and root dyes,
metal toners( copper, platinum, gold), weird effects. A few more clues please.

				yours clarifying my opinions,

Erm,

Given that you are interested in COPPER toning and "Brit-Puns", should the
subject of your message not have been

"'ello, 'ello 'ello" ?

  A good source for things to do might be back issues of _American
Photography_ magazine from the 1930's. It was the great bastion of the
Pictorialist movement. Actually, there are a lot of very interesting
articles in it along with all the formularised stuff on how to apply
Dynamic Symmetry  to composition. One of the criteria for the
respectibility of Pictorialists seems to have been the amount of "control"
or retouching/manipulation applied to both negatives and prints. Once
prints have been made you are somewhat limited but can still apply
selective bleaching to remove features you don't want, and the drawing in
of other features by the use of pencil or other media. There are also ways
of finishing the surfaces, Mortensen's "abrasion tone" comes to mind. By
using this process its possible to make a photographic print look like a
charcoal drawing. I drew this process to the attention of Dick Sullivan of
Bostick and Sullivan, who is now offering instructions and a material kit
for it. 
  The Pictorialists didn't like color (except perhaps for very esoteric and
difficult processes like three-color carbon) but you don't have to be
limited by this stricture from the past. B&W prints can be colored by
selective toning, using removable masking to expose only part of the print
to the toner, and by hand coloring by the use of conventional photo-oils or
even hi-lite markers. Hi-Lite markers can be used to produce subtle effects
like coloring only the eyes of a portrait.
  If you haven't made the print yet you can try my favorite, the paper
negative process. This is easy to do. You need to make the original postive
print and the paper negative on paper wihthout back printing, or at least
make sure any back printing doesn't show through. Esentially the process is
to make a positive print, contact print that to make a paper negative, and
make the final print from the paper negative. The contrast and exposure of
both the original positive and paper negative should be adjusted by
experiment for their purpose. Neither will look right as a reflection print. 
  Retouching can be done on both the original positive and paper negative.
Obviously, anything darkened on the original positive will be dark on the
final print, anything darkened on the paper negative will be lightened on
the final print. Retouching on the emulsion side of either will be sharp,
retouching on the backs will be diffused. Pencil works for most of the
retouching. Bleaching can also be done. Its possible to remove or add large
parts of the image. If much work is to be done periodical tests must be
made to see what the effect is. 
  See Tim Rudman's _Photographer's Master Printing Course_ for lots of
stuff on toning.
  Remember that you can also tone using a mordant and dyes. That can also
be done selectively. In fact, once the print has been mordanted, you can
paint on it with the appropriate dye. I've seen examples of this that look
like full color prints.
  Hours of pleasant entertainment for those long winter nights, at least
until, the new Clark Gable picture gets to the Bijou...

Maybe this has been my problem all these years; I have been using Duck
tape.  Maybe I'll check out this new fangled Duct tape you are talking
about here.

Well y'all it is an old Southern Gallery custom to use archival acid free
Duct Tape to attach the prints to the wall (flat black tape naturally)!
This really saves on framing and matting costs - that beautiful 2 inch wide
black border really makes the prints stand out.  In an emergency, gaffer's
tape can be used but it is not archival.  Heavens sakes, do not use the
silver or NASCAR Racing Duct Tape - major faux pas.  

Dry wall screws are in the proper matte black finish and are also reversable
for mounting purposes.  If you live in an area with high humidity or salt
spray, either the polymer coated, galvanized, or stainless steel deck screws
get around the rusting problems.  A dab of stove blacking is needed though.
For curling FB print edges, that two sided carpet tape will stick 'em down
real good.  Hot melt glue leaves too big a bump and fresh fly paper tends to
release in hot weather.  The critters stuck on the prints are another problem.

Not to be taken tooooooo seriously,

Previous post not withstanding, here is some info on Seal's Fusion 4000
mounting film.  It is a polymer film (not a tissue) that is claimed to be
archival and reversable.  I have had good results using it to mount RC and
color prints.  The stuff sticks better than the Color Mount or the Archival
tissues from Seal.  It is supposed to be "self triming" but I go ahead and
use the traditional paper cutter approach.  The procedure with this product
is a bit different that traditional dry mount products.  Since this is a
polymer film and not a tissue, it has very little structural strength and is
quite stretchy.  The best way to mount a print is to tack the film to the
back of the print with a fairly cool tacking iron and a sheet of release
paper to protect the film from having a hole melted in it by the iron (and
getting a gooey mess on the irom).  Sandwich  the print and film between two
sheets of release paper and run through the press to adhere the film to the
back of the print - this takes about a minute with a platten temperature of
about 190F.  Let it cool, peel off the release paper and trim.  

There will probably be a bit of "flash" or squeeze-out of the film around
the edges.  Seal says that if you use release paper on the film side, and
brown paper on the print side, when you remove the stack from the press,
quickly peel off the release paper followed by the print from the brown
paper and the excess film should adhere the brown paper leaving a neatly
self-trimed print ready for positioning and mounting.

Position the trimed print on the mount board, carefully tack in place, and
give it a run through the dry mount press to complete the process.

The stuff sticks a lot better than most of the RC tissues and does not tend
to leave loose edges.  It also works for FB prints but I like the good old
sticky dry mount tissue for them.

Best Regards,
     Howard F. Efner

Browsing through my email, this evening, I chose to respond to this because
of the five Steves on this list I wasn't sure the one referred to was me.

Though Howard was amusing, and made me smile; I wanted to clarify something.

There is fewer joys in photography that can usurp the completion of a fine
print, clarifying some details with controlled techniques and the final
spotting, mounting and matting the print to be saved and shown behind glass
or pelexiglass.

Taking that to the ultimate when being present as one of these prints sells
to someone who will then covet it with the precision we put into these fine
prints is gratifying, and so it is when somebody buys five pieces of another
photographer, then turns to [mine] in an old Kodak Bromide F 2 box and finds
an unmounted, unmatted print that was wanting to curl but was restrained by
the other fifty prints squeezed into that box.

These folks traveling more than a thousand miles from their home who just
invested a couple grand in another artist plunks down some hundred or so for
the out-of-the-box print from the artist/salesperson himself will certainly
take it to a framer once back at home.

I did begin a dissertation about PVC Glue, though, Howie.

Dark print. Shit!  Copper toner offered by Luminos though not their own
brand one they promote:  instructions, 'Be sure the print is over exposed by
at least 10% or more.'  Hmmm, dark print, copper toner ...   Yes!

It saves!  Copper toner saves prints.

I love Fusion 4000.  I do the brown paper trick to remove the excess.  I buy 
it is MASSIVE rolls...and find it quite in inexpensive.  Release paper can be 
reused many times untill it is folded or gets dings in it...then needs to be 
replaced.  I buy large quantitys cheaply at picture frame supply houses.

If you are using Windoze 9x, you might find a switch to NT4 or 2000 a bit
less drastic, because you can still run all your apps, but you will find
that it causes MUCH less trouble.

I am hoping that someone can give me some info. on 220 roll film. The idea of 
twice the number of frames is very appealing, but I have heard that the 
emulsion is thinner and difficult to handle/ put on the reel for developing 
etc. It is great to have so many experts out there on the list so wonder if 
someone would care to give me the characteristics and  pros and cons of 220 
vs 120. Thanks--Saffron.

As you pointed out, there are benefits to having double the amount of 
frames on a roll, and yes, it is a bit more difficult to load and 
deal with in the dark, and does have  thinner emulsion.  And because 
of that, we don't particularly care for the 220 versions out there on 
the market.  perhaps it is because of the different base and 
thickness, but for the better quality of neg's, stick to the 120 
version.

Based on some mentions on the internet,
I bought a can of this paste wax from Light Impressions, to
see what it would do on b&w photos.  On a matte finish
Ilford FB paper, it went on and changed the appearance
not at all.  It is not possible to distinguish the waxed
from the unwaxed by look or feel.  Is this right? Did
I perhaps rub it off too much?  On a semi-matte finish
(RC) it also made no change.

I had hoped to try to make a matt print with some
portions in the foreground glossy.  This apparently
is not the way to do it.

There are a lot of misconceptions about 220 film.  220 film is the exact same
thing as 120 film except that. it is twice the length.  How this is done, 120
film has a paper backing that is the entire length of the film.  Whereas 220 film
only has a paper leader and trailer.  it can be a little difficult to load at
first because it is twice the length, but that is only a minor consideration.

I use 220 quite frequently, 120 occasionally  (Ilford HP5+), and have never
noticed any quality difference between the two. I also haven't experienced
any significant problems loading it on the reel. Perhaps someone has done
some tests and determined that there's a quality decrease with 220 but I've
never observed anything like that and I'd be surprised if there is (though
I've been surprised many times before so it wouldn't be anything new). I
thought the only differences between the 120 and 220 versions of the same
film (e.g. HP5+) were the obvious ones - 220 has no paper backing and is
twice as long but I never thought they were different films or had different
emulsions.

Not sure if I follow your previous logic, but if you
want to make the surface glossy, I belive you want
coat the surface with a gelatin solution, say 10%; but
you can vary this concentration as your experience and
needs dictate. It should work wery well. 10% may be a
conservative amount... or... perhaps you will need to
apply the 10% coat 2-3 times to the same area... (Let

Hi Daniel -

I'm not sure where you live but I have learned from some experience with my 
buddy in England, getting good PMK is very difficult and very expensive.  

The first big problem he and I deal with is getting TRUE PMK the way Gordon 
Hutchings formulated it.  Every time he tries, someone is making some 
substitution somewhere in the chemistry, usually indicating they've "improved" 
the formula by doing so.  Right now, it appears someone made a big error in 
formulating his part B (sod metaborate).  

Quite frankly, the only way I know to get proper PMK AND a good value (in 
places other than the US) is to buy the chemistry in bulk and make it up 
yourself.  To give you an American example, I buy enough chemistry to make up 4 
liters of part A and 8 liter of part B (equal to 8 liters of the part A as you 
have bought it - or 50 TIMES the amount you are describing).  The cost for this 
huge quantity is about $90 US!  My hair stands on end when I hear these 
outrageous amounts.  The other thing that may be a real problem in other parts 
of the world is the chemicals involved: some simply may not be available and 
therefore chemists are making substitutions.

I believe this is incorrect. It is the same film but
they can get more of it on the reel by eliminating the
paper backing. Be careful with older cameras that have
the little red window on the back for frame numbering
- it will fog 220 film.

Hi all:
Does anyone know a cheaper method of using PMK developer?
At the moment I am using the FILM PLUS version which comes in two 150 ml =
bottles (Part A and Part B).
As I use it to develop 5x4 sheets of negatives in a tank I have to =
produce a 1600 ml of working solution which means that at 1 part A, 1 =
part B and 48 parts of water, the 150 ml bottles last for about 5 goes =
and at =A310 they do not come cheaper.
Is there another option (apart from buying the ingredientes, a scale and =
make it up on my own)?
Thanks
Daniel Eugenio

The development reels for 220 have capacity for twice the length of 
film.  I suppose you could fold 220 in the middle (emulsion out) and put it 
on a 120 reel  ;-)

I've never used 220.  Do the reels fit in the same tanks that are used for
120?  If so, the spirals must be coiled tighter ... does this require any
extended development time, or changes in agitation?

Development is the same.  Both types of reels will fit into a standard tank
- the coil is tighter for a 220 version.  Better chance for getting air bells.  

The only real advantage for 220 vs 120 is that you do not have to reload as
often.  Handy for the wedding photogs.  Cost (US) per unit length is the
same ie 2 roll 120 = cost of 1 roll 220.  Limited selection of 220 films
though.  There are some cameras and film backs that are specific to 120 or
220 due to design differences in the pressure plates to compensate for the
paper backing (or lack thereof).
Best Regards,

  Hi all:
  Does anyone know a cheaper method of using PMK developer?
  At the moment I am using the FILM PLUS version which comes in two 150 =
ml bottles (Part A and Part B).
  As I use it to develop 5x4 sheets of negatives in a tank I have to =
produce a 1600 ml of working solution which means that at 1 part A, 1 =
part B and 48 parts of water, the 150 ml bottles last for about 5 goes =
and at =A310 they do not come cheaper.
  Is there another option (apart from buying the ingredientes, a scale =
and make it up on my own)?
  Thanks
  Daniel Eugenio

  You can use what you need and develop in a tray.  One oz per 10 square =
inches, for example 4X5 equals 20 square inches equals 2 ozs of =
developer.

  PMK is expensive.  Get used to it.  HC 110 is nice, too.

The 220 reels that I have look about the same as my 35mm reels, just wider.
My 120 reels have a heavy gauge wire where the 220 & 35mm reels look to be
about the same gauge.

It's mine, but quite a few people (including me) have had difficulty in
accessing it. The new one is fine, and this is the one I shall be updating
from time to time. The old one will disappear entirely soon.

Paterson reels have capacity for one 220 film or two 120 films on the same

The development reels for 220 have capacity for twice the length of
film.  I suppose you could fold 220 in the middle (emulsion out) and put it
on a 120 reel  ;-)

Patterson 120 reels are actually 220 (and 35 mm for that matter) reels as
well so with that system you don't need either a separate tank or separate
reels for 220.  As far as I know, this is true also of other systems  but
the only one I have used for years is Patterson. so I have no recent
experience with others.

Hi -

I respectfully disagree.  I have a 4 liter bottle of Part A stock and 8 liters 
of Part B stock in my darkroom and the cost was less than $100 US.  Considering 
this is enough developer to develop upwards of 1800 rolls of rollfilm or 8000 
sheets of 4x5, I'd say it's a whole lot cheaper than HC110.  The trick is to 
buy quantity and mix it up yourself.  

I use so much of this stuff with students I need to buy it in volume.  The 
Formulary has it in large quantity and they'd be real happy to sell it in 
whatever volume you need, I'm sure.  All my friends tell me I'm going to be 
poisoned by PMK but the fact is I'm extremely careful not to get any on my skin 
or to cause any outgassing of the liquid.  One must also take care when 
decanting from large to small containers, particularly 
if there's a lot of headspace in the larger bottle.

Regards,
Curt

Hello !
A 120 film is about.84 meter long. A 220 film is twice that lenght. Not
far from a135 36 exp film. So a reel able to acomodate a 135 film will,
if able to allow for the extra width, handle a 220 film perfectly. 
Plasitc adjustable wheels generaly do. (JOBO one allow to put two 120
films on one reel). Of corse with stainless steel one, this is not
always true. (As far as I remember, the HEWES brand are different for
120 and 220)
Hope this helps.

Hello !
Have you considered buying at Photographer formulary ? They sold both
the powder version and a liquid concentrate . Try :
http://www.photoformulary.com/index.htm
Also Silverprint in London may have it : try :
http://www.silverprint.co.uk/
Hope this helps.

All

For those who may recall, a few weeks ago, Sylvia and I posted a
question concerning the quality of Japanese lenses versus German lenses
for which we received much kind advice.  Having embarked on conducting
our own detailed tests some of you may be wondering what the results
were.  So, if interested, read on...

Simply restated we were trying to get more quality out of our 11" x 14"
monochrome prints and deciding if we should move from Leica Rangefinders
to MF (Japanese or German lenses.)  Problem is that we have lots of $$$
already invested in the Leica gear, including a V35 enlarger which is a
great piece of gear for doing 35mm or 35mm.  Ours was a field practical
test using our methods and limitations rather than anything scientific.
We rented a Hasselblad and photographed the local mission in San Jose,
CA.  The Hasselblad 80mm lens was set one stop smaller than the Leica M6
50mm to get a similar depth of field and both cameras were properly
mounted on a tripod.  We used Ilford PANF film developed in ID-11. 
Printing was on our usual satin finish paper with identical size
finished images geared around something like a x12 enlargement from the
35mm negative.

We found the difference between the two images not to be as much as we
would have anticipated.  We prefer rectangular format to square
photographs which means of course that 6 x 6 has no advantage for us
over 6 x 4,5.  Doing the obvious and using a tripod just like we you are
supposed to a(nd would do with MF anyway) gives a useful boost to 35mm
used with a slow film.  For us, any move should really be to a larger
than 6 x 6 format.  Obvious candidates are the Mamiya 7, Pentax P67 or
possibly a Fuji all of which were mentioned in replies to our original
posting.

If we were starting again, then definitely we would go MF and no doubt 6
x 6 would be fine but to do so now is very difficult to justify due to
cost and the fact that the difference between 35mm and 6 x 6 (or of
course 6 x 4.5) is not so big.  Recognizing that we originally bought
the Leica gear due to it's ease of carrying on hikes and high quality, I
guess we will keep it for that job and probably buy a Pentax P67 which
is an affordable complementary solution and will make a significant jump
in negative size.  Guess we will have to buy another enalrger too :-(

We recognize that this may seem contentious and/or obvious but that was
our conclusion and solution to our particular needs in our specific
situation.  Hopefully this may be of use to someone.

Regards
Malcolm and Sylvia

Hi

My father has discovered a box of mouldy - or is it moldy prints, that
date from as early as the just after the turn of the century (19th that
is !).  They have been poorly stored in damp conditions and have some
fungicide damage.

Does anyone have any advice on how to best clean and preserve these
please.  I presume that he can just wash them but is this enough ?

Regards
Malcolm

The usual advice is to first make a photographic copy of any unique
print before you mess with it.

I assume that museum curators would be able to point you
to restorers (or books on restoring) paper.

Washing in water might not be a good thing if the paper is
weak.

There are people who make a business of digital restoration
of heirloom photographs. That way you can leave to your heirs
a box of CDs, which instead of becoming moldy, will suffer
some other fate.  Like not being readable.  Remember 5.25 inch
floppy disks?

Sylvia, for great optical quality, light weight, low cost, and simplicity
you might consider Fuji rangefinders. I have gone 'round the world with a
GS645S and have photographed in Bali with a GSW690II. I make 16X20 and
larger prints from Reala 100.

I  have 16X20 comparison prints taken with a Summichron 50/2 and the GS645S.
The Summi is very good but pushed to the limit of film and resolution while
the 645 is just loafing along with "miles to go". The 690 doubles that
potential.

These cameras cost less than the least expensive Leica lens. The 645 weighs
750 gm, the 690 1500 gm. The 60mm 645 lens is equivalent to a 35mm and the
GSW690 65mm lens is equivalent to a 28mm!

This is an interesting message, thanks for posting it. Obviously, as I'm
sure you recognize, there still were a lot of variables that you couldn't
control in trying to make your comparisons. The main one that occurs to me
is the enlarger/lens. Presumably you used a different enlarger and lens for
the 6x6 than you did for the 35 mm. Also, you probably know your 35 mm film
exposure index and developing times and methods but probably haven't done
tests on the 6x6.  I don't at all mean to be critical in saying these
things - you went to a lot more trouble and time than most of us do when we
try do compare cameras, lenses, formats, etc. - it's just that doing really
scientific or semi-scientific tests of photography equipment can be
difficult because of all the variables.

FWIW, I've never used Leicas but I do use Nikon pro quality lenses. I also
use (much more than 35 mm) the Pentax 67. I've never done the type of
testing that you did but FWIW even with 8x10 enlargements I think I see a
subtle but nevertheless obvious difference most of the time between my 35 mm
prints and my 6x7 prints. The difference isn't so much in "sharpness" as it
is in tonal range. The larger negative seems to provide a lot more subtle
gradations of tone  than 35 mm. I think you'll be pleased with Pentax
equipment, particularly if you print in rectangles so that with Pentax you
will be printing at or close to full frame as compared with cropping 6x6
down to something more like 6x4.5 to get a rectangular print.

If you do tests with Pentax similar to what you did with the Hasselblad, I'd
be interested in hearing your conclusions. Thanks again for the message.
Brian

I can echo this and affirm it strongly - I have a GA-645Zi and, blown out to 16x20, I can
just (barely) see a difference when compared to my Hassy negs similarly cropped to 
645.  I have hauled the Zi to Asia and Europe already this year and I am thrilled
with it - a really fine camera with terrific optics.  If anyone cares, I posed a
review of it about 8 months ago or so on rec.photo.equipment.medium-format and it
can probably be found in the Deja archives...

Ok, I just got on this group so maybe this has been said:  a year ago I
bought a Mamiya 7II rangefinder camera; 6 x 7 cm negs, very lightweight,
very simple to use, I am in love with the camera.  The lens is an 80 mm
which is equiv to a 37 or thereabouts.  I shot a whole studio nude project
with this camera and a 4 by 5, Tmax 100 film, and cannot tell the difference
at 11 x 14 print size between the two formats.  I love the 4 x 5, but for
travel it is definitely the Mamiya I would bring above any other format.
Just ordered the (gasp) 150 lens for it,too.
Chris

  There is a goodly amount of material on mold and how to deal with it on
the Conservation On Line site at http://palimpsest.stanford.edu   Read
through it before doing anything. 
  In general mold and fungus are very hard to remove. They damage the
material they are growing on. Fungus can partially digest the gelatin of
the emulsion leaving it water soluable so infected film or prints should
_never_ be cleaned with water or water-based cleaners, they will dissolve
the emulsion.
   The safest approach seems to be to copy valuable material before doing
anything to it. This is always a good practice.
  The artifacts should be dried out to get the fungus into an inactive
state where it becomes powdery. It can then be gently blown or brushed off.
Such cleaning should be done where the spores can not infect anything else. 
  The emulsion side can be cleaned with a non-water based film cleaner. The
best cleaner is 1,1,1, Trichlorethane. Get high purity stuff.
Unfortunately, trichlor is an environmental hazard so is not longer as easy
to find as it was a few years ago. 
  I beleive Edwal still puts up trichlor film cleaner.
  In any case, read through the stuff on the Stanford site. You may also
want to talk to an expert preservationist at an archive. 
  I also suggest calling the professional division of Kodak's customer
service department, they may have specific recommendations. In the USA they
are at: 1 800 242 2424 extension 19.
  Again, mold and fungus are far from trivial problems. Anything which is
an effective fungicide is also highly toxic to humans. It is extrmemely
difficult to get rid of fungus infections permanently.

Chris - Yes, I agree!  The Mamiya 7II is very light and easy to take into
the field.  I regularly carry mine when hiking, along with a couple of
lenses.  I used to own Leica M6's with several lenses, and I doubt that the
Mamiya outfit weighs much more.  I tried Hasselblad for a while, but the
Mamiya handles better for field work.

Ok, I just got on this group so maybe this has been said:  a year ago I
bought a Mamiya 7II rangefinder camera; 6 x 7 cm negs, very lightweight,
very simple to use, I am in love with the camera.  The lens is an 80 mm
which is equiv to a 37 or thereabouts.  I shot a whole studio nude project
with this camera and a 4 by 5, Tmax 100 film, and cannot tell the difference
at 11 x 14 print size between the two formats.  I love the 4 x 5, but for
travel it is definitely the Mamiya I would bring above any other format.
Just ordered the (gasp) 150 lens for it,too.

I too see little difference in technical print quality between 6x7 and 4x5
with 11x14 (or smaller) prints. I don't notice a "sharpness" or tonal range
difference between these two formats until I move up to a 16x20 print.
However, I still prefer 4x5 because of the movements and the ability to
custom process each negative. With 6x7 I find I often have to stop down so
far to get the necessary depth of field that diffraction becomes a problem.
With 4x5 a little front tilt will often allow use of a much smaller
aperture.

One reference which may be a starting point on conservation and restoration
of negatives and prints is THE KEEPERS OF LIGHT.  They have a chapter on
restoration and also a list of references to other works on the same
subject.  They do discuss the problem of mold or "foxing" of prints.

Good luck with your project and the search for a medium format system.

JIB - Yes, I agree with this. If the subject is likely to fool the meter,
then you must get up close to do the metering, then go back to your shooting
position for your exposure.  This hasn't been a big problem for me.  ---
John.

The only problem that I have with the Mamiya rangefinders is that the meter
can
be easily fooled by side lighting.  I think that as expensive as those
cameras
are the meters should at least be dead on all of the time.
