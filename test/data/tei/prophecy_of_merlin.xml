								<p>sayings; When feythe fayleth. Versions of this lyric - identified
									as "Chaucer's Proverbs" - were regularly printed in earlier
									editions of Chaucer. Richard Morris's edition contains the
									following lyric:</p>
								<lg>
									<l>Qwan prestis faylin in her sawes, </l>
									<l>And Lordis turnin Goddis lawes</l>
									<l>Ageynis ryght;</l>
									<l>And lecherie is holdin as privy solas,</l>
									<l>And robberie as fre purchas,</l>
									<l>Bewar than of ille!</l>
									<l>Than schall the Lond of Albion Turnin to confusion, </l>
									<l> As sumtyme it befelle. </l>
								</lg>
								<p>As printed in The Poetical Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, rev. ed.
									(London: Bell, 1875), vol. 6, p. 307. Skeat prints a similar
									version of this poem from Caxton's edition of Chaucer, as the
									first one of the "Sayings" (or proverbs) of Chaucer: </p>
								<lg>
									<l>Whan feyth failleth in prestes sawes,</l>
									<l>And lordes hestes ar holden for lawes,</l>
									<l>And robbery is holden purchas,</l>
									<l>And lechery is holden solas,</l>
									<l>Then shal the lond of Albyon</l>
									<l>Be brought to grete confusioun.</l>
								</lg>
								<p>See Skeat's Complete Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, vol. 7 (Oxford:
									Clarendon, 1897), p. 450.</p>
