   Normal alum hardening does reduce the uptake of spotting dyes a little, 
however that can be overcome by diluting the dye in a mildly alkaline 
solution. SpoTone suggests dissolving an Alka-Seltzer and using that to 
dilute the dye. I've used both this trick and just water with a little 
bicarbonate of soda in it. Never had a problem with the dye.
   If I'm doing a lot of spotting I like to save the Alka-Seltzer for me.
  I should point out that the hardener in the fixing bath is meant to undo 
the damage to manufacturing hardening by the soaking of the emulsion in an 
alkaline developer followed by an acid stop and fixing bath. The alum 
reduces the ability of the gelatin to swell. Once the paper drys the 
swelling goes away but while its wet the swollen gelatin is subject to damage.

All, I can confirm that Luminos and Forte are NOT the same

I am new to this mailing list. Has anyone had experience with DiXactol developer
available from Photographers Formulary? How does this compare to pyro
developers, esp PMK?
Thanks

Hi,

I'm fairly new to the list, and new to darkroom black and white printing as
well.  I received a used Omega B-600 enlarger as a Christmas gift last
December.  It came without a bulb, so I went to the store and purchased a
household 60w soft white bulb, and have been using it that way.  I think the
prints look good, but I'm afraid that I'm not getting the best quality
because I'm not using the correct bulb.  What bulb should I be using?  Is
there a source out there for the correct bulb?  Sorry about the elementary
nature of my question.

James,

Without new people like you getting into B&W photography and darkroom 
printing we're all going to have a rough time finding chemistry, paper, etc. 
in the not too distant future, so I hope your new hobby becomes a lifelong 
passion for you!

I don't know the specific answer to your question (I'm sure another list 
member will), but I can recommend Harry at www.classic-enlargers.com as an 
Omega expert. He would also carry the correct bulb if you need one. His 
website has a forum, and he personally answers all email, usually the same 
day.

Good luck!

Bill Noll

No doubt other people will give you their unbiased comments, but since I
devised DiXactol and Photographers' Formulary sell it for me on a royalty
basis, it would be wrong for me to extol its virtues broadcast to the whole
of the pure-silver group. It doesn't exist to receive commercials! If you
would care to email me direct on development.coaching@dial.pipex.com, I will
give you chapter and verse on DiXactol and could snail-mail some photocopies
of UK magazine articles if you wish.
Hope that helps.

    Since it uses a bulb with a standard household screw base the right 
lamp is likely a type PH-211 available from camera supply stores. This is a 
75 Watt lamp with "opal" glass envelope. The glass is a lot more diffusing 
than a standard reading lamp and will produce much more even illumination 
when used in condenser enlargers. The maker's trademark is stamped on the 
neck rather than the end of the bulb so it won't be imaged onto the film.

Having "lurked" for some time, maybe it's now time to contribute. Barry is
far too modest, as a convert to DiXactol I would recommend it highly, just
follow the comprehensive instructions carefully, and if using it for 2 bath
development, buy brand new spirals to be on the safe side. I don't think
you'll be disappointed if you try it. 

All the best from grey old London town

I don't know about the Forte/Bergger similarities, but Forte and Luminos
are 2 different papers. To begin with, Luminos is made in England. Their
base is also different. Their speed is different. They do not have the same
reaction to selenium toning. We do have Luminos and Forte in the US of A.,
and that's the only two brands of papers I use for years.
By the way, Bergger is still of a curiosity over here. Their film is not
readily available. The last time I ordered Bergger in 4x5 from Bostick and
Sullivan, I got the 3 last boxes, and was told that they didn't know when
it will be available again, as Bergger was working with a new importer,if I
remember correctly. Was 3 or 4 months ago.
Best.

Dear Berry,
 I think it's still possible for you to enter into a 
conversation/discussion of the qualities and process of using DiXactol 
and to describe the comparison with PMK without being guilty of wrongly 
extolling it's virtues, I trust you to keep your ego in check... even 
so! I'd like to hear information and your experiences shared on this 
list and I hope I am able to tell the difference between information 
and a commercial. Personally I'd also like to know how this developer 
compares in process and results when compared to PMK...  for one, is it 
more or less as environmentally toxic? And even if someone did 
interpreted your experienced comments as a commercial, I'd still value 
them much more than a thousand "me too!" sponsorship posts. If 
experianced and knowledgeable people fear to comment on this list, then 
I am missing the intent of the list.

Hello !
One day I was on a hurry, and needed to have a dry FB print quickly. At
that time, I've no drying/glazing machine, and of course no dry mount
press. So I tried a trick I often use with Ilfochrome and RC prints :
The hair drier.
You have to pass the air dryer slowly above the print, really near on
the hottest setting it has, with a smooth and even motion. At one time,
the paper began to curl badly. Turn it inside out and do the same thing
until it curls on the other side. With a little practice, it will be
dried and flat in a few minutes. Drawbacks : It is slow and painful if
you have hundred of 20x24 prints...
Some time ago I've seen an homemade press to flatten prints without
heating them. According to the guy wo built it, it works.
May be it will be worth a try ? see :
http://www.infomaniak.ch/~bonavolt/prees.htm 
This guy has got a lot of ideas, not only in the photographic world.
Hope this will help

Dirk:
I know nothing of this enlarger, but my Beseler 23C XL got a new lease
on life when I dropped an Aristo cold light unit into it.  It replaces
the condensers.  It does require that you use "under the lens" filters
for VC printing, but I can't detect any difference.  Compared to a true
VC head with dial in contrast, this is admittedly cheap and dirty.

Phil:
         Yes, there are many paths up the mountain.  Before I switched to 
the VCL 4500 head, I worked with several different methods, including the 
one you are using.  I had a v.54 light source on my Elwood 5x7 enlarger and 
I thought it did a pretty good job.  Several friends have the Zone VI and 
one friend has the Aristo VCL 4500 that I finally bought used.  When I was 
using the v.54 head, I thought, to my eye, that the best results for my 
negatives was to use the Green 58 for the highlights and a Blue 47b filter 
for the shadows.  I also, made the tests with the blue light first and then 
added the green light to control the highlights.  Different friends start 
the other way (green first and then the blue).  Rather than vary the filter 
grade, I simply varied the time allowed for the filter to achieve the 
contrast I wanted.  For the record, either way will work.  Pick the method 
you are comfortable with and work at it.  I finally settled on some filter 
material that a friend gave me that is from Lee filters.  One of the 
instructors got it from one of the camera shops in Dallas.  I don't know 
the numbers but if you are interested I could probably get them for you.
         Yes, the head I have now on the D2 does not require filters.  All 
though it allows me to dial in a particular filter setting by mixing the 
green and blue lights, it just doesn't make sense to me to do it that 
way.  By using the lamps separately I can match the contrast and print 
density exactly to the individual negative.  I suppose if I had to make 50 
or some large number like that from one negative I might have to rethink 
the whole thing.  One of the benefits of the head I have now is speed and 
that I was never able to get the same black I now get without having blue 
filter times that were very long.  They were in the 60 to 90 second range 
and some times they seemed to contaminate the green affected areas.  That 
has not happened with this head.

Hi Lee - When you say that it doesn't make sense to mix the blue and =
green in a single exposure, are you suggesting that you achieve =
something by exposing the two (blue and green) separately that you =
couldn't achieve by mixing the two in a single exposure? If this is what =
you're saying and doing you might want to read Phil Davis' article on =
this subject that appeared in "Photo Techniques" magazine (under its =
former name) in late 1994 or early 1995. It pretty well dispelled the =
notion that split printing for the overall exposure achieves something  =
that couldn't be achieved in a single exposure.=20

I've used the VCL 4500 head for about five years now and it is a =
wonderful instrument but I don't think there's something magic about =
using it to make one exposure with blue and another with green, as =
opposed to combining the two in a single expousre. But maybe I'm =
misunderstanding what it is you're saying and doing.

  Subject: Re: Bulbs and VC light source, printing method


  Phil:
          Yes, there are many paths up the mountain.  Before I switched =
to the VCL 4500 head, I worked with several different methods, including =
the one you are using.  I had a v.54 light source on my Elwood 5x7 =
enlarger and I thought it did a pretty good job.  Several friends have =
the Zone VI and one friend has the Aristo VCL 4500 that I finally bought =
used.  When I was using the v.54 head, I thought, to my eye, that the =
best results for my negatives was to use the Green 58 for the highlights =
and a Blue 47b filter for the shadows.  I also, made the tests with the =
blue light first and then added the green light to control the =
highlights.  Different friends start the other way (green first and then =
the blue).  Rather than vary the filter grade, I simply varied the time =
allowed for the filter to achieve the contrast I wanted.  For the =
record, either way will work.  Pick the method you are comfortable with =
and work at it.  I finally settled on some filter material that a friend =
gave me that is from Lee filters.  One of the instructors got it from =
one of the camera shops in Dallas.  I don't know the numbers but if you =
are interested I could probably get them for you. =20
          Yes, the head I have now on the D2 does not require filters.  =
All though it allows me to dial in a particular filter setting by mixing =
the green and blue lights, it just doesn't make sense to me to do it =
that way.  By using the lamps separately I can match the contrast and =
print density exactly to the individual negative.  I suppose if I had to =
make 50 or some large number like that from one negative I might have to =
rethink the whole thing.  One of the benefits of the head I have now is =
speed and that I was never able to get the same black I now get without =
having blue filter times that were very long.  They were in the 60 to 90 =
second range and some times they seemed to contaminate the green =
affected areas.  That has not happened with this head. =20



  At 07:43 AM 06/04/2000 -0400, you wrote:

    Lee:
            It's a single tube.  At one point, I replaced the tube with =
the model
    that Aristo recommends for VC paper.  It produces a blue-green =
light,
    with relatively short exposure times, as this seems to the =
wavelength
    that the paper is sensitive to.  I assume when you say two tube that =
you
    have separate control over the blue and green, so you don't even =
need
    filters?  My whole set up, tube and drop in carrier with diffuser, =
and
    separate power supply, cost about $150 new.  The true VC heads with =
dial
    in contrast are about ten times that amount.
            For what it's worth, I seem to get the best results with a =
"backwards"
    split filter technique, loosely derived from Fred Picker.  I use a =
3, 4,
    or 5 filter (depending on my assessment of the negative), and print =
for
    a "minimum exposure for maximum black."  Then I look at the =
highlights,
    and add exposure through a 0 or 1 filter until I have the highlight
    texture that I want, frequently burning in dense areas, or holding =
back,
    say, a face, while the 0 or 1 filter darkens the rest of the =
negative.=20
    When I read about "proper" technique, I frequently see the =
suggestion
    that one expose for highlights, then add higher filtration until a =
true
    black is achieved.  There are many paths to the mountain top.
            Regards,
            Phil
    PS I went to the Aristo after testing my Beseler with no negative in =
the
    carrier, exposing for an even grey with a number 5 filter.  The
    resulting print showed wildly uneven tonality, when it should have =
been
    an even grey.  Proper alignment on these machines is another long
    story...

Brian Ellis said:

"When you say that it doesn't make sense to mix the blue and green in a
single exposure, are you suggesting that you achieve
something by exposing the two (blue and green) separately that you
couldn't achieve by mixing the two in a single exposure?"

	I agree completely in theory.  However, in my case, split exposures let
you arrive at an exposure which might lie between filter grades. If, for
example, the proper filter grade would be 3.75, you can't get there
without combining exposures.  With control over green and blue light in
a VC head, you can achieve a sliding scale of contrast ranges.  Also, I
seem to wind up burning and dodging most negatives, and I enjoy the
control of adding just one slice of the spectrum to a given area.
	Regards,
	Phil

For those that care,  the message in question came from Brian Ellis (sorry
Brian) and was titled "Re:Bulbs and VC light source, printing method".  One
other note on not being infected by scripts,  I run Outlook (not Outlook
Express) and view everything through the preview pane.  Scripts wont run in
the preview pane,  but it presents a funny blue "S" shape at the top right
corner of the pane telling me there is a script in the message that will run
if it is opened.  I am able to delete the Kak worm before it ever gets a
chance to run.  Hope that helps someone.

Brian:
         When I said what I said, I think that it doesn't make sense to me 
to have to test everything again.  I really don't care that it is a print 
made with a #2 grade filter or whatever.  All I care about is that the 
negative and the paper grades match and the print is the best I can make 
it.  With  the split filters system I agree that there is nothing magical 
about the split filter system, but for me, it sure makes it easier to 
achieve a museum quality print faster.  Maybe it is just me.
         Phil said that sometimes he needs a 3.75 filter and with the VCL 
4500 box and dial you can mix the light.  That seems like a lot of tests 
and I really don't have time to spend in the dark testing all the papers 
and seeing if I like the results.  I already have the tests done for the 
split filter system and now all I do is print.

Hi Lee - When you say that it doesn't make sense to mix the blue and green
in a single exposure, are you suggesting that you achieve something by
exposing the two (blue and green) separately that you couldn't achieve by
mixing the two in a single exposure? If this is what you're saying and doing
you might want to read Phil Davis' article on this subject that appeared in
"Photo Techniques" magazine (under its former name) in late 1994 or early
1995. It pretty well dispelled the notion that split printing for the
overall exposure achieves something  that couldn't be achieved in a single
exposure.

I've used the VCL 4500 head for about five years now and it is a wonderful
instrument but I don't think there's something magic about using it to make
one exposure with blue and another with green, as opposed to combining the
two in a single expousre. But maybe I'm misunderstanding what it is you're
saying and doing.

  Phil:
          Yes, there are many paths up the mountain.  Before I switched to
the VCL 4500 head, I worked with several different methods, including the
one you are using.  I had a v.54 light source on my Elwood 5x7 enlarger and
I thought it did a pretty good job.  Several friends have the Zone VI and
one friend has the Aristo VCL 4500 that I finally bought used.  When I was
using the v.54 head, I thought, to my eye, that the best results for my
negatives was to use the Green 58 for the highlights and a Blue 47b filter
for the shadows.  I also, made the tests with the blue light first and then
added the green light to control the highlights.  Different friends start
the other way (green first and then the blue).  Rather than vary the filter
grade, I simply varied the time allowed for the filter to achieve the
contrast I wanted.  For the record, either way will work.  Pick the method
you are comfortable with and work at it.  I finally settled on some filter
material that a friend gave me that is from Lee filters.  One of the
instructors got it from one of the camera shops in Dallas.  I don't know the
numbers but if you are interested I could probably get them for you.
          Yes, the head I have now on the D2 does not require filters.  All
though it allows me to dial in a particular filter setting by mixing the
green and blue lights, it just doesn't make sense to me to do it that way.
By using the lamps separately I can match the contrast and print density
exactly to the individual negative.  I suppose if I had to make 50 or some
large number like that from one negative I might have to rethink the whole
thing.  One of the benefits of the head I have now is speed and that I was
never able to get the same black I now get without having blue filter times
that were very long.  They were in the 60 to 90 second range and some times
they seemed to contaminate the green affected areas.  That has not happened
with this head.

    Lee:
            It's a single tube.  At one point, I replaced the tube with the
model
    that Aristo recommends for VC paper.  It produces a blue-green light,
    with relatively short exposure times, as this seems to the wavelength
    that the paper is sensitive to.  I assume when you say two tube that you
    have separate control over the blue and green, so you don't even need
    filters?  My whole set up, tube and drop in carrier with diffuser, and
    separate power supply, cost about $150 new.  The true VC heads with dial
    in contrast are about ten times that amount.
            For what it's worth, I seem to get the best results with a
"backwards"
    split filter technique, loosely derived from Fred Picker.  I use a 3, 4,
    or 5 filter (depending on my assessment of the negative), and print for
    a "minimum exposure for maximum black."  Then I look at the highlights,
    and add exposure through a 0 or 1 filter until I have the highlight
    texture that I want, frequently burning in dense areas, or holding back,
    say, a face, while the 0 or 1 filter darkens the rest of the negative.
    When I read about "proper" technique, I frequently see the suggestion
    that one expose for highlights, then add higher filtration until a true
    black is achieved.  There are many paths to the mountain top.
            Regards,
            Phil
    PS I went to the Aristo after testing my Beseler with no negative in the
    carrier, exposing for an even grey with a number 5 filter.  The
    resulting print showed wildly uneven tonality, when it should have been
    an even grey.  Proper alignment on these machines is another long
    story...

Does anyone have any idea of the storage life of wash aid mixed 400 ml:2 oz 
Kodak Rapid Selenium Toner?  I use Sprint Fixer Remover (their version of 
Permawash), which has an absolutely amazing shelf life (would you believe 1 
week in an open tray?!).  

 I assume the life of this toner is pretty decent, since there's no way to 
tell how long a bottle's been on the store shelf, but I have no idea whether 
any chemical reactions from these 2 being mixed shortens the shelf life.  
(I'm talking about using it after only one week's storage time, in a 
collapsible, nearly-airtight storage bottle.)

Thanks.

   Here is the problem. Wash aid is a solution of Sodium or Ammonium 
suflite. Sulfite is specific to the job. When exposed to air sulfite 
becomes sulfate. While sulfate won't hurt anything it is not nearly as 
effective as sulfite as a wash aid.
   Working solutions of wash aid are pretty diluted, they have a tray life 
of a few hours and not very much longer in a closed bottle. It makes no 
difference whether its a straight solution or if it has rapid selenium 
toner in it.
   The purpose of diluting KRST with wash aid is only for convenience when 
using KRST in very dilute solutions (1:20 or more). The capacity of the 
toner is pretty limited in these dilutions anyway.
   As I have posted before the Image Permanence Institute found that weak 
dilutions of Kodak Rapid Selenium Toner were ineffictive in preventing 
oxidation of microfilm images. They now recommend a solution similar to 
Kodak Brown Toner. Selenium _is_ effective if used in diltion of not 
greater than 1:9 and for not less than three minutes. At this dilution the 
toner should be mixed with plain (or distilled) water and the prints given 
a separate treatment in wash aid before toning. The wash aid adjusts the pH 
of the print to neutral or nearly so to avoid a deposit of elemental 
selenium from the toner. This can happen if the print or film is in acid 
condition. The print should be given another treatment in wash aid after 
toning to help wash out the toner, which is mostly ammonium thiosulfate 
(rapid fixer).

Do an author search for Nishimura, the paper will be among those on the list.

Lee:
	It's a single tube.  At one point, I replaced the tube with the model
that Aristo recommends for VC paper.  It produces a blue-green light,
with relatively short exposure times, as this seems to the wavelength
that the paper is sensitive to.  I assume when you say two tube that you
have separate control over the blue and green, so you don't even need
filters?  My whole set up, tube and drop in carrier with diffuser, and
separate power supply, cost about $150 new.  The true VC heads with dial
in contrast are about ten times that amount.
	For what it's worth, I seem to get the best results with a "backwards"
split filter technique, loosely derived from Fred Picker.  I use a 3, 4,
or 5 filter (depending on my assessment of the negative), and print for
a "minimum exposure for maximum black."  Then I look at the highlights,
and add exposure through a 0 or 1 filter until I have the highlight
texture that I want, frequently burning in dense areas, or holding back,
say, a face, while the 0 or 1 filter darkens the rest of the negative. 
When I read about "proper" technique, I frequently see the suggestion
that one expose for highlights, then add higher filtration until a true
black is achieved.  There are many paths to the mountain top.
	Regards,
	Phil
PS I went to the Aristo after testing my Beseler with no negative in the
carrier, exposing for an even grey with a number 5 filter.  The
resulting print showed wildly uneven tonality, when it should have been
an even grey.  Proper alignment on these machines is another long
story...

Firstly I wanted to afford Barry the courtesy of replying, which he has
done.  To add my own comments, I would say that having tried numerous
combinations of film/developer trying to squeeze the very last drop of
quality out of 35mm, I have settled on DiXactol and PANF or HP5 Plus,
with a plan to revisit FP4 Plus.  I can not compare with PMK as I have
not tried it but out of all the combinations tried I prefer DiXactol and
use it in single bath mode with Ilfospeed paper.  Barrie's suggested
times work fine for me with Grade 2.

Hope this helps.

Regards
Malcolm

DiXactol. DiXactol. I've been rolling this around on my tongue trying to
decide how it is pronounced. Is it


Die-zack-tall

Die-ack-stall

Die-gsack-tall

Die-eks-ack-tall

Die-Xtol (careful there)

Thanks for the input. I was not aware that anyone still uses resin paper. Wilhelm
research has very bad things to say about longevity and the resin papers.

I'm highly suspicious of anything Wilhelm researches now.  I recently
purchased an Epson 1270 printer primarily on the basis of his tests which
showed that prints made on Epson premium glossy paper lasted 9 years
without appreciable fading. Some users are now reporting that prints are
not lasting even as long as 9 hours.

On the other hand, my traditional RC prints (yes, many people use RC,
probably a much higher percentage than those who use fibre based paper)
have lasted for many years without any changes whatsoever.

Your joking right?   When was the last time you visited a camera store?
Next time you do, see how shelf space they devote to fibre paper, and
compare that to the space devoted to RC paper.  I was beginning to wonder
if anyone was still using fibre paper.

programs accept and use RC papers, with many photography majors getting a
degree without ever having printed on fibre papers.

All things being equal, there is no reason RC papers should NOT outlast
traditional fibre prints. Unfortunately, all is not equal. Each time the
makers have come to the table with the tale of "all is well with RC, the
bugs are worked out", another one surfaces & many who relied on the latest
round of promises end up eating it big time. Some labs go out of business &
some photographers spend thousands replacing yet another round of prints
that had the problem.

It doesn't happen to all who use RC. This last bit of brown
spotting/mirroring has shown up (or been recognized) in about 15-20% of the
prints that have been framed, even with the finest materials. That
percentage is still too high.

RC prints, done well, lose absolutely no ground to fibre prints and for many
look even better. High gloss, deep rich blacks and sparkling whites are
their hallmark. Checked out with reflection densitometers, these prints have
a greater range than fibre-unless the fibre paper is ferrotyped, a lost art
today.

The art world doesn't readily accept RC prints even when the same print is
done with both papers, matted, mounted and framed, and the veiwer cannot
tell them apart. One of these days it will change. With all the technology
available there is not a rational reason RC should take a back seat to fibre
for any reason other than the esthetics of surface, history or personal
preference. Certainly no valid scientific reason. RC suffers much less from
dimensional instability with its lower expansion and contraction in the wet
process as well as while on the mat board. Chemicals and pollutants cannot
migrate through the coated paper. The prints lie flat and using hinge or
float mounting is so much easier than with traditional papers.

Yet with all that, fibre reigns supreme in the darkrooms of those printing
for posterity and on museum and gallery walls.

It will be some time before RC is accepted and the industry has no one to
blame for that situation as they have not made a product that will last,
inspire confidence and fill the shelves of the highest quality printers.
That some prints last is fine, some with cars still drive 40 year old
models. But for this stuff to become the media of choice a lot will have to
change and that takes time.

We know fibre lasts...or at least the fibre done in the past has lasted.
Some of it, processed correctly and stored at least where it hasn't been
physically destroyed while at the same time the prints from those workers
who took shortcuts have faded just as the newest stuff will. Poorly
processed prints of fibre or RC won't last, we all know that. The newest
fibre papers may or may not last no matter what the tests say. With newer
paper formulations the tests and reality may be different, all we have to do
is wait another hundred or so years and see.

But, in the darkrooms of many fine printers we will continue to see fibre
paper in use for their prints. If for no other reason than 'how it looks',
it will be used. After all, "how it looks" is the whole basis for our images
and that is up to the photographic artist with the expertise to make a
rational and informed choice.

Aren't we expecting a lot? Expert/rational/informed choice? You mean go back to the old ways of doing things instead of- " it's new and improved and xyz uses it- I read it in his book"? I'm
just glad that I'm not the only one questioning Old Henry's information and/or conclusions.

Yes, I'm joking.  

Or perhaps nobody really is buying the stuff, and it's just piling up in
these stores taking up the space...  ;-)

This has me wondering,  how many problems did fibre based papers have when

I wonder if anyone has had the problems with Kodak RC Papers?
I've always used the fiber papers for fine art work -  just because in the
60's when I started selling prints it was the ONLY  acceptable paper.
 I use a roller transport for my RC prints and usually throw them away or
use them as proofs only. They never get mounted and due to personal
availability I've always used Kodak RC papers.
This is definitely not a Kodak advertisement but so far I have not seen the
Silvering/Bronzing problem with any Kodak papers. I end up at a lot of art
shows and am able to talk to folks about this and as of yet no Kodak paper
has been mentioned in the 'silvering/bronzing problems. I talked to a tech
rep at Kodak and they claim { note that I said "Claim" } that their papers
are not susceptible to the recent problems.
Just wondered what others had experienced?
I am waiting for Ilford to solve their problems due to the 50+ inch size
paper available in RC only. Now if they would just produce 54 inch fiber
paper!

  FWIW, back when Ctein first mentioned the bronzing problem several years
ago I made some test prints, two on Oriental VC-RP and two on Agfa MCP,
didn't tone them, and framed them. They've been hanging in the same place
since then.
  One of the Oriental prints developed spots a year or so ago, while none
of the others did. They were processed in the same batch, washed together
etc, exposed to the same light etc.
  And that's the only print of many RC prints I've had on display over the
years that's ever developed bronzing.
  Weird.

I have to agree that it is wierd. That, and quite embarassing when it
happens to a print one has sold to a client.

The biggest problem was/is that it is not an across the board problem. It
cropped up sporadically with no seeming rhyme or reason. With so many
excellent qualities RC paper is one I would love to use for some prints but
having been 'bit' twice by it, I stay clear.

You are right, I should be able to do this without entering 'commercial
mode'. Also, I had several other people asking me to snail mail them details
to addresses abroad. I'd like to, but the expense and time just becomes
prohibitive. So here goes with info. for all of you who are interested -
sorry I can't do this more personally. It's attached to this email as a Word
97 file called DiXactol & PMK. Open if you want to read it junk it if you
don't.

Dear Berry,
 I think it's still possible for you to enter into a
conversation/discussion of the qualities and process of using DiXactol
and to describe the comparison with PMK without being guilty of wrongly
extolling it's virtues, I trust you to keep your ego in check... even
so! I'd like to hear information and your experiences shared on this
list and I hope I am able to tell the difference between information
and a commercial. Personally I'd also like to know how this developer
compares in process and results when compared to PMK...  for one, is it
more or less as environmentally toxic? And even if someone did
interpreted your experienced comments as a commercial, I'd still value
them much more than a thousand "me too!" sponsorship posts. If
experianced and knowledgeable people fear to comment on this list, then
I am missing the intent of the list.
garimo

Hello All,
When I did my last B&W printing, about twenty years ago, I found no better
light source than cold light.  I'm including a dark room in the house we are
building later this year, and since the subject of light sources came up, I
thought I'd ask of anyone knows about it.  Are there any web sites thay sell
cold light heads?
Thanks,
John Pendley

Thanks Andrew. I know I sent a reply to a message that contained the virus
several days ago. Since that time I've brought my Norton anti virus program
as current as it can get and have sent messages that I don't believe were
infected with the virus so I thought everything was fine. Would you please
let me know if this message gives any indication of being infected? Thanks
again. Brian

Beautifully put. One other thing I'd like to see, or feel, in an RC paper is
the thickness of a top quality fibre base paper.
Incidentally, isn't RC fibre base too?

Subject:	Was DiXactol, now RC and Fibre papers

As we know, RC papers outsell fibre papers by a wide margin. Most school
programs accept and use RC papers, with many photography majors getting a
degree without ever having printed on fibre papers.

All things being equal, there is no reason RC papers should NOT outlast
traditional fibre prints. Unfortunately, all is not equal. Each time the
makers have come to the table with the tale of "all is well with RC, the
bugs are worked out", another one surfaces & many who relied on the latest
round of promises end up eating it big time. Some labs go out of business &
some photographers spend thousands replacing yet another round of prints
that had the problem.

It doesn't happen to all who use RC. This last bit of brown
spotting/mirroring has shown up (or been recognized) in about 15-20% of the
prints that have been framed, even with the finest materials. That
percentage is still too high.

RC prints, done well, lose absolutely no ground to fibre prints and for many
look even better. High gloss, deep rich blacks and sparkling whites are
their hallmark. Checked out with reflection densitometers, these prints have
a greater range than fibre-unless the fibre paper is ferrotyped, a lost art
today.

The art world doesn't readily accept RC prints even when the same print is
done with both papers, matted, mounted and framed, and the veiwer cannot
tell them apart. One of these days it will change. With all the technology
available there is not a rational reason RC should take a back seat to fibre
for any reason other than the esthetics of surface, history or personal
preference. Certainly no valid scientific reason. RC suffers much less from
dimensional instability with its lower expansion and contraction in the wet
process as well as while on the mat board. Chemicals and pollutants cannot
migrate through the coated paper. The prints lie flat and using hinge or
float mounting is so much easier than with traditional papers.

Yet with all that, fibre reigns supreme in the darkrooms of those printing
for posterity and on museum and gallery walls.

It will be some time before RC is accepted and the industry has no one to
blame for that situation as they have not made a product that will last,
inspire confidence and fill the shelves of the highest quality printers.
That some prints last is fine, some with cars still drive 40 year old
models. But for this stuff to become the media of choice a lot will have to
change and that takes time.

We know fibre lasts...or at least the fibre done in the past has lasted.
Some of it, processed correctly and stored at least where it hasn't been
physically destroyed while at the same time the prints from those workers
who took shortcuts have faded just as the newest stuff will. Poorly
processed prints of fibre or RC won't last, we all know that. The newest
fibre papers may or may not last no matter what the tests say. With newer
paper formulations the tests and reality may be different, all we have to do
is wait another hundred or so years and see.

But, in the darkrooms of many fine printers we will continue to see fibre
paper in use for their prints. If for no other reason than 'how it looks',
it will be used. After all, "how it looks" is the whole basis for our images
and that is up to the photographic artist with the expertise to make a
rational and informed choice.

Sorry, what's a cold light? (if i were to take a guess: something unlike
incandescent lamps which produce heat, but like discharge and florescent
lamps). Thanks,

Barry,

    RC is fibre base coated with a poly-something or other on both sides.
All those jokers who keep insisting the silver is coated with the 'plastic'
don't seem to realize the silver is on top of the 'plastic'. If it were
underneath, the developer couldn't get to the silver.

    There are some RC papers that look very nice for some images.

It is fiber base but has a plastic or resin coating (polyethylene) on both
sides of the fiber base.  >

In the school I just graduated from we were not allowed to ever turn in RC
prints if we were photo majors; the only ones who could were in the
beginning photo class if they had to take photo for another major, e.g. art.
I, also, only prefer RC for ease of use, and feel that the look of RC sucks.
But I have to say I don't print glossy, so maybe that is where RC excels.

     A really good article on this whole issue was written by Ctein in the
Mar/April issue of Photo Techniques magazine; some of the above may be
quoted from that perhaps, but anyway, it is worth getting a reprint of it.
After reading that I wouldn't even think of printing archivally on resin
coated papers.  I also have, on my wall, 4 wonderful prints done by a
reputable lab here in town about 6 or so years ago (before I got into
photography) that have all turned brown, spotty and ugly.  It's a great
reminder for me to never print anything other than contact sheets on RC
because I may run the risk of reprinting, and since I handcolor my black and
whites (and large ones at that) I'd be out mucho time..

Silly me:  I didn't put the year of the article in the last post; it is
Ctein's article, Are Black and White Resin Coated Papers as Permanent as
Fiber Papers?, Mar/Apr 1998.

All,

I beleive you can also refernce this information in his book "Post Exposure"
and there was a very long running thread in the Compuserve Photo Forum with
Ctein, so you may be able to reference that for more info.

        Try B&H They sell aristo Cold light heads or you can call the company
directly and speak to the guy that designs and builds them to get the one that
is best matched for your application.  The other thing to keep in mind is that
Ctein has done exhaustive testing and he feels that when the light sources are
balanced for contrast that there is no difference between using cold light,
incandescent, or a color head.

Here's Aristo's web site.  Products are also sold by the large
suppliers, B&H, Adorama, etc.
http://www.aristogrid.com/
I think a lot depends on how much you have to spend, and what you start
with.  If you have a color head, you're probably all set.  I found the
condensers on my Beseler just weren't giving even illumination.  The
drop in conversion from Aristo was about $150, a few years ago.  If I
had the $1,500 for a blue/green VC head, I would have done that.
	Once I went to the cold light, my need for spotting seemed to decrease,
even though I also went to a glass negative carrier (more surfaces keep
clean.)
	The cold light is a little white tube, mounted in a cylinder.  It's
bent around for better coverage, like a heating coil, (_)^(_) and the
bottom of the cylinder is a thick piece of milky diffuser, which sits
fairly close to the negative carrier.  The light is a blue/green, like
flourescent or neon, without much heat. (negative popping is a
non-issue.)
	A color head would give you the added advantage of dial-in intermediate
filter grades, and no below the lens filters.
	_Post Exposure_ by Ctien is an excellent reference.  With that and the
_Film and Development Cookbook_ you've got a great pair of guides to
producing good work.

Thanks Barry for the thoughtful response. I am a little curious as to why you
would see PMK as a better solution for 4x5. I have used PMK in a combi tank with
HP5 successfully, but I would enjoy that little increase in speed. With the
combo of HP5 and Dixactol, would you suggest one or 2 solution development?

DiXactol is fine in the Combi, especially withHP5 Plus. I don't think PMK is
better, just slightly different, and slightly cheaper I think - but I guess
that depends on where you buy each of the developers and whether you mix PMK
yourself. Personally, within reason, I don't think the cost of a film
developer is an issue compared to hardware and printing costs if we get the
result we want. No point in being penny-pinching unless we are on a really
tight budget.

Thanks Barry for the thoughtful response. I am a little curious as to why
you
would see PMK as a better solution for 4x5. I have used PMK in a combi tank
with
HP5 successfully, but I would enjoy that little increase in speed. With the
combo of HP5 and Dixactol, would you suggest one or 2 solution development?

I lately had the change to see a few sample books from various
Photographic Paper Factories from around 1920-1930, next to the
bewildering range of different papers (surfaces, colours in the baryta
layer)they had around than (oh company names: Mimosa, Geveart, Agfa, and
some more I forgot), there were quite a few fiber papers (these were
silver gelatine and silver collodium daylight papers as well as silver
gelatine enlargement papers with a baryta layer) were silvered out,
spotted, faded or mirrored. And selenium toning was definatly showing
its virue! These prints were still pristine.

Hi Andrew - Thanks. This was the third time in a couple months that I've =
inadvertantly sent out a worm. One of the problems is that Explorer 5.0 =
seems to automatically open messages. So even though Norton flags them, =
they seem to already be open. This is o.k. with viruses, since I never =
open attachments, but isn't so good with worms, which apparently get you =
just by opening the message. For now I've also gone to a Microsoft web =
site where they have a patch for this particular worm but I'm not sure =
that does any good for others in the future. Brian=20

Acer,
If you saw the recent post to Pure Silver avering that a dichroic head was
probably as good as cold light, I'd be slow to accept that.  First, I have
no experience with dichroic heads.  Second, Fred Picker, and old Ansel
disciple, swore that *nothing* beat cold light for smooth, subtle contrast
gradations.  That's the cold light hallmark: a baby-bottom smooth gray
scale.  Third, in my own experience with cold light, it was gorgeous,
blowing away two condenser heads (Beseler and Omega) and a Leitz Focomat;
with the Focomat, the difference wasn't as dramatic, but the cold light
still produced perceptibly better prints.  One thing that post did get right
is that cold light prints require less manipulation; that's because so much
more tonal information is retained.  You just don't get the glarey
highlights that condensers produce; you *do* get more detail in shadow
areas.  In fact, there were some negatives that simply could not be printed
with a condenser head due to blocked up areas around Zone 2-3; cold light
printed them with a minimum of dodging.  If you're interested in making the
very best B&W prints, the old fashioned wet darkroom way, this would be
worth some experimentation.  Maybe you have something to compare to already,
or maybe a friend does.  BTW, my best enlarger turned out to be an old (and
inexpensive) Omega B22 w/cold light head.  That machine made many beautiful
prints of negatives that were unprintable on anything else--shots into the
source of light, for instance.  The Beseler 23C never worked as well, and it
couldn't be aligned: there was no way to get the negative stage and the
easel parallel.
Regards,
John

Hi Les
Which of Ctein's testing methods are suspect? I'm interested because I have
something to say on some his findings in my new book.
Barry Thornton
You wrote "The comments about Ctein's views and tests are interesting. I
have the book and have read the article Christina referred too and gave to
say that I am not convinced by his findings. I know that he has a big
following in the states but have been told by a friend who  I trust and
respect that some of Ctein' testing methods are considered to be suspect by
many photographic researchers in this country (England). My friend works in
the research department at Ilford and is the man responsible for the
development of Ilford Warmtone paper so I feel that his credentials are
good. I am certain that he is not spouting the party line on the RC
longevity debate for I have had many long, interesting and open  debates
with him on the subject"

My experience from printing thousands of RC prints over the past 25 
years don't bear out the Ctein conclusions stated the Photo 
Techniques magazine.  I can remember only one print that showed 
silvering....a very early one when I was using Kodak paper.  Could 
have been sloppy processing on my part, but I have never seen the 
problem on many other prints I've made...collages for the fine arts 
market over this long period and many commercial prints over this 
same period.  In the past 10 years, I have been using Ilford products 
and a small bit of Agfa.

My feeling is that out there in photoland there is a strong fiber 
bias by a large segment of the fine arts / academic market and that 
is not going to go away anytime soon.  Nothing wrong with fiber 
paper....however it is not trouble free either.  Both products have 
their uses.  Same in the digital area.  You have to know the 
strengths and weaknesses of the output products and select the ones 
that make the most sense for your own work.

I'm not a great fan of RC paper but I have used it from time to time. I
think that where spots and faults appear on RC prints after a few
months/years, the problem can be traced to bad processing. I have a print
made on Ilfospeed 18 years ago by a friend which has been hanging on the
wall behind glass since it was made. There are no signs of any deterioration
or fading etc.,  I made my first prints 25 years ago on Ilfospeed and they
are still perfectly OK although it is fair to say that they have been stored
in print boxes and have not been displayed or exposed to light and
atmospheric pollution.
The comments about Ctein's views and tests are interesting. I have the book
and have read the article Christina referred too and gave to say that I am
not convinced by his findings. I know that he has a big following in the
states but have been told by a friend who  I trust and respect that some of
Ctein' testing methods are considered to be suspect by many photographic
researchers in this country (England). My friend works in the research
department at Ilford and is the man responsible for the development of
Ilford Warmtone paper so I feel that his credentials are good. I am certain
that he is not spouting the party line on the RC longevity debate for I have
had many long, interesting and open  debates with him on the subject.
I was interested in the comments about the considered similarities of RC and
fibre papers earlier in this thread. I have always considered fibre to be a
far superior paper in that I feel that it shows more depth and richness when
compared to the same image printed on RC paper. It's as if the image seems
to sink into the fibre of the paper which gives the depth, as against
sitting on the surface of RC paper. That is my way of describing the
difference. Logic says that both papers should produce the same result as
the emulsion is likely to be the same but I feel that the "plastic" of RC
prevents the "sinking in feeling". I consider myself to be a good printer
and I'm confident that I can identify the difference between a fibre and RC
print hanging on the wall.
Les McLean

     In a way I agree with this and disagree, too.  These views are not only
Ctein's, they are fact.  In the 70's this was happening and they found the
culprit to be the oxidation of titanium dioxide in the paper so they added
anti-oxidants.  The two basic problems were cracking of the resin and silver
image oxidation.  Then, the anti-oxidants produced yellow stain so different
anti-oxidants were added.  It seems that they got this problem all
corrected.  However, if Ctein is still talking about it in 1998, and that
article I just cited in this paragraph is from 1991 (NOT written by Ctein)
about 1970's problems, then there may be something to worry about.
Apparently the Rochester Institute of Technology has a dept that
investigates image permanence, so they would be a better, more unbiased
source to check with, and certainly more knowledgeable than I am.  However,
none of this has been a problem with fiber, right?
     One thing I find very damaging to research of this sort is when one
says that the testing is "suspect".  When I hear that, I immediately lose
credibility in the research, and is that right?  I mean, if this is an
observable phenomenon, anecdotal perhaps if you will, it is actually
occurring and shouldn't that make us be cautious about selling supposedly
archival prints?
Can we rely on the hope that it is just 'lousy processing' and the fault of
the photographer?  If it is just 'lousy processing' then why is it not
observable on fiber papers?  Ctein wasn't the only one who said all this; so
did Henry Wilhelm.  And now, on another photo list I am on, Wilhelm research
is being dissed left and right as being "suspect".
     The bottom line is I do not want to worry about my prints once they
leave my studio.  And, I agree with Les totally that with the look of RC
being inferior, there is no reason to use it for archival prints anyway
(unless you are unlucky enough to not have a mounting press; I seal mount
all my work because it lays flat and smooth and sturdy for handcoloring.)

There have been several articles in recent years, one Iin particular that I
remember in Photo Techniques magazine (perhaps under its old name) that
pretty well scotched the idea that cold light heads  produce iherently
better prints than condensers. Prints that require less spotting, yes,
prints that show scratches less, yes, but otherwise "better," no. As long as
a negative is properly processed for the type of enlarger being used (i.e.
basically lto a higher contrast for a negative that is to be processed on a
cold light head because of the head's lower contrast) these articles have
demonstrated, at least to my satisfaction, that Ansel Adams was wrong, as
was Fred Picker. (who was simply parroting Adams).

The problem supposedly was that Adams would take one of his negatives that
had been processed to a density range suitable for the cold light head  he
used (i.e. to a higher contrast in order to compensate for the lower
contrast of a cold light head) and then print it on a condenser (high
contrast) enlarger. Naturally, since the negative had been processed at a
high contrast and then was printed on a high contrast enlarger it produced
the "soot and chalk" look that Adams then assumed was inherent with
condenser enlargers. The print did look bad but  not because cold light
heads are inherently superior but rather because the negative had been
processed to a density range suitable for a cold light head (i.e. higher
contrast than required for a condenser head) and then printed  on a
condenser (high contrast) enlarger.

 The key is to process the negative based upon the type of enlarger head
being used.  I don't have the citation to the article I have in mind handy
but if anyone has access to back issues of "Photo Techniques" magazine and
wishes to pursue this let me know and I'll dig it out. ----- Original

soapbox warning:

I know Tim wants to keep this list as open as possible, and I respect that.
However, mailing lists are really no place for attachments. Many email
listservers automatically strip such things as attachments and html,
something I'm much in favor of.  Many of us either a) cant read them, b)
dont want to read them, c) cant even download attachments thanks to crummy
ISP's, d) have to go searching 4-5 folders deep to find them and then
delete them when we do get unsolicited attachments, e) most or all of the
above. I can see where occasionally an attachment might be helpful to some,
but for the very most part whatever can be said in an attachment can be
said as text in the body of the email. I'm sure you've all heard of cut and
paste?

Fire away.

Is there any quantitative information on cold light sources?  

I am willing to believe there is a difference between condensor and
diffusion light heads because of the Callier effect. There is also
a point-source light head that not commonly used.

But a cold light head IS a diffusion light head, albeit with a
different kind of light (flourescent, rather than incandescent).

So any effects would seem to be related to

(a) different color spectrum [this usually works against cold-light
because VC filters are based on an incandescent spectrum, requiring
special new cold-light bulbs etc.)

(b) uniformity of illumination "no hot spots" in case you had such
a problem with your incandenscent head.

(c) no heat/ more headroom/long lamp life  [should be unrelated to
the quality of the print]

So when someone says a negative was unprintable except with a
cold light head, I wonder what that could mean. On the same contrast
paper?
Maybe all that is needed is a lower contrast paper.

For info from the Aristo people. see
http://www.aristogrid.com/coldlight.html

Notice that in their comparison diagrams, there is a diffuser sheet
between the light source and the negative.

Eric,

There is a saying that goes, "the best way to make a small fortune in the
airline business is to begin with a large fortune!". So with that I have to
salute anyone that thinks they can make a go with a new photo magazine. I
think the success of Lens Work (formerly Lens Work Quarterly), View Camera,
Camera Arts, and Black and White (as well as editions such as PFJ, Collodion
Journal, etc.) proves that there is a niche market for high quality
photography magazines. I hope they all are successful. The dilemma for me
and other readers is the allocation of disposable income that we have to
spend on eye and brain candy. Lets face it. With each subscription or
magazine purchase less money is left for buying raw materials for my own
work.

Just a few random thoughts ...

Don Bryant

P.S. If you aren't viewing/reading it already Art on Paper is also another
high end magazine that deals with fine art photography. There are others
too, such as "Shots" :>)

Unfortunately, stating that properly controlled measured and verifiable and
repeatable results are 'suspect' without producing counter evidence and data
is an age-old method of destroying credibility of research - often by large
organisations protecting their commercial interests. I have already replied
to Les McLean about this, and I am sure he will get some information out of
Ilford to back up their comments.
Incidentally, many people claim that they can easily tell the difference
between RC and fibre base when matted and framed under glass. Ilford's
people told me when running master classes for them that they had run
exactly that test with top printers and photographers, and they couldn't
tell the difference between their Pearl finish RC and unglazed glossy fibre
base. I think if we had to undergo that test, we might not be as good as we
think at discriminating the two in these circumstances. Probably
It wouldn't be the image quality that would enable us to see the difference,
but the colour of the paper base. I find many RC papers too bright a white -
pretty unsubtle.
I prefer the feel of fibre base paper, and have reservations about RC
durability. In 1997 my much loved dog died. In grief, I made a print of one
of the few negatives I had of him on Agfa Multicontrast Premium, untoned,
but processed deliberately in totally fresh chemistry with carefully
complete wash. The print hangs, glass framed, on my office wall with
fluorescent lighting. I live and work in a quiet country area. One year
later on the anniversary of his death, I looked closely at the print and was
shocked to see that the print had developed bronzing in the shadows. No
hassle. I still have the neg ad can reprint on fibre. But I have kept the RC
print on the wall as an example to workshop students, and also to observe if
there was further deterioration. Surprisingly, there doesn't appear to have
been a noticeable amount.
This is poor evidence since I don't have control samples on other materials,
or displayed in different ways. But there is a problem with bronzing on RC,
and don't have enough information on it to make decisions for archival
printing.

Barry Thornton
     In a way I agree with this and disagree, too.  These views are not only
Ctein's, they are fact.  In the 70's this was happening and they found the
culprit to be the oxidation of titanium dioxide in the paper so they added
anti-oxidants.  The two basic problems were cracking of the resin and silver
image oxidation.  Then, the anti-oxidants produced yellow stain so different
anti-oxidants were added.  It seems that they got this problem all
corrected.  However, if Ctein is still talking about it in 1998, and that
article I just cited in this paragraph is from 1991 (NOT written by Ctein)
about 1970's problems, then there may be something to worry about.
Apparently the Rochester Institute of Technology has a dept that
investigates image permanence, so they would be a better, more unbiased
source to check with, and certainly more knowledgeable than I am.  However,
none of this has been a problem with fiber, right?
     One thing I find very damaging to research of this sort is when one
says that the testing is "suspect".  When I hear that, I immediately lose
credibility in the research, and is that right?  I mean, if this is an
observable phenomenon, anecdotal perhaps if you will, it is actually
occurring and shouldn't that make us be cautious about selling supposedly
archival prints?
Can we rely on the hope that it is just 'lousy processing' and the fault of
the photographer?  If it is just 'lousy processing' then why is it not
observable on fiber papers?  Ctein wasn't the only one who said all this; so
did Henry Wilhelm.  And now, on another photo list I am on, Wilhelm research
is being dissed left and right as being "suspect".
     The bottom line is I do not want to worry about my prints once they
leave my studio.  And, I agree with Les totally that with the look of RC
being inferior, there is no reason to use it for archival prints anyway
(unless you are unlucky enough to not have a mounting press; I seal mount
all my work because it lays flat and smooth and sturdy for handcoloring.)

soapbox warning:

I know Tim wants to keep this list as open as possible, and I respect that.
However, mailing lists are really no place for attachments. Many email
listservers automatically strip such things as attachments and html,
something I'm much in favor of.  Many of us either a) cant read them, b)
dont want to read them, c) cant even download attachments thanks to crummy
ISP's, d) have to go searching 4-5 folders deep to find them and then
delete them when we do get unsolicited attachments, e) most or all of the
above. I can see where occasionally an attachment might be helpful to some,
but for the very most part whatever can be said in an attachment can be
said as text in the body of the email. I'm sure you've all heard of cut and
paste?

Fire away.

Here here!
Cold light enlarging is one of the archetypal photographic old chestnuts.
See Dr. Richard Henry's research in 'Controls in Black and White
Photography'. Recently, Ctein has published further articles in Photo
Techniques (Jan and Mar 1999) saying that cold light was superior. He made
the same mistake of using a negative developed for cold light. He also
claimed that there was no difference in sharpness between condenser and cold
light, but then contradicted the definition he used for sharpness in his
book 'Post Exposure'. I diametrically disagree with this, and show the
evidence in my forthcoming book.
The trouble with the proponents of either condenser or cold light is that
they often have to defend their own purchasing decision. For the record,
Ctein found that evenness of lighting was not inferior with condenser, and
that cold light prints and light box diffuser prints are indistinguishable.
What is true is that it is probably possible to develop an N-2 negative for
cold light/diffuser, while the reduction in development time necessary
probably rules this out for condenser printing with many film types.
Conversely, you could get N+2 for condenser printing, but probably not with
diffuser. However, the need for this is obviously far less frequent than
N-2.

Subject:	Re: cold light? Re: Bulbs and VC light source, printing method/
Virus

There have been several articles in recent years, one Iin particular that I
remember in Photo Techniques magazine (perhaps under its old name) that
pretty well scotched the idea that cold light heads  produce iherently
better prints than condensers. Prints that require less spotting, yes,
prints that show scratches less, yes, but otherwise "better," no. As long as
a negative is properly processed for the type of enlarger being used (i.e.
basically lto a higher contrast for a negative that is to be processed on a
cold light head because of the head's lower contrast) these articles have
demonstrated, at least to my satisfaction, that Ansel Adams was wrong, as
was Fred Picker. (who was simply parroting Adams).

The problem supposedly was that Adams would take one of his negatives that
had been processed to a density range suitable for the cold light head  he
used (i.e. to a higher contrast in order to compensate for the lower
contrast of a cold light head) and then print it on a condenser (high
contrast) enlarger. Naturally, since the negative had been processed at a
high contrast and then was printed on a high contrast enlarger it produced
the "soot and chalk" look that Adams then assumed was inherent with
condenser enlargers. The print did look bad but  not because cold light
heads are inherently superior but rather because the negative had been
processed to a density range suitable for a cold light head (i.e. higher
contrast than required for a condenser head) and then printed  on a
condenser (high contrast) enlarger.

 The key is to process the negative based upon the type of enlarger head
being used.  I don't have the citation to the article I have in mind handy
but if anyone has access to back issues of "Photo Techniques" magazine and
wishes to pursue this let me know and I'll dig it out. ----- Original

Don,  Yes, I have heard of the magazine.  I have been in contact with them
about doing some articles for products that may be of interest to the pure
silver and alternative printing communities.  I believe that they are still
planing on a mid July premiere.

Hello Richard,
It's unfortunate that I mistakenly sent a message to the entire list when I
intended it for Acer (whom I know from another list) .  Since I did, though,
I expect posts such as this one inquiring (politely) about proof.  (I
appreciate the links.)  It is probable that every single member of this list
knows more about the way enlargers work than I do.  So, although it may seem
lame, I can only say that my conclusions are based on experience.  There is
nothing in my original post that I did not experience myself, and not much
that I can explain scientifically.  Also, my experience is at least twenty
years old.  But when I go back to darkroom work, it will be with a cold
light head.
Regards,
John

The proof of the pudding is in the eating...
If you like your results with cold light, 
that's fine; I just react to statements
suggesting that two 
items are different (even vastly different)
when they could be objectively measured.
(For example, printing a calibrated
gray scale, or a resolution test).

Cold light seems like a hassle. Temperature
of the light or the ballast, delay to turn
on, different variable contrast steps...

Few of us have the patience to make the
best possible print under different 
conditions and compare them, so if cold
light makes your life easier, go for it
before we are all wiped out by digital
printers.


Best regards,
RJF

I have not done testing myself but have recently heard that several folks
are testing the differences found in Cold light verses standard dicro color
heads. There might be a slight difference in the highlight separation,
favoring the Dicro/diffusion heads. I talked to a photographer that claimed
that John Sexton may have switched for this reason. { if I knew him I would
ask myself.... :o) }  I believe that the lights wavelengths are what is in
question. Knowing the rumor mill spreads way too much false info I am
wondering if anyone else has any info on this? Is there any logical reason
the highlights would separate better with the difference in light
wavelengths?

 I've built a couple of Dicro heads and have found that there is a
difference between the diffusion material used in the final diffusion.  My
latest version uses an "Opal" or flashed glass diffuser as opposed to the
milky white Plexiglas { not sure of the European equivalent.}  The opal
glass seems to be more diffuse and needs more development for the same
tones. { very slight. ... the same test neg printed on MGIV- no filter read
on my densitometer was about 5points apart overall }  This leads me to
believe that there might be more difference in the diffuser than in the
different types of light source. This could also be explained by transmitted
light color or some other factor I haven't  thought of.  I have about .33
{1/3} stop light loss at the edges that has to be masked with the opal glass
as opposed to .5 {1/2} stop with the Plexiglas when they are interchanged.
In some cases cold light tubes spread light better but with slight masking
or in diffusers like Beseler uses { actually thicker in the center} the
differences in evenness is not measurable { to me} when using my spotmeter
to read off the surface. Both can be brought to less than 1/10 of a stop
variance across the diffusion plate {if my meters can be trusted}.

Thanks,
Chuck Downs
{ my apologies for the Fardog email address
but the spammers haven't found my dog's name interesting yet....:o) }

I have four enlargers. The Valloy and Focomat are archetypal 
condenser enlargers. The Beseler 45 has a condenser head and a Dichro 
45S color diffusion head. I also have the original Kodak Flourlite A 
cold light enlarger given to me by a neighbor when I was in High 
School. After reading Ctein's articles I experimented by printing the 
same test neg in all five setups using the same Nikor lens. As Ctein 
said, sharpness remained the same when contrast and the gamma of the 
neg were disregarded. I printed a higher contrast 6X9 neg suitable 
for cold light with both the cold light and the Dichroic heads. I 
used graded paper #2. What surprised me was that there was a 
difference in the prints when a mid-tone density was matched. The 
cold light prints had what appeared to be a softer look and there was 
more shadow detail. Was it "better"? Is Dijon better than French's? 
Only the guys in the Rolls' know for sure.

What is indisputable is the merciless quality of revealing every 
scratch, spot, and bit of atmospheric particles on the film when 
printed with a condenser system. The Leitz condenser enlargers are 
major offenders in this regard. Much of the problem, IMO, is caused 
by the condenser surface in contact with the neg and the optional 
glass carrier. I find it very difficult to keep all surfaces dust 
free. However, glass carriers really do make a difference in 
sharpness out to the corners of the print. When I use a glass carrier 
in the Beseler 45 the improvement is at least as great as it is in 
the Leitz. There are still four glass surfaces to clean but the minor 
defects in the negative surface don't show.

Some day I'm going to pick up an orphan dichroic head at a swap meet 
and cobble it on to the Valloy or Focomat. There once was a kit to 
put a Chromega head on the Focomat. The fixed mechanical relationship 
between the negative carrier and the lens on the Leitz enlargers 
eliminates most alignment problems for good. That should result in a 
bulletproof enlarger with color and variable contrast capabilities. 
Of course, there's always the Focomat V35 which solved all these 
problems at significant expense.

Good points, I'll remeber those when I tell my SO that I need a new

Oh BTW did you get your B&J 11x14 on EBAY? If so how is it?

Ah, but what happens when you develop a negative less to the correct density
range of the negative for the condenser enlarger and print that on grade 2?
That's what you actually do in real life. Then you will find that the prints
from each enlarger light source match. Yet the condenser print will look
sharper. By the way, Ctein's method of showing sharpness in the prints was
illogical. Giant blow-ups of tiny negative portions do not show comparative
sharpness. If the condenser shows dust and hairs sharper, it's going to show
the neg sharper too!
Incidentally, I use diffuser, single condenser, double condenser, and small
light source double condenser enlargers as appropriate for the subject. I
know each of these prints sharper in this sequence by controlled experiment.

Subject:	RE: cold light? and enlargers

I have four enlargers. The Valloy and Focomat are archetypal
condenser enlargers. The Beseler 45 has a condenser head and a Dichro
45S color diffusion head. I also have the original Kodak Flourlite A
cold light enlarger given to me by a neighbor when I was in High
School. After reading Ctein's articles I experimented by printing the
same test neg in all five setups using the same Nikor lens. As Ctein
said, sharpness remained the same when contrast and the gamma of the
neg were disregarded. I printed a higher contrast 6X9 neg suitable
for cold light with both the cold light and the Dichroic heads. I
used graded paper #2. What surprised me was that there was a
difference in the prints when a mid-tone density was matched. The
cold light prints had what appeared to be a softer look and there was
more shadow detail. Was it "better"? Is Dijon better than French's?
Only the guys in the Rolls' know for sure.

What is indisputable is the merciless quality of revealing every
scratch, spot, and bit of atmospheric particles on the film when
printed with a condenser system. The Leitz condenser enlargers are
major offenders in this regard. Much of the problem, IMO, is caused
by the condenser surface in contact with the neg and the optional
glass carrier. I find it very difficult to keep all surfaces dust
free. However, glass carriers really do make a difference in
sharpness out to the corners of the print. When I use a glass carrier
in the Beseler 45 the improvement is at least as great as it is in
the Leitz. There are still four glass surfaces to clean but the minor
defects in the negative surface don't show.

Some day I'm going to pick up an orphan dichroic head at a swap meet
and cobble it on to the Valloy or Focomat. There once was a kit to
put a Chromega head on the Focomat. The fixed mechanical relationship
between the negative carrier and the lens on the Leitz enlargers
eliminates most alignment problems for good. That should result in a
bulletproof enlarger with color and variable contrast capabilities.
Of course, there's always the Focomat V35 which solved all these
problems at significant expense.

Don,  I thought that was just an expression that we used in Taos.  Many people
moved there with the idea of starting some great art gallery or store only to go
belly up.

As for the magazine, I have no financial stake in the magazine.  If I can make
any money by sharing my photographic expertise and knowledge, great.  It would
not be my sole source of income : )

And yes, there are many publications out there.  it is quite possible that the
publishers believe that they have put together a team that will make this
magazine interesting enough to establish a following.   If the cost of a
subscription is the difference between making prints and not, I would certainly
tell you to buy the box of paper.  Hopefully the information contained within
the pages of a publication will save you that much by eliminating some trial and
error that you might otherwise engage in. It may even give you some insight that
opens the door to that image that sells or opens your heart and mind in such a
way as to brighten your life as well as others that view your work

Cheers

excuse my ignorance on such matters, but how could you tell the post was =
infected? I use Norton and I opened Brian messages. They opened OK and I =
didn't receive any warnings - and nothing nasty seems to have happened =
yet!

    Thanks Andrew. I know I sent a reply to a message that contained the =
virus several days ago. Since that time I've brought my Norton anti =
virus program as current as it can get and have sent messages that I =
don't believe were infected with the virus so I thought everything was =
fine. Would you please let me know if this message gives any indication =
of being infected? Thanks again. Brian

Tim
Thank you so much for being honest and displaying your ignorance.  I'm =
not even sure I know what a worm virus is (Oh yes, I am sure - I don't =
know!) and is a worm virus different from a kakworm virus?
BTW, I'm your daughter's boss and I don't want to sack her after hearing =
you lecture!!!!

Yes please Barry.  I can't read Word 97 either, and as Wayne says,
attachments aren't the best way because many people can't receive / open them.

While on the subject of "Netiquette" *please* can posters quote only
*relevant* bits of previous posts?  I'm getting a bit tired of three line

  I would like to second this. Attachments are trouble on mailing lists. So 
is HTML. HTML doubles or tripples the size of messages. e-mail should be 
plain text.
  Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express install with the settings defaulted 
to HTML, they should be changed. I beleive Netscape mail also defaults to 
HTML on installation. Even the new version of Eudora is defaults to 
returning HTML in HTML, that should also be disabled.
  Its also a good idea to disable the ability of Outlook, OE, and Eudora to 
run VB scripes automatically. This will keep you from being a victim of the 
new VB script worms. Its easy to disable in Eudora, not so easy in the MS 
stuff.
   Sometime check your e-mail using a simple terminal program like the 
Telnet program in Windows or Hyperterminal. Those things will show you 
exactly what is coming in. HTML stuff can be totally unreadable and the 
received files are huge.

This is the equivalent of blaming the parents when kids turn out to be
rotten.

The problems exist. They happen even to those who are careful printers using
good technique all the way through the process.

That they don't appear with each print is a real puzzler. Ctein and other
have found the silvering/brown spotting problems show up in framed prints,
and a small percentage of those at that. But, even a small percentage is too
much, especially if one has been selling the images to clients, collectors,
galleries, etc. If the problems show up with ONE client, do you call all
those who bought the prints & re-do each one on the off chance others will
develop the problems shortly even if they haven't shown up yet?

RC is too expensive right now if it requires reprinting and replacing after
the images are in the hands of clients.

   I strongly recommend that those interested in the permanence of prints 
read the material available on the Conservation On Line site, particularly 
the articles and letters by Douglas Nishmura. 
http://www.palimpsest.stanford.edu
   There are also two papers on Thom Bell's web site which are must 
reading: http://www.geocities.com/thombell/

   On Thom Bell's site see:
(1) _Archival Aspects of Resin Coated Papers_ James M. Reilly

(2) _Oxidative Fading of B&W Photographs, What Is It?_ Annonomous, Ilford 
Corp.

   At the Conservation On Line site see in particular:

(1) "Stability of Black-And-White Phtoograph8ic Images, with Special 
Reference to Microfilm" James M. Reilly, et. al. _Abbey News Letter_ Vol. 
12, Number 5 July 1988

(2) "How Stable are Photos on RC Paper" Douglas Nishimura  Abbey News 
Letter Vol 21, Number 4, November 1997

(3) Perform a name search for "Nishimura" for various letters and articles 
written to the Photo History list and to the Abbey Newsletter which are 
archived on the Conservation On Line site.
In them Dr. Nishimura discusses problems with overwashing of fiber prints 
and stability of film base. A small residue of thiosulfate acts as a 
passivating agent preventing oxidation of the silver.

   Very briefly, the problem Ctein wrote about turned out to be due to 
production of oxidizing gasses by the Titanium Dioxide used as the 
reflecttive material under the emulsion of RC paper. Current paper contains 
scavengers for the gasses and anti-oxidants. The problem with older RC 
paper was exacerbated when the prints were mounted under very closely 
fitting glass or plastic covers which caused the gas to become concentrated 
at the surface.
   Dr. Nishmura writes that while these scavengers are effective they may 
not have infinite life so that in the long run fiber is still a better 
choice for prints which are to be _displayed_.
   The redox process which results in both fading and discoloration of 
images, and in the production of silver oxide film, often refered to as 
"bronzing" can be eliminated by proper toning in a sulfiding toner.
   The importance of correct fixing can not be overstressed. Unless the 
reactions of fixing process are completed some insoluable reaction products 
will be left in the emulsion. One exposed to air, these reaction products 
will rapidly change into a form will attack the image, and can not be 
removed by subsequent fixing in a fresh fixer. These reactions take place 
within a few days. The use of a two bath fixing regime is the best 
preventive of this problem.
   The difference in life of prints otherwise processed similarly may be 
due, at least in part, to differences in fixing procedures.
  At the moment there is no clear replacement for the frequently 
recommended toning in highly diluted Kodak Rapid Selenium toner. Dr. 
Nishimura wrote me that Selenium was effective as an image prtectant 
providing the toning was carried out far enough to tone the low density 
areas of the image. His recommendation for toning paper for permanence in 
KRST was to use a dilution of not greater than 1:9 and tone for a minimum 
of three minutes. This will cause a definite change in image color and 
density in many papers. Toning at the usual 1:20 will not tone the less 
dense areas enough to protect them from redox and sulfiding reactions.
   Full toning in any Sulfiding toner or in Selenium toner results in a 
permanent image. Very slight toning in Kodak Brown Toner will also result 
in permanent images.
   There has been a problem in the past with some RC papers which have 
developer layers incorporated in them. Most RC paper have such a layer to 
allow their development in "activation" type processers. In the past some 
developer incorporated paper has developed a stain due to developer 
residue. This is not a problem in paper without the developer layer. It is 
claimed that current developer incorporated paper also does not have a problem.

   I will add as a note that I have many times made duplicate prints on RC 
and fiber papers with similar surfaces and image tones. Its hard to tell 
them apart when they are mounted. It is IMHO perfrectly possible to make 
fine prints on RC. If it has a drawback it is the doubt about very long 
time image life and in physical handling quality, the latter not a problem 
when mounted prints are considered.

Richard,
     When you 'snip' your letters that you reply to, watch that you keep the
correct author with the correct comments.  I did not write the comments
below.  Les did.  Maybe this is a picky point, but I do think 'netiquette'
is important to keep opinions belonging to the right persons....

Here's the text of the attachment I sent. Sorry I did that everybody. It was
thoughtless.

Barry Thornton

First of all - DiXactol is pronounced Dye-Zaktol. The stem is Exactol,
shortened to Xactol; then Di in front for the two bath.
Secondly, PMK is a fine developer and I am not knocking it! Gordon Hutchings
was one of the first people to contact me with congratulations on DiXactol.
It's complementary to PMK, not intended as a replacement.
DiXactol uses Catechol (with a very small amount of Glycin) as the
developing agent, PMK uses a combination of Pyro and metol. I do not know
the precise comparisons of Catechol and Pyro in terms of environmental
unfriendliness. They both come from the hydroquinone family, and I suspect
there would be little difference between them in terms of human toxicity.
However, there is much less catechol in a litre of working solution of
DiXactol than there is pyro in a similar amount of PMK.
The human toxicity problem is not usually due to absorption through the
skin, though. Many people wear gloves during processing, but a splash on the
hands promptly rinsed off in clean water is really not a risk. Breathing in
the powder definitely is. That's not a consideration if you buy DiXactol
because it's ready-mixed. It could be if you mix PMK yourself. The make-up
of catechol is almost like brown sugar - there is little powder 'float'.
Even so, while making it, I take great precautions. Pyro powder does float
in the air more easily, so proportionately greater care is needed.
Take care if you buy PMK ready-mixed that it is genuinely PMK. Getting all
the Kodalk to dissolve is a challenge, and some suppliers I have come across
cheat - not Photographers' Formulary I emphasise.
In terms of performance, DiXactol tans more strongly than PMK. You can
actually see the image standing in relief on the emulsion side of the film
if you hold it at the correct oblique angle to the light. This makes for
even greater compensation than PMK in the highlights. Couple this with the
fact that DiXactol can be used as a two bath with even greater highlight
restraint, and you have a developer where you can really give any film,
virtually, the same development time and get fine printable negatives. Some
would be a little flat needing harder paper - Delta 400 for one.
PMK stains more in general. Though it is more variable in this than
DiXactol. For instance, I find that T-Max 100 stains better in DiXactol.
BUT, the stain colour is very different. PMK is definitely yellowish.
DiXactol is a rich brown.
Sometimes the yellow PMK stain would be an advantage, sometimes not. Much is
made of the fact that this yellow colour, stronger in the highlights,
automatically gives a softened grade of paper selectively in these areas of
a VC print as though this is always "a good thing". If, say, we were
photographing an architectural interior with a bright backlit window in
shot, it almost certainly would be a good thing to enable the window detail
to print. In a landscape, however, with glorious white clouds, it might make
them easier to print, but they would look muddy and separation would not be
good enough - the print would not gleam. Obviously, on a graded paper, the
PMK yellow stain would act purely as printing density, and we Could get far
more contrast in the clouds than we want.
DiXactol's brown stain still acts as printing density on VC papers as well
as graded, so that gleam in the clouds doesn't go, but because of the
tanning compensation, they can still be burned in beautifully with good
separation. Even with DiXactol ,there is a hint of yellow in the stain, so
VC tends to print a little softer than graded, but it is much more
consistent in printing characteristics than PMK across papers, and the
amount/colour of stain is also more consistent across films. The end result
is that you can develop negatives less in DiXactol if you intend  printing
on VC because you don't have to overcome the stain-softening effect. That
makes for greater sharpness, and more easily burned in highlights. Films
with bullet-proof highlights like TMX print much more easily with subtle
separation there.
Printing on graded and VC gives subtle differences with DiXactol, but can
give big differences with PMK. Sometimes one is an advantage, sometimes the
other. But it is true that, if using PMK you may well have to give different
development times for  printing on graded or VC  paper. Not with DiXactol.
You give one time and print to taste afterwards.
PMK gives finer grain than DiXactol - which can be important if you
consistently work with fast film in 35mm. DiXactol gives more speed - about
Å1/2 stop - than PMK. So while you might use Delta 100 in 35mm at EI64 in PMK,
you can use a genuine 100 in DiXactol, and grain won't be a problem in your
print.
In medium or large format try HP5 Plus. Just as with PMK, this film gives
optimum stain, and its apparent sharpness is tops too.
DiXactol is definitely sharper. In fact this is its dominant characteristic.
The adjacency effects are quite remarkable. Yes, even for those people used
to ultra-dilute Rodinal.
The cost can become high with DiXactol in two bath - sorry it's just the
cost of the raw materials. Single bath gives slightly greater sharpness and
tanning as well as greater economy. The development time is just about the
same in single bath for all applicable films (not suitable for ultra speed
films like Delta/T-Max 3200, or  Tech. Pan etc. - Tech Pan with higher
dilution may well be worth exploration though) about 8 minutes according to
your enlarger light source and favourite paper. Compensation, though is not
as good as two bath. Unlike PMK which needs frequent agitation to avoid
unevenness, you can use partial stand development with DiXactol to increase
compensation to about the same level as two bath  and give even greater
sharpness by enhanced adjacency effects. Simply agitate continuously for the
first 30 seconds, rapping the tank to get rid of air bells, then let stand
for two minutes between agitation thereafter. Increase total development
time a little to compensate.
DiXactol's base fog performance is not as good as PMK. With some films it is
unacceptable. I have been trying out a lot of Verichrome Pan recently, and
got bad fog in DiXactol whereas PMK gave a beautifully clean negative. I am
still working to cure this one.
Like any tanning/staining developer, DiXactol is fussy about its processing
conditions. The quality of water supply is always an issue. Changing
agitation routine will not cure this. If in doubt, as with PMK, use purified
or distilled water. Bad water will give swirls of unevenness.
DiXactol is not as fussy about agitation as PMK, but it is very sensitive to
contamination. If you use reels that have previously been used for other
processing, the first time you may well get marking or swirls at the edge of
the negatives. The first use of DiXactol seems to cure this however -
obviously it's a brilliant reel cleaner! But if you have both poor water and
contaminated reels, it gets difficult to diagnose the fault. Single bath is
always less sensitive than two bath with these challenges.
PMK, I gather, is OK with rotary processing. DiXactol doesn't like it. You
throw away those valuable edge effects and some of the compensation. If you
are prepared to sacrifice this, and some people are, if you use it with the
usual small working solution amounts for rotary processing, the early
oxidisation due to the small amount and continuous 'churning' can cause
stains and streaking, and flat negs. Use not less than 600ml per pair of
35mm/120 films or pair of 5x4 sheets to overcome this.
5x4 users will get best results with a Combi tank with inversion agitation -
and they can use partial stand development too. 6 sheets of 5x4 are nicely
developed in 1200ml solution. Even so, I think PMK is the more accommodating
solution for sheet film users. I think it's a bit cheaper too, though that
depends on here you buy it and whether you mix it yourself.
I think that's about all. Sorry to go on for so long. Those of you who
didn't want to know about DiXactol shouldn't have got this far before
hitting the delete key. Those of you who did, thanks for hanging in.

Hello Joe !
As a "Pure-Silver" subscriber, I've got your message pertaining to the
"KAK" worm virus.
Such viruses are spread, unfortunatelly, by people like you, using HTML
to compose and send Email.
One of the best method to prevent them is to use "plain text" for mail
messages, which, by the way, helps others to read such messages, folks
not using "top of the line" mail readers or not using PC hardware.
Of course, I'm not saying that such viruses come from you, and as I use
a Unix variant to read, send email, I do not have any anti virus
software, relying to the operating system to be virus safe, and I do
sugest you, if you're hit often by viruses, to ask your correspondent to
switch to plain text for email, and even switch to Linux or FreeBSD
operating systems.
Hope this will help !

Hello  Mr Thornton !
What is the "winmail.dat" file you join too your messages ?
Above this is a "carbon copy" of what I've seen on my screen opening
your Pure Silver message.
I've no way to figure what is/will be the file you joined. Is it a Virus
;) or your bussiness card ?
May I kindly suggest that you revert to "plain text" without
attachements when you post on the pure Silver mailling list ?
Best regards

Hi Peter,
Well well, the world is a small place!
I presume you are referring to Smethwick?
I made that comment as I knew her boss at  the time was in the audience. =
His name is Trevor - so who are you ???

Back to the worm - perhaps Don can pick up my query??

Les (and others ofcourse!),

I once heard that Ilford Warmtone isn't so much a chlorobromide paper
(the usual way to make a (mildly) warm paper versus silverchloride only
papers for a cooler tone AFIAK) but something else. Can you shed some
light on the composition of Ilford warmtone paper?

Thanks!

Tim,

When I opened Brian's message with Outlook Express a message box popped up
telling me that the Active-X control wasn't valid -- or words to that
effect. I had McAfee virus check running but not Norton. I have both running
at my office.

You probably have automatic e-mail scanning turned on through Norton and the
worm was expunged by Norton Anti Virus. Have you checked your log?

At any rate this was about the third time that I received an infected Active
X control via e-mail. I have patched my version of OE to prevent VBS
invasions and have full e-mail scan turned on now.

I hope this helps.

I'm not a great fan of RC paper but I have used it from time to time. I =
think that where spots and faults appear on RC prints after a few =
months/years, the problem can be traced to bad processing. I have a =
print made on Ilfospeed 18 years ago by a friend which has been hanging =
on the wall behind glass since it was made. There are no signs of any =
deterioration or fading etc.,  I made my first prints 25 years ago on =
Ilfospeed and they are still perfectly OK although it is fair to say =
that they have been stored in print boxes and have not been displayed or =
exposed to light and atmospheric pollution.

The comments about Ctein's views and tests are interesting. I have the =
book and have read the article Christina referred too and gave to say =
that I am not convinced by his findings. I know that he has a big =
following in the states but have been told by a friend who  I trust and =
respect that some of Ctein' testing methods are considered to be suspect =
by many photographic researchers in this country (England). My friend =
works in the research department at Ilford and is the man responsible =
for the development of Ilford Warmtone paper so I feel that his =
credentials are good. I am certain that he is not spouting the party =
line on the RC longevity debate for I have had many long, interesting =
and open  debates with him on the subject.=20

I was interested in the comments about the considered similarities of RC =
and fibre papers earlier in this thread. I have always considered fibre =
to be a far superior paper in that I feel that it shows more depth and =
richness when compared to the same image printed on RC paper. It's as if =
the image seems to sink into the fibre of the paper which gives the =
depth, as against sitting on the surface of RC paper. That is my way of =
describing the difference. Logic says that both papers should produce =
the same result as the emulsion is likely to be the same but I feel that =
the "plastic" of RC prevents the "sinking in feeling". I consider myself =
to be a good printer and I'm confident that I can identify the =
difference between a fibre and RC print hanging on the wall.

It is fiber base but has a plastic or resin coating (polyethylene) on =
both
sides of the fiber base.  >

In the school I just graduated from we were not allowed to ever turn in =
RC
prints if we were photo majors; the only ones who could were in the
beginning photo class if they had to take photo for another major, e.g. =
art.
I, also, only prefer RC for ease of use, and feel that the look of RC =
sucks.
But I have to say I don't print glossy, so maybe that is where RC =
excels.

     A really good article on this whole issue was written by Ctein in =
the
Mar/April issue of Photo Techniques magazine; some of the above may be
quoted from that perhaps, but anyway, it is worth getting a reprint of =
it.
After reading that I wouldn't even think of printing archivally on resin
coated papers.  I also have, on my wall, 4 wonderful prints done by a
reputable lab here in town about 6 or so years ago (before I got into
photography) that have all turned brown, spotty and ugly.  It's a great
reminder for me to never print anything other than contact sheets on RC
because I may run the risk of reprinting, and since I handcolor my black =
and
whites (and large ones at that) I'd be out mucho time..

Right Brian, I have it on 'auto protect'.
I checked a scan of my disc and all was clear.
I take it it doesn't tell me if it finds something - given that I opened
Brians mail without any problem or notification?

Hello Tim,
Norton didn't find it in my system either, and it was there for some =
time.  Finally, when I realized I was "infected," I took someone's =
advice and went to the McAfee site.  They have a short term free trial; =
you download their anti-virus software from their site and scan away.  =
It found *two* kak files that neither Norton nor my Find function =
located; erased them, too.  Then, at a time you specify, McAfee will =
check your files and update your program.  I'm still using it free; =
don't know what the cost is when the trial runs out.
Regards,
John

      Thanks Andrew. I know I sent a reply to a message that contained =
the virus several days ago. Since that time I've brought my Norton anti =
virus program as current as it can get and have sent messages that I =
don't believe were infected with the virus so I thought everything was =
fine. Would you please let me know if this message gives any indication =

What exactly does this mean?  I used the warmtone paper once...I found the

   I can't speak specifically about Ilford Warmtone but in general the 
image color of B&W paper is mostly a matter of the structure of the silver 
particals which make up the image. The finer grained they are the yellower 
the image color. Extremely finely devided silver, known as colloidal 
silver, is, in fact, used as the yellow filter layer in many color films. 
It is removed in the same bleach step which removes the image silver.
   Warm toned papers are generally designed to have finer grained silver 
particals than cold or neutral papers.
   Many years ago most warm toned paper was primarily silver chloride, 
colder toned paper was primarily silver bromide. The bromide is faster and 
coarser then the chloride. While a few purely chloride or bromide papers 
have been made until recently most printing paper is a mixture of the two. 
The grain structure and image tone is also affected by the exact technique 
of making the emulsion, i.e. ripening and washing, and probably by additives.
   I have no doubt that Ilford Warmtone is a pretty much conventional paper 
made to produce a brownish image color.

    The most important is to have a good negative to get good print. If  
shadows and hightlights have a lot of details on the negative you must get a
very decent print by any technique used for printing : bulbs or coldhead or
colorhead would give good results if the printer is a good one and knows the
skill using fogging of flashing with graded papers or split grading or
multiple grading with VC papers .If there is no details on the negative it
is not possible to get them on the print.

Barry,

I know of  web sites that have examples of photographs done with PMK.
I know that you will have examples of DiXactol photos in your book when published.
But, are there now any examples of photos printed from DiXactol negative on the internet?

			yours just looking,

				Garry
P.S. thanks for your answers to my questions within your last posting.

Does anyone have any experience processing Tmax 3200 (@3200) in C-76 (D-76
with Crone-C additive)?
The literature included with the Crone-C is outdated and does not include a
suggested starting point, any help with this combination would be greatly
appreciated.

the internet?"

Sorry, not at the moment. I had a meeting yesterday with my web site
designer, and the site is being redesigned to accommodate some pictures
within the next couple of months (as well as some new technical
information). I am not sure how well web pictures show the qualities of a
particular developer. The necessary file compression makes them look pretty
grim in my opinion - or maybe I am just looking at the wrong sites?
I do have in mind a "Book of DiXactol". This would not be a technical 'how
to' book like Gordon Hutchings' "Book of Pyro". It would be a book of
pictures by users of DiXactol world wide. I would send out an invitation to
all users to submit images. I have not thought through the precise format,
but my basic thoughts were one picture per contributor with the image on one
page with the facing page being given to text from the contributor on the
aesthetic/technical hows and why-fors of the picture. An index of the
contributors with contact details for those with commercial interests would
be published in the book and on my web site.
This hasn't been a top priority item for me - just an idea bouncing around
in my mind (there's a lot of empty space in there!). Your thoughts on such a
project would be welcome.

    "The most important is to have a good negative to get good print. If
shadows and hightlights have a lot of details on the negative you must get a
very decent print by any technique used for printing : bulbs or coldhead or
colorhead would give good results if the printer is a good one and knows the
skill using fogging of flashing with graded papers or split grading or
multiple grading with VC papers .If there is no details on the negative it
is not possible to get them on the print."

This is true only up to a point. A good print can be obtained with the
techniques you mention, along with many others such a latent image
pre-bleaching, post bleaching etc. Usually, though, all this manipulation is
purely to compensate for a less than perfect negative. That's how
professional printers like me earn a living - providing good pictures from
very ordinary negatives. But a FINE print can only be made from a fine
negative. Going back to the discussion of enlarger light sources, the fact
is that a print made on a condenser enlarger from a negative with its
density range adjusted to that light source will be indistinguishable from a
print made on a cold light/diffuser enlarger from a negative with the
correct density range for that light source - except that the condenser-made
print usually looks that little bit sharper, though there are other
variables in the sharpness equation.
The reason cold light/diffuser light sources gained their mystique as being
'superior' is that the vast majority of monochrome negatives are
underexposed and overdeveloped, so they are too contrasty - obviously this
excludes those photographers working carefully with the zone system, or
effective derivatives of it. However, most photographers don't. They use
automatic camera exposure with the film maker's standard film speed and the
developer maker's standard time regardless of taking conditions. So printers
like me continually find ourselves battling with burned out skies and empty
shadows, for instance, in clients' negatives. Obviously cold light/diffusion
makes life a lot easier then.
Too often photographers are given esteem by being wizards of print
manipulation rather than by getting fine image making right from the point
of composition AND exposure/processing in the first place. Most
photographers coming to me for coaching at my workshop are staggered at the
ease with which fine prints can be made when negative exposure and
processing is adjusted to the taking conditions and their enlarger's
contrast characteristics.
>From my Ilford lectures, I know that the average photographer is mightily
impressed by all these darkroom dodges, and bored stiff by the thoughts of
getting the negative right in the first place. Personally, I don't want to
go into the darkroom to do battle with negative, but to work WITH a
responsive one to realise all its subtleties.

May I kindly suggest that you revert to "plain text" without

I guess the winmail.dat file, about which I didn't know incidentally,
occurred because I used Microsoft Word as my email editor. I have already
moved to plain text, and attachments are taboo from here on. Sorry again.

I've used c-76 for a number of years and have had
good results with PX and Tri-X.  Tried it once with
TMZ (p3200).  Talk about thin, I mean really thin
negatives.  Unprintable.  

I like acutance so I'm using rodinal 1 + 50 for 
development of TMZ.  I like the look.

If any one can remember I asked the list back in February about U.S suppliers 
of Verichrome Pan film who would ship to the U.K.
I subsequently purchased some from B&H in New York, which I received in 
April, and said I would post some results on pure-silver.
I have put some comments and images from the first two films I have used on 
to a web page. When I originally enquired about where to obtain Verichrome 
Pan, one or two people asked why I was so keen to use it. I have also tried 
to provide an answer to that question.
This is my first attempt at a web page and it was difficult trying not to let 
a preoccupation with producing it affect the content. I hoped that the images 
would save me some words even though they have lost quite a bit in the 
process.

Michael
I had a look at your site - it looks good to me. I too have been working
away with Verichrome and would confirm your general view of the film. You
might like to know that I have a piece about Verichrome and FortÅÈpan in the
next issue of Ag+ magazine.
I have been using PMK a lot with Verichrome with exceptional staining -
better than HP5 Plus which was the previous staining champ. The Film
Developing Cookbook shows a speed of only EI64 in PMK at 7 minutes
development. I find an easy EI100 even when I had to pull development to 6
minutes for high subject brightness range.
I am interested that you tried Unitol. My next developer is due to be
Ilfosol S, a much underrated brew which also has a low solvent action. With
FP4 Plus, it is claimed by Ilford to give highest sharpness of their own
developers AND finest grain - quite an achievement. Let's see how it goes on
with Verichrome...

I'm fairly new to this list so apologize for any repeated threads.

I wanted to mention that this film has no antihalation layer.
"light-piping" will not be as suppressed. It can be had in rolls of 5 inch
and 10 inches to be hand cut if needed for LF.
I have never used it with the Pyro developers or Barry's DiXactol but
Rodinal is excellent.
Am I correct that the tanning developers would help arrest the problems with
internal flair by keeping acuity at its sharpest point?
 Is this film a thicker emulsion or in the same class as Plus x or Tri x.
Would it work like more modern films in a water bath development { d23} or
is it more likely to develop more like the modern films?
 Thanks and sorry if this is repeat stuff,
Chuck Downs
  Has anyone hand cut roll film for loading in holders?

Can't say if its distributed your side of the water but IMHO as a subscriber
for several years, it really is a top class publication. The kind you keep
and actually use for reference. Good luck.

   Previous thread snipped..

V-Pan does have an anti-halation layer. The dye in the support you mention 
is found only in 35mm negative film, its never used in roll or sheet film, 
or in transparency film of any size.
  Its intended to prevent fogging from the conduction of light, or 
light-piping, through the support when one end of the support is exposed to 
the light, as is often the case with 35mm film. This dye or pigment is 
_not_ removed in processing. The result is that B+F for 35mm negative films 
is higher than for the same film coated for other formats. The effect is 
simply to raise the printing time. 35m color films usually have a clear 
support and an under-the -emulsion anti-halation layer as mentioned below.
   The so-called anti-halation layer is actually dye in the anti-curling 
gelatin which is coated on the back of the support. This dye is decolorized 
by the developer. The layer is not removed since the gelatin is needed for 
its anti-curling function.
  Transparency films have an anti-halation layer under the emulsion. This 
prevents fogging from light-piping. It is also de-colorized by the 
developer or bleach.
    Some motion picture films, and Kodachrome, have what Kodak calls a 
RemJet backing. This is a rather thick combination anti-halation and 
anti-static layer, which _is_ completely removed in processing by blowing 
it off with jets of hot water (Rem-ove with Jet of water, get it?) This 
backing raises hob if motion picture negative film is processed in a normal 
C-41 machine, leaving a tar-like substance all over the machine.
   In any case, Verichrome Pan has no particular problem with halation or 
irradiation. Despite the double coat it is very sharp and has rather high 
resolution. I am not sure if the film is actually coated with two coatings 
or if the emulsions are mixed. Double coating used to be a standard method 
of making all film, the two emulsions being of different speed and 
contrast. Modern emulsion making technique can control the curve of the 
film with a single emulsion, which tends to be sharper. Verichrome Pan is 
_not_ an old fashioned film in the sense that some of the stuff 
manufactured in the former eastern European countries is. They are 
throwbacks to pre-1960 technology.
   V-Pan does not have a retouching surface, which is included in Kodak's 
"professional" roll films.
  The colors found in some used developers, Rodinal comes to mind, is not 
anti-halation dye but rather reaction products of development. You will not 
find these colors in some developers. D-76, for instance, will be slightly 
straw colored after use, from the oxidation products of development.

Barry,
Why do you use PMK rather than Dixactol with the verichrome, and do you have any
comparitive results? Are those  verichrome development times quoted at 70
degrees F? I assume your times are for condensor enlargers?
Thanks

Somebody asked what light wasused for development by inpsection.

Kodak makes several safelights of different sizes, but always recommends a
Green #3 for development by inspection.

I don't know if a piece of green celophane wrapped over a flashlight would
work, but I'd never tried, either.

   The #3 is just barely visible in a dark room with dark adapted eyes. Its 
intended to be used for inspecting negatives by _transmitted_ light. After 
the development is about half completed the film will be substantially 
desensitized by the developer and the anti-halation dye will have become 
decolorized. The film will be translucent. With a lot of practice you can 
tell something about the image by inspection. The safelight can be used for 
only a few seconds at a time. The further development has progressed the 
less the chance of fogging.
   Panchromatic film can be desensitized with Pinacryptol green to the 
point where it can be developed under a normal dark red safellight. 
Pinacryptol is hard to find and expensive. I think Photographer's Formulary 
may have it.
   In the bad old days many photographers used orthochromatic film, which 
is not sensitive to red light. That can be developed by inspection under a 
dark red safelight, which is bright enough to actually see what the image 
is doing.
   One reason for the popularity of development by inspection many years 
ago was the uncertainty of exposures and the lack of reproducability of 
some of the developers used, particularly some of the Pyro formulas.  Time 
and temperature is a much better way to work although instpection is sill 
valuable when working with film which has been grossly mis-exposed.
   I suspect a flashlight with green celophane would be much too 
bright.  The Green color is chosen because it is simultaneously the color 
the eye is most sensitive to when dark adapted and the color where most 
panchromatic films have a dip in the sensitivity curve.

Don't use this filter with any of the Tmax films, they will fog. And if
memory serves me correctly, so will Ilford Delta films.  The filter is used
with a 15 watt light bulb kept at least 40 inches from the film. You should
not keep the light on all during development. It should only be popped on
for short times to see how the development is going.  The old timers would
say that when the highlights match a shadow cast by your finger, it's time
to pull the film. Tried it, didn't care for it.

Developing by inspection using the green light won't do too well with green
cellophane, it will fog film quickly. Get the old, cheap bullet safelights
from a yard sale or swap meet for a quarter or so & use a 15 watt light in
it.

Once you have been doing it a bit you can watch the detail in the negative
come up until it is just right. This is especially valuable when processing
some negs that need a bit of attention. You can pop the light on for a
second or three while looking and see just how the densities are progressing
and/or separating in delicate areas. You can watch & see the negative as
this happens & decide, after a few sheets for experience, that one needs to
be pulled a bit sooner or longer than you might have thought. It is useful
for more than exposure mistakes.

If you want to try it, here is a simple way to learn quickly. Expose 6
sheets of film exactly the same. Go into the darkroom with all chemistry
mixed in trays & ready to go. Put all 6 sheets in the developer & watch the
clock until half the expected time has passed. Then, turn on the green
safelight for a few seconds while viewing the neg from the base side. See if
you can make out any detail or separation in lights or darks, at all. Even
if you can't, put this neg in the stop. Then, a minute or two later do the
next, same procedure. By the time you do all 6, you will have a running
record of ongoing development by inspection, watching more detail &
separation come up each time you check out another negative. By putting each
in the stop as you view them, you will have a record from under to (most
likely) over development. A visual record to go with your green light
experience.

Fix, rinse & dry & make contacts.

One nice thing is that time has no real meaning with this type of
development other than as a reference. Even if the temp drops or development
action slows as you process, your visual clues still work well. You SEE the
negative densities as you work, though in 1-3 second visuals at various
intervals. The first set of 6 will give experience and help you to learn
just what happens in the dark. A great reference for future use.

If you want to go further, expose a full set of 18 negatives, one set of 6 2
stops underexposed, one set normal and one set 2 stops overexposed. Then, go
into the dark & in 3 separate batches process the sets separately just as
the first set learned on. You will end up with three great sets of
instructional negatives. They will all show underdevelopement to
overdevelopment, using negs that are under, normally and over exposed. A
perfect and fast way to see the effects of both exposure & development, both
in the dark under green safelight & in the light afterwards. This will
accelerate the learning and help you to be able to judge density in the dark
quickly & easily.

Some say this is a real pain, developing by inspection. But try coming back
from a shooting expedition with 30-200 negs. Imagine sitting at the JOBO for
days while waiting for 1-6 sheets at a time to develop. It is easier to do
them in the dark, a batch at a time while concurrrently catching any errors
in exposure metering at the same time.

PS: thanks for guidance & info on inspection development go to Paula Chamlee
from the 1999 Mammoth Camera Workshop put on by Tillman Crane at the
Waterford Institute in Sandy, Utah-Paula gave an excellent hands on
inspection development demo that I found usable immediately.

Stephen
I do use DiXactol with Verichrome, but it suffers very high base fog. I have
'tweaked' the formula to get rid of this for my own personal use, but it is
not as good as PMK for Verichrome I am sorry to have to admit. There are
always particularly happy combinations of film and developer, and
Verichrome/PMK seems to be one of them. I particularly like the tonality the
combination produces when printing on FortÅÈ Museum graded paper.
My quoted times are for use in a diffuser enlarger, but on graded paper
which prints harder and 'brighter' than VC with stained negatives. One of
the peculiarities of printing with a staining developer is that moving
between condenser and diffuser enlargers makes less difference than with
conventional developers because some of the printing density is provided by
the stain, which is not affected by the Callier effect. This, obviously, is
even more marked with films like Ilford XP2 which have a purely 'stain'
image.
Incidentally, I forgot to mention that I have got the expected excellent
results from two bath metol developer without fuss with both Verichrome and
FortÅÈpan 100 (formula on my web site www.barrythornton.com) at EI80 at 4+4
minutes at 21Å∞C. Also with Verichrome, I have been experimenting with my own
slightly modified version of FX1 metol high definition developer using
partial 'stand' development. Rating the film at EI160 I agitate the film
continuously for the first minute, then at 3 minute intervals for a total of
16 minutes. Sharpness is excellent. Unlike PMK which gives peculiarly
flattened highlights when printing on VC paper, it will print on any type of
paper, but there is some tonal compression in the middle tones (not
measured - just a subjective impression).
Grain in all the developers I have used has not been a problem. One
interesting point from the Kodak technical data sheets is that Verichrome
has a finer grain than Plus-X (using a D76 development regime). Kodak show
an rms granularity figure of 9 for Verichrome. Plus-X is 10. As a comparison
TMX is 8, and TMY is 10.

For the record Steve, Kodak write in their technical data sheet about

make "Do not use a safelight ...Using a safelight will affect your results"
(Kodak's italics).

I have a lot of information about this from two recently acquired American
photographic magazines from the turn of the 19th Century. It was interesting
to learn that 'factorial development', well known for prints, was first
evolved for negative development by inspection.
These instructional magazines are fascinating, but I can't really see a
practical way of distributing the information to the pure-silver group.
There is just too much text to re-key, and part of their charm is the
beautiful typography of the editorial and advertisement pages (and the fact
that, though American, they use proper English spelling, not American!
Sorry - just had to get that little dig in.). If anyone is interested I
could scan a few pages and put them up to the group as much condensed .jpg
files - but that may be very irritating to those not interested who had to
put up with extended download times.

Subject:	Re: Green Light for By Inspection

Developing by inspection using the green light won't do too well with green
cellophane, it will fog film quickly. Get the old, cheap bullet safelights
from a yard sale or swap meet for a quarter or so & use a 15 watt light in
it.

Once you have been doing it a bit you can watch the detail in the negative
come up until it is just right. This is especially valuable when processing
some negs that need a bit of attention. You can pop the light on for a
second or three while looking and see just how the densities are progressing
and/or separating in delicate areas. You can watch & see the negative as
this happens & decide, after a few sheets for experience, that one needs to
be pulled a bit sooner or longer than you might have thought. It is useful
for more than exposure mistakes.

If you want to try it, here is a simple way to learn quickly. Expose 6
sheets of film exactly the same. Go into the darkroom with all chemistry
mixed in trays & ready to go. Put all 6 sheets in the developer & watch the
clock until half the expected time has passed. Then, turn on the green
safelight for a few seconds while viewing the neg from the base side. See if
you can make out any detail or separation in lights or darks, at all. Even
if you can't, put this neg in the stop. Then, a minute or two later do the
next, same procedure. By the time you do all 6, you will have a running
record of ongoing development by inspection, watching more detail &
separation come up each time you check out another negative. By putting each
in the stop as you view them, you will have a record from under to (most
likely) over development. A visual record to go with your green light
experience.

Fix, rinse & dry & make contacts.

One nice thing is that time has no real meaning with this type of
development other than as a reference. Even if the temp drops or development
action slows as you process, your visual clues still work well. You SEE the
negative densities as you work, though in 1-3 second visuals at various
intervals. The first set of 6 will give experience and help you to learn
just what happens in the dark. A great reference for future use.

If you want to go further, expose a full set of 18 negatives, one set of 6 2
stops underexposed, one set normal and one set 2 stops overexposed. Then, go
into the dark & in 3 separate batches process the sets separately just as
the first set learned on. You will end up with three great sets of
instructional negatives. They will all show underdevelopement to
overdevelopment, using negs that are under, normally and over exposed. A
perfect and fast way to see the effects of both exposure & development, both
in the dark under green safelight & in the light afterwards. This will
accelerate the learning and help you to be able to judge density in the dark
quickly & easily.

Some say this is a real pain, developing by inspection. But try coming back
from a shooting expedition with 30-200 negs. Imagine sitting at the JOBO for
days while waiting for 1-6 sheets at a time to develop. It is easier to do
them in the dark, a batch at a time while concurrrently catching any errors
in exposure metering at the same time.

PS: thanks for guidance & info on inspection development go to Paula Chamlee
from the 1999 Mammoth Camera Workshop put on by Tillman Crane at the
Waterford Institute in Sandy, Utah-Paula gave an excellent hands on
inspection development demo that I found usable immediately.

AG+ is a very good, but stereo-typically British-quirky magazine.

I have several issues I bought used.... Best buy a copy or 2 of the old
issues before plunging into a longer commitment......It is NOT your average
Popular Photo Mag!

I might recommend Camera and Darkroom Magazine as well... another British
specialty magazine by Ed Buziak...... a bit more useable, and I think more
on target for a user.  Not as nose-in-the-air scholarly....$50 per year,
$100 for 1 year plus
10 back issues...... ( or so I remember...)

Andy,

I'm not sure I'll ever do it (I did do some ortho by inspection 40 years 
ago), but I'd sure like to be put on the "attachment list" if you do send out 
any of them.  As a retired chemical engineer, I like to be prepared for the 
'chemical option' in the event the need arises.

Sincerely,

I use a green #3 for like 15 seconds; and it works for me with all =
films.

I have dropped film, and had to turn on the room light, or found film on =
the floor after most of my film was already in the fix for a minute; and =
no additional fog resulted, ever.  Film developes and stays firm pretty =
resiliantly, I have found.

  Richard,
                Pinacryptol green is expensive and not readily available =
down under, however pinacryptol yellow is along with phenosafarine is. =
Although you have to neutralize the red colour bias with the =
phenosafrine both work so well that you can indeed use a conventional =
red printing safe light. I have used a dilution of 1:2000 with a 1 =

time in total darkness before turning on the red light. I wrote an =

negatives.=20

<< AG+ is a very good, but stereo-typically British-quirky magazine.
 
 I have several issues I bought used.... Best buy a copy or 2 of the old
 issues before plunging into a longer commitment......It is NOT your average
 Popular Photo Mag!
 
 I might recommend Camera and Darkroom Magazine as well... another British
 specialty magazine by Ed Buziak...... a bit more useable, and I think more
 on target for a user.  Not as nose-in-the-air scholarly....$50 per year,
 $100 for 1 year plus
 10 back issues...... ( or so I remember...)
 
 email Ed at:  100410.1561@compuserve.com >>

To all:

Ed Buziak has closed his account with CompuServe (like me). His new

Steve,

You have an unsafe Active X control embedded in your last message sent to
the Pure Silver list. You got this from Andy Cross. It is probably the Kak
Worm Virus.

Here is a handy text file that was posted by someone
in a video game newsgroup by someone who was also
annoyed by the Kak virus. By the way, if you load the
patch that will actually tell you that the Active X
control is unsafe then you are being protected from
the virus and will not be reinfected.

Here it is:



Kill the Kak virus.
 
First do a search for "kak" on your hard drive. If you
don't find anything,
ignore this post. If you do, you'll be passing it on
to others. After
ages trying to get OE on-line and working, I worked
out how to kill the virus.
 
THIS VIRUS ISN'T HARMLESS!!!
 
First of all you'll be wondering what the virus is. I
know I did. I am no
computer expert but I don't think that I'm wrong about
this. The whole
thing came from Lichee's e-mail. It does the
following:
 
When you read a .kak infected post, it reads the
signature. Now
signatures are usually something like:
[AMC]NinjaGaz
The Virus Killa
 
But this virus copies the file kak.htm to your hard
drive. This file is
replaced every time you try to delete it. This is
because kak.htm
implants itself into your registry. Not only that, but
it implants itself into
YOUR signature, so that anyone who reads it will take
the signature. Some
people have been immune but I don't know why, maybe
their virus checking
software found it.
 
The kak.htm file copies kak.hta to your start-up which
runs kak.reg -
which changes your signature. Kak.hta and kak.reg are
then both deleted. OK.
you may think, so its implanting itself in everyones
computer. Whats the harm
in that?  Well after following the trail from kak.htm,
to kak.hta and then
finally to the killer kak.reg I found out exactly why
all this was going
on.

Now I can't tell you exactly what this means, but from
what I can tell,
from about 17 days or hours after the virus was
implanted into your system.
The registry will read load up all the necessary
drivers then will run the
command exit windows and display the words
"Kagou-Anti-Kro$oft says not
today !" followed by the shutting of windows.

Basically 17 days after the virus is implanted your
computer wont load up
thanks to the tossers know as Kagou-Anti-Kro$oft. This
is NOT a joke. I
SERIOUSLY recommend you do the following to kill the
virus:

Step 1

First of all delete the following files:
Kak.htm
Kak.reg
Kak.hta
Plus another file which I will tell you later.
 
ALL VERSIONS!!!
 
Step 2
 
Do a FIND for regedit.exe
Double click it then goto:

[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\\\Identities\\\\'+idn+'\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\
Outlook Express\\\\5.0]

It should say "File C:\windows\kak.htm"
Right click on the word "file" and delete it. Then do
the same to all the
other files EXCEPT default.
 
Ok now, still on regedit do the following:

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\
CurrentVersion\\\\Run]
The "kak" demons have added a file, which will run
everytime you boot
windows. Look down the list for a file ending hta.
Under the "name"
heading it will say cAg0u (i.e. meaning Kagou). You
MUST DELETE the file also.
so.

Do a FIND for *.hta

Delete the file you find. It should be in the system
directory

Step 3

You now need to FIND your autoexec.bat and delete the
bottom two lines -
they will go on about the kak files. It starts with
"@echo off"

That is it. I hope!

For reference the files will be found in the following
directories:

Kak.htm  =  C:\
Kak.htm  =  C:\Windows
Kak.reg  =  C:\Windows
Kak.hta  =  C:\Windows\SatMenu\Programs\StartUP

You will also find the kak.htm in the
c:\windows\profiles\yourname\recent -
if you use that stuff
Something.hta =  C:\Windows\system

Can I just add, that if I HADN'T given the major
warning and I HADN'T
tried to sort this out, then many people would have a
major problem. I would
advise people to spread the word and get this virus
killed. This is aimed
at all the people who criticised me for bringing up
this topic.

To all the others I hope you get the problem sorted
and we should keep
bringing this up, because if one person is still
infected then we will
all be reinfected.

Copy the whole post to word and save it there. That
way if you get the
virus again you'll know what to do.

Thank you for your time.

[AMC]NinjaGaz

Thanks for your comments.  I have been using some Unitol recently for it's 
very good midtone gradation. In general the gradation seems to fall between 
an acutance developer and a solvent developer such as ID11, but has finer 
grain than say Rodinal.
The negatives of the Tulips I had originally intended to develop in Dixactol, 
but the small amount I had left had unfortunately died. My next choice would 
have been PMK, but I had exposed the film at EI 100 and the only guide I had 
to development at the time was from the film development cookbook, which was 
recommending an EI of 64. Thus I opted for a trial in Unitol.
Previous tests with HP5 in Unitol had given me an EI of 320 with 12 minutes 
at 20'C for 1+17 dilution. Based on this I developed the Verichrome Pan for 
10 minutes at 20'C with 1+17 dilution. In retrospect I think that 15 to 20% 
less would have been better for me.

Michael
I had a look at your site - it looks good to me. I too have been working
away with Verichrome and would confirm your general view of the film. You
might like to know that I have a piece about Verichrome and Fort=E9pan in th=
e
next issue of Ag+ magazine.
I have been using PMK a lot with Verichrome with exceptional staining -
better than HP5 Plus which was the previous staining champ. The Film
Developing Cookbook shows a speed of only EI64 in PMK at 7 minutes
development. I find an easy EI100 even when I had to pull development to 6
minutes for high subject brightness range.
I am interested that you tried Unitol. My next developer is due to be
Ilfosol S, a much underrated brew which also has a low solvent action. With
FP4 Plus, it is claimed by Ilford to give highest sharpness of their own
developers AND finest grain - quite an achievement. Let's see how it goes on
with Verichrome...

If any one can remember I asked the list back in February about U.S
suppliers
of Verichrome Pan film who would ship to the U.K.
I subsequently purchased some from B&H in New York, which I received in
April, and said I would post some results on pure-silver.
I have put some comments and images from the first two films I have used on
to a web page. When I originally enquired about where to obtain Verichrome
Pan, one or two people asked why I was so keen to use it. I have also tried
to provide an answer to that question.
This is my first attempt at a web page and it was difficult trying not to
let
a preoccupation with producing it affect the content. I hoped that the
images
would save me some words even though they have lost quite a bit in the

The following text  was found at http://www.inoli.com/viruses/kak.htm. For
those of you that have been curious, here is some detailed information about
the virus and what you may wish to do. I know this is way off topic but I've
struggled with this problem for 2 weeks with 3 different computers and it
seems to be propagated quite heavily from this list. This isn't a common
virus like Melissa and will only affect users of Outlook Express.

Hope this helps,

Don Bryant

Virus Name: WScript/Kak.worm

 Virus Characteristics:
*Update: March 2, 2000 - Virus Patrol continues to identify more
occurrences of this Internet worm in newsgroup postings, which is an
indication that this is spreading further. This worm was first discovered
by AVERT in December and added detection for it within 4051 DAT updates.
AVERT recommends adding ".HTA" to file extensions scanned for
protection, and also ensure users have <b>installed the security patch
from Microsoft mentioned below.

Another dangerous aspect of this Internet worm is the ability to
continuously re-infect yourself if the preview pane is enabled and
you browse between folders specifically the "sent" folder which happens to
contain the Internet worm within a message. This is another strong reason
to update to the security patch, if not already.*

This is an Internet worm which uses ActiveX and Windows Scripting Host to
propagate itself through email using MS Outlook Express 5. This worm
consists of 3 components, an HTA file (HTML for Applications), a REG file
(Registration Entries Update) and a BAT file (MS-DOS Batch).

The method used to integrate these components is to have first composed an
email message in HTML which supports scripting. Using an ActiveX exploit
known as "Scriptlet TypeLib", the script writes an HTA file to the local
machine, typically in the startup folder. This will launch the code
embedded in the HTA file at the next Windows startup. Microsoft has
published a security update which addresses this ActiveX exploit and users
are encouraged to update their systems with this component. With this
update installed, users are questioned if they wish to run the ActiveX
control which is marked "safe for scripting".

For more details on this vulnerability and to obtain a patch from
Microsoft, see this link
http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/ms99-032.asp

For current security bulletins from Microsoft, see this link:
http://www.microsoft.com/security/bulletins/current.asp

mail messages written in HTML format will be coded with the Internet worm
on infected systems due to the default signature modification on infected
systems. The email application Outlook Express is a target of this
Internet worm for propagation due to its support for HTML format messages.
If an email message is coded with the WScript/Kak.worm code and it is
allowed to run, files are written to the local machine in different
locations-

c:\windows\kak.htm
c:\windows\system\(name).hta
c:\windows\Menu DÅÈmarrer\Programmes\DÅÈmarrage\kak.hta
c:\windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp\kak.hta

In the above list, "(name)" is a random 8 character name (e.g.
98278AE0.HTA). The path name of "DÅÈmarrage" gives us an indication that
its origin is France with target installations of French Windows 9x
operating systems; the secondary path targets English installations.

The AUTOEXEC.BAT file is modified to run the file KAK.HTA and then delete
it from its folder location. The system registry is also modified when the
script executes a shell registry update using regedit and the REG file
written to the local system. The registry modification is this-

KLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<br>
cAg0u = "C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\(name).hta"

The entry "(name)" is a random 8 character name (e.g. 98278AE0.HTA).

The email spreading method is possible by a registry modification which
adds a signature to MS Outlook Express 5. The signature is set to include
the file "C:\WINDOWS\kak.htm" and is set as the default signature such
that the worm is spread on all outgoing email if the signature is
included.

The contents of the HTM file are just a small file which consists of script
to run the KAK.HTA file which already exists on the target machine. The
code looks specifically for browser versions IE5 or NetScape Navigator
higher than v4.0. Finally this worm also has a payload which is date
activated.

On the 1st of the month, and beginning from 6PM local time, a message is
displayed:

"Kagou-Anti-Kro$oft says not today!"

Since our discussions about finding bulbs for the multi contrast heads,
there has come up an interest to acquire an Aristo or one of the Ilford 500
series enlarger heads by a friend who is not a computer list subscriber
after my convesations about our posts on the subject.

If anyone has one available or would like to take this opportunity to unload
one, please let me know off the list.

Richard,
     Oh well there goes another urban legend!
I had been to a couple of Kodak Seminars that passed the info about no
antihalation layer on Verichrome.  One even stated that the reason that
there was no 220 version was that there was special paper backing used on
the 120 that couldn't be used on the 220 version.
  Sad that there isn't something extra special about Verichrome but am glad
to have the info corrected.  In the 60's the Verichrome  developed in
Rodinal was my 2 1/4 film choice --Just picked up a couple of rolls and will
enjoy trying a staining developer on it.

  Said by Kodak people? Astonishing.
  FWIW,I just looked at a roll of V-Pan I use to check camera transports. I 
could scrape off the anti-halation layer on the back. As far as I can tell 
the backing paper is no different than that used for other roll films. What 
Plus-X and other "professional" films do have is a retouching surface on 
one or both sides. V-Pan has neither, not a big deal.
   I think the real reason V-Pan is not available in 220 is that Kodak 
offers the medium toe version of Plus-X in that size. Medium-toe Plus-X and 
V-Pan don't seem to be the same emulsion but are similar in performance. I 
wish Kodak offered one or the other in sheet sizes.

Jessops' Econotol used to be Unitol, but the trouble is with own-brand stuff
like this is that they quietly change suppliers and formulae without notice.
So I don't know whether Econotol is still the genuine Unitol article or not.
Thanks for your processing time info - I'll giver it a whirl in due course.
Another developer that logically should work well with Verichrome is the
original Acutol. It was never a very aggressive sharpness developer, and I
think it would fall between the solvent-type developers and FX1 as you
observe about Unitol. Another brew to add to the suck-it-and-see list for
later!

Thanks for your comments.  I have been using some Unitol recently for it's
very good midtone gradation. In general the gradation seems to fall between
an acutance developer and a solvent developer such as ID11, but has finer
grain than say Rodinal.
The negatives of the Tulips I had originally intended to develop in
Dixactol,
but the small amount I had left had unfortunately died. My next choice would
have been PMK, but I had exposed the film at EI 100 and the only guide I had
to development at the time was from the film development cookbook, which was
recommending an EI of 64. Thus I opted for a trial in Unitol.
Previous tests with HP5 in Unitol had given me an EI of 320 with 12 minutes
at 20'C for 1+17 dilution. Based on this I developed the Verichrome Pan for
10 minutes at 20'C with 1+17 dilution. In retrospect I think that 15 to 20%
less would have been better for me.

I've been looking for my notes from the classes that I was attending { three
day seminars } I did find a 3x5 card with the disproved 120 verses 220
statements. I in no way want to disparage Kodak or other folks, like Nikon,
that do the traveling seminars but over the years I guess that I have heard
many "urban legends" started or passed as true. On balance the seminars if
carefully thought about and double-checked are great for photographers. I
learned about using E3 and C22 { 1966?} at home and even attended a one
night demo on SPRAY-ON chemicals for B&W and color papers. { it did work!
....well somewhat }. The trade shows are the worst for gaining good info but
are great fun as it's always fun to play with the latest F1.4 - 400mm - lens
in a easy to use Copal # 0.
 I've been to several digital programs and can now say that "no one that is
serious about photography would still shoot silver-based
cameras!"..........It has got to be true because I heard it directly from
the tech. reps. :o)

Photo retreat, my <Biblical Beast Of Burden>!  You guys are just gonna
have a great time taking pictures, hanging out with some of the nicest
people I know, eating well, drinking well, and generally having more fun
than adults ought be be allowed.  "Retreat" indeed, Hmmf!

For those of you around the world who may not know, Gerry Spence is one
of the foremost trial attorneys in the US (the good kind: he doesn't
trust the Government either)  and an avid photographer as well.

Hello !
I'll be pleased to have such scans on my hard drive !
I think, as they _really_ are related to the pure silver subject be
worth the download time, more than the auto response messages or the KAK
worm virus messages we have got recently ! (Just kidding ;) )
Best regards !

Hello !
I'll be pleased to have such scans on my hard drive !
I think, as they _really_ are related to the pure silver subject be
worth the download time, more than the auto response messages or the KAK
worm virus messages we have got recently ! (Just kidding ;) )
Best regards !

Hello !
As your post could be virus infected, I do not reply to you using the

I'll be pleased to read your attachment, either by direct email, or

I hope you will get rid of the KAK virus !

Hello all !
I am planning to convert some part of my basement in a permanent
darkroom (saving me the pain from converting back my bathroom ;)
As such, I'll have an easy access to the well water pipes used to help
my lawn growing.
Unfortunately I live near a cemetery so the well water is full with
bacteria (of different kind) and is _really_ hard.
I am wondering if it is worth the effort to use it to wash prints
(drinkable water is metered and at a high price in my country)
What would be the pros and cons of using it ?
Do you think the bacteria will be harmful for the gelatin ?
Your help would help me convince my wife, (which do not like my hobby
...., and the costs involved in it.)
Thanks !

    Snipping done here...

   Along this line is the press release on the Kodak site for Xtol, written 
by some vice president of the company. It says:

"Kodak developer D-76 is a case in point. This developer is considered the 
standard for general-purpose black-and-white processing.
Our records list its first appearance in the Kodak catalog of 1934. 
However, some historians claim it was really created for developing
Kodak movie film during the 1920s."

   Well, of course, he is confusing the date of the release of a 
commercialy packaged product with the date of release of the formula. The 
actual date (1927)isn't hard to find and the lline about "some historians" 
is ludicrous.  This guy is probably not over 25 and doesn't know about 
anything that happened before he was 10.
   Of course, Kodak give all its corporate records to RIT and dismantled 
its famous research laboratory, so, I suppose, a non specialist can be 
excused for not being able to find some corporate history easily. Large 
corporations are much like amoeba, they live for the moment, spending their 
lives merging and splitting.

     Gelatin is a pretty good culture medium, I think the bacteria would 
cause all sorts of problems. Water can be conserved by using a sulfite wash 
aid like Kodak Hypo Clearing Agent.
   Hard water, per se, is not a problem, in fact, it tends to wash faster 
than soft water. The idea of wash aids came from the fact that sea water 
washes out hypo about five times as fast as fresh water although the sea 
water residue must be itself washed out with a fresh water rinse. Extensive 
research came up with the buffered sulfite solution as the closest thing to 
sea water.
   For fiber paper the Ilford Archival fixing and washing procedure can be 
a water saver. However, the required fixing time of one minute maximum can 
not be achieved with all papers. n particular Kodak paper takes too long to 
fix.
   Water can also be conserved by washing in successive changes of water 
rather than in running water. In particular, so-called archival print 
washers are mostly very wasteful of water.

Hello All,
Anybody out there in photoland using Bergger film processed in PMK? or 
in...?
Would appreciate any input/advice about this film, said to be very close to 
old Super XX type film.
Cheers.

Georges,
I've read about people who've used ocean salt water for rinsing, with a
final rinse in 'purified' or filtered water.
I think the article was in a Popular Photography, darkroom issue. It was
talking about a photographer, (I don't remember who), who develops his
prints in his VW van, using whatever water is available for initial rinses
(first 90% or so of the rinse time), and bottle water for a final rinse. So
I'd guess that you could use your well water for rinsing, and have some
filtered water (or a filter on your line into your darkroom - see
http://darkroomsource.com/plumbingboard.htm for how I did it) for the final
rinse.

Hope this helps,
Andy Hughes

I'm not familiar with it  but am looking for a "thick" emulsion film. Would
this film be considered a thicker emulsion or does it have similar tones to
the SuperXX only and a modern emulsion?
 Where might I find some?

Sounds interesting,
Chuck

   Original post snipped...

    The use of sea water for washing has been known since c.1890. It was 
widely practiced in the Navy during WW-2 for processing aboard ship or 
elswhere where fresh water was scarce. The film or print needs a final 
rinse in fresh water since the iodides, etc., remaining after a sea water 
wash will cause the image to break down faster than an unwashed emulsion.
   The widely used sulfite wash aids were devised from the research into 
whey sea water was so effective. It was at first thought that it was only 
the pH, however, alkaline baths are not nearly as effective as sea water or 
sulfite. The main effect of an alkali bath is to adjust the pH of the 
emulsion. This reduces or eliminates a mordanting effect of potassium 
aluminum sulfate hardeners, which takes place only over the fairly nearrow 
range where it is effective as a hardener. Other hadeners don't manifest 
the mordanting effect even though some of them, like chrome alum, require a 
much lower pH to work.
   Sea water and Sulfite seem to be ion exchangers, replacing the 
thiosulfate with some other salt which is easier to wash out.
   Kodak Hypo Clearing Agent is a Sulfite solution, about 2% at working 
strength, buffered to about neutral with sodium bisulfite and containing 
some EDTA and citric acid as sequestering agents to prevent the deposition 
of calcium, or other minerals, on the film.
   Sodium or Ammonium sulfite seem to be the closest to sea water in 
effectiveness.
   Again, with sea water, it is very important that the sea water residue 
be removed by a fijnal rinse in fresh water if the prints or films are to 
be permenent.

I bought mine from Bostick and Sullivan. According to the blah blah on 
Lotus web site, the importer in the U.S., it's very similar to Super XX. 
Bergger is a very confidential company, by 21st century standard. They're 
also doing a paper said to be the old Guilleminot, very rich in silver (and 
costing its weight in gold!). Reading Sullivan and Weese, it's a film that 
could be mistaken for Super XX: thickness, old fashion emulsion, incredible 
gradation, etc... ( see http://www.lotusviewcamera.at/text_platinum_e.html )

Hi everbody,

I collect lots of feedback on the film, as I am responsible for the sales
and distribution of Bergger Products in North America.

PMK and HC110(B) seem to be the developers of choice. I've seen some people
work with developers like DK-50, but strengths and dilutions made me not
like the results. Great stain in PMK, and plenty of contrast from HC110 for
platinum prints.

BPF200 can be expanded, but don't be afraid to leave it in the developer for
a while, it does get there.

Anyone outputting onto film from film recorders, this is the stuff to use.

For you roll film fans, we are doing an initial run of BPF200 in 120 rolls.
This is a big step for Bergger, I hope we get the support we need so I can
send my daughter to college, and maybe pay for braces.

Sorry for the minor plug..

With Kind Regards,

John Horowy

Wow-YOU'RE the guy!

I love the Bergger WT paper but have run out and recently run into 
problems with getting any more- my local store is trying to get about 600 
sheets for me. I have a friend in L.A who loves it as well and was 
getting his paper from Freestyle. They are moving to a new facility and 
said it would not be availble until they moved in.

I have a package of the Silver Supreme I can't wait to try......
Thanks for the great products- send some to Portland. Oregon!

I was in Yosemite two months ago and behind the Ahwahnee I met Gordan Hutchings
with his 8x10. He is using Bergger which he gets for free, but feels it is
great regarding the amount of stain. I have had some on order with
Bostick-Sullivan but to no avail so far. Let me know if you know of a good US
source.

I recently bought a small bottle of this to try. When I spoke to someone at
Ilford they intimated that it was to be discontinued (perhaps related to the
lack of promotion it has received rather than its merits).

Hello again,

Please imagine a clean piece of paper, then try to estimate total US sales.
As with any new business I'll admit I make some conservative estimates which
have left me high and dry with some products.

I have a ton of BPF200 and papers in the delivery cycle, I'm just waiting
for it to hit the shores. Bostick and Sullivan is a very good source, which
has been very,very supportive of our productline. Freestyle is also been a
good supplier. I should mention all the dealers, as they all have their
special place in our supply channel.

As Bergger Products is a new company/ distribution channel, we may have
fallin out of the puplic eye for a brief period. This might have caused a
resistance in the purchasing cycle on behalf of our dealers.

With new ad campaigns, along with better dealer, customer support, I'm sure
things will smooth out in the near future.

At any time, if you have a supply problem, or a dealer says he can't get the
stuff, contact me directly. During this transistion, we've spent alot of
dough airfreighting product around the planet to support customers during
these early transistion hick-ups.

With Kind Regards,

John Horowy

If I understand correctly, they decided to import the film themselves in 
the U.S., and the switch from their previous importer caused the shortage. 
Make sense? Anyway, they do have a web site with a list of dealers at http:/
/www.bergger.com/introusa.htm
 I'll call around next week, as I'm down to 3 boxes, and BPF 200 comes only 
in 25 sheets boxes... Hope it's back in the fridges.

P-S,
Just got back from San Jose California, was able to sneak away for a day to
Yosemite, first time.  Developed my negs last night and ran into a problem
with one of the rolls.  Here is the jist of my developing
Delta 100 120mm
Rodinal @1:50 for 12min @68f
Fresh ilford rapid-fixer @1:9 for 5 min.
The film came out great!, the second has a lot to be desired.  There is a
white fog ~1 inch in width going down the center of the negatives the entire
length.   The only thing different between the first and the second set of
negatives was I made a slight error.  First off, I filled my measuring cups
with water to cool them down to 68f in the sink with ice and water.  On the
second batch, I forgot to add the rodinal to the measuring cup.  I just pour
straight water into the container realizing my mistake and repoured the
water from the container back to the measuring cup, then added the
appropriate about of developer.  Then back into the container and processed
as usual.
What do you think?  I should add that this particular roll of film was in
the camera when it went through the xray scanner at the airport.

Thanks
John Kufrovich

 Try a refix in FRESH fixer mixed to the proper strength for film and it 
should clear the white area

I used ISO 125 / 12 minutes @ 68Å∫ F - this was 4x5 processed in an open tank
with agitation every 15 seconds.  This negs a just a little "hot" for my tastes
and I would do it at 11 minutes as a starting point.  BTW, I always process using
distilled water for the developer so these results should be pretty repeatable.

Thanks for the info. I did a test today exposed at 200, PMK 12mn/70Å∫F and 
pretty pleased with the results (wish I would be also with the picture...)
What I do really appreciate at printing time is the richness of the tones 
and the 'crisp' look of the final print (on Forte.)
I hope Bergger has a good quality contro and that we will get consistency 
through different batches. Specially if when they come up with the 120. 
Cheers.

Does this mean that scratches on the "base" side of 35 mm film might be in 
the gelatin only?  Could a scratch be removed by dissolving the gelatin?

Great news about the 120 for me, but maybe not for you since I am in the UK
and have pay for my son's college, and expensive tastes in designer sun
shades. Seriously, if this is coming to the UK, you will here me cheer
across the Atlantic.

Hi everbody,

I collect lots of feedback on the film, as I am responsible for the sales
and distribution of Bergger Products in North America.

PMK and HC110(B) seem to be the developers of choice. I've seen some people
work with developers like DK-50, but strengths and dilutions made me not
like the results. Great stain in PMK, and plenty of contrast from HC110 for
platinum prints.

BPF200 can be expanded, but don't be afraid to leave it in the developer for
a while, it does get there.

Anyone outputting onto film from film recorders, this is the stuff to use.

For you roll film fans, we are doing an initial run of BPF200 in 120 rolls.
This is a big step for Bergger, I hope we get the support we need so I can
send my daughter to college, and maybe pay for braces.

Sorry for the minor plug..

With Kind Regards,

John Horowy

I recently bought a small bottle of this to try. When I spoke to someone at
Ilford they intimated that it was to be discontinued (perhaps related to the
lack of promotion it has received rather than its merits).

Hmmm interesting.  I have no idea of the
chemical comp or effects of either of these
(being a relative newbie to this arcane high
end control stuff), coincidentally tho I'm
just thumbing through AA's "The Negative"
under the section detailing properties and
effects of "Special Purpose Developers" there
is a paragraph headed: "Pyrocatechin
(catechol)"

Just to stress I'm not doubting Barry's firm
"No".

Yes pyrocatechol, pyrochatechin ,catechol,1,2-benzenediol and 
1,2-dihydroxybenzene are the same compound. Merck Index ref 8183.
It is used in photography and also as antiseptic.

The Merck Index uses pyrocatechol and pyrocatechin as synonyms, as is 
catechol itself.......and then comes all of the technical stuff.  Barry's 
comment may relate to the way in which the two names are used in the retail 
market - such as solution concentrations, etc., purity.  But, chemically 
speaking, they are the same thing, 1,2-Benzenediol.

According to mr Jones (not his real name I have the feeling, he used to
call hymself Smith before..;-)..) at the excelllent site:

http://www.jetcity.com/~mrjones:

they are the same:

CATECHOL 
Other names: Pyrocatechol; pyrocatechin; 1,2-benzenediol;
1,2-dihy-drpxybenzene; o-dihydroxybenzene; 1,2-phendiol; Kachin (trade
name). 
Description: Colorless or white crystalline compound that has a slight
phenolic odor and sublimes or volatilizes with steam. The solid
discolors upon exposure to air
and light. Alkaline solutions rapidly turn brown or black. 
Precautions: Catechol is considered more toxic than hydroquinone. It
should be handled with care, and contact with the skin, eyes, and
inhalation of the dust should
be avoided. Wear safety glasses and rubber gloves when handling the
solid or solutions. Wash thoroughly after handling. Do not swallow. 
First Aid: In case of contact, immediately flush eyes or skin with
plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. If swallowed, induce vomiting
by giving a glass of water
containing two teaspoonfuls of table salt. Call a physician at once. 
Photographic Formulas: Modified Windisch Catechol Film Developer,
Pyrocat-HD Film Developer, Warm-Tone Redevolper.

I think he used the wrong fix dilution. I don't have any Ilford fix here to
check but from memory I thought the Ilford fix was diluted 1 - 4 for film,
whereas he said he diluted 1-9, which I thought was the print dilution.

Sorry. My stupid mistake. I should learn to read. I get so used to being
asked 'are Pyrogallol and Pyrocatechol the same thing?' that this is the
question I answered. Pyrocatechol, Catechol, and Pyrocatechin are all the
same thing. They aren't the same as Pyrogallol or Pyrogallic acid, though
these latter two are the same as each other. Apologies everybody.

Hmmm interesting.  I have no idea of the
chemical comp or effects of either of these
(being a relative newbie to this arcane high
end control stuff), coincidentally tho I'm
just thumbing through AA's "The Negative"
under the section detailing properties and
effects of "Special Purpose Developers" there
is a paragraph headed: "Pyrocatechin
(catechol)"

Just to stress I'm not doubting Barry's firm
"No".

You are right of course. See my earlier apology. It is also used in hair

The Merck Index uses pyrocatechol and pyrocatechin as synonyms, as is
catechol itself.......and then comes all of the technical stuff.  Barry's
comment may relate to the way in which the two names are used in the retail
market - such as solution concentrations, etc., purity.  But, chemically
speaking, they are the same thing, 1,2-Benzenediol.

According to mr Jones (not his real name I have the feeling, he used to
call hymself Smith before..;-)..) at the excelllent site:

http://www.jetcity.com/~mrjones:

they are the same:

CATECHOL
Other names: Pyrocatechol; pyrocatechin; 1,2-benzenediol;
1,2-dihy-drpxybenzene; o-dihydroxybenzene; 1,2-phendiol; Kachin (trade
name).
Description: Colorless or white crystalline compound that has a slight
phenolic odor and sublimes or volatilizes with steam. The solid
discolors upon exposure to air
and light. Alkaline solutions rapidly turn brown or black.
Precautions: Catechol is considered more toxic than hydroquinone. It
should be handled with care, and contact with the skin, eyes, and
inhalation of the dust should
be avoided. Wear safety glasses and rubber gloves when handling the
solid or solutions. Wash thoroughly after handling. Do not swallow.
First Aid: In case of contact, immediately flush eyes or skin with
plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. If swallowed, induce vomiting
by giving a glass of water
containing two teaspoonfuls of table salt. Call a physician at once.
Photographic Formulas: Modified Windisch Catechol Film Developer,

I thought that some might like to see the reply I received on Bergger BPF
200.
The two attachments open to the same page on my computer. They are product
info sheets that give filter factors, dev times and  reciprocity times along
with general information.

I just received this product info sheet from the Bergger folks. Thought that
I would share it with anyone who is interested. The reciprocity info was in
a graph which I do not know how to copy. It's approx. the same as Tmax100
for the first 100 seconds as far as I can tell.
I thoughtlessly sent a forwarded email to the group with the text in an
attachment, sorry again. Hope this helps!

BERGGER BPF 200
a new sheet film for large format
This new sheet film material originates
from France and even though its new its a
classic: The emulsion, rich in silver, with
high edge definition and extensive exposu-
re latitude is produced according to a for-
mula similar to Kodak's legendary Super
XX. This sheet film is especially meant for
the exacting developer for it returns such
flexibility in working with a wide tonal
range which modern, low silver emulsions
unfortunately are not able to offer.
Ideal for Pyrogallol and other specialities.
With a sensitivity of 200 ISO this sheet
film is good-natured, optimal for the Zone
System and has a wide tonal range.
This film is also excellent for all alterna-
tive processes for which an enlarged
negative is necessary.
Available in all inch sizes from 4x5  up
to 20x24 and metric formats upon request.
Development times (as a guideline)
Developer
D76 1:1      13.30
HC 110 (B)      6
Rodinal 1 + 50      12
Rodinal 1 + 25      6.30
PMK Pyro 8 -      11 minutes
Filter factors
The factors are intensity scale factors, but
in most cases exposures can be increased
by using either a larger aperture or a slo-
wer shutter speed. Mulitiply a metered ex-
posure by the filter factor to approximately
the new setting. (s. table)
Reciprocity Characteristics
For exposures between 1/2 and 1/10000 se-
cond, no corrections are needed for recipro-
city law failure. When exposures longer
than 1/2 second are given, BPF 200 needs to
be given more exposure than indicated by
a meter. Use the following graph to calcula-
te the increased exposure time which
should be used once the measured time is
known. {NOT ABLE TO COPY GRAPH}
Because the sensitivity could be inconstant
among different charges we recommend to
make own testings for exposure times
which are outside the graph.
Exposure correction by using different filters

All this talk about Bergger - I was wondering what you
folks think about their VC fiber based papers? Better
than the Ilford and Kodak FB stock I can get locally?
Worth trying?

the Bergger WT: Best warm tone paper I've ever tried- I regularly use 
Oriental Seagull G which is cold tone) as  my personal favorite- when an 
image seems to be calling out for a warm tone I use the Bergger.  Next 
best for me would be Agfa Classic which falls between the two in tone.
The Nuetral tone Bergger is very blue- but I haven't played with it in 
the Selenium toner to see where it can go...

Bergger papers are Definately worth trying.

John Horowy, the importer, will be at the Mammoth Camera Workshop next week
in Utah(Tillman Crane's excellent workshop). I and others will have more
opportunity to work with the Bergger with John supplying it for the
workshop. Will post a bit more on it after a few darkroom sessions.

I have been using it and the stuff is very nice.

   Maybe not so new (who knows?).
   Kodak now has a Kodak Sepia II Toner along with the long-marketed Sepia 
toner. It is an indirect toner (bleach and re-develop) type supposed to 
yield "much warmer tones" than the older formula. Its mentioned in only a 
couple of publications on paper. A search of the Kodak site doesn't turn it 
up nor is it listed in the MSDS.
   At a guess it has a variant bleach.
   I am not sure what "warmer" means. Indirect toners tend to be very 
yellow and are suitable for neutal or cold tone papers which do not tone 
well in direct type toners.
   I am writing to Kodak to try to find out more.
   Has anyone out there actually used this stuff?  If so, what is it like.

Bergger Papers?

Tighter grain, better range than Ilford Galleria, but the VC ... never tried
it.

Compared to Agfa?  Not possible, Agfa is way more grainey.

Your right, after careful examination of the ilford fixer bottle, it states
1:9 for prints.  I guess I got confused with the terms 1:9 for greater
economy and thought it meant film.  I'll refix tomorrow, let you know if it
corrects my problem.  The first batch seems to fix correctly using the same
fixer.  Perhaps the fixer was exhausted after one use @1:9.

   Once in a while someone talks about grain of printing paper. I don't 
know what this means. The grain of paper is microscopic, much finer than 
any film. Perhaps it means the way the paper reproduces film grain???

Hi John - Thanks for the response. When I mentioned the fixer dilution, I
didn't mean that I thought it was the source of your problem. I guess it
conceivably could be but I wouldn't have thought that exhausted fix  created
a white streak down the center of the film.  When I've used exhausted fix it
has just resulted in the film being purple after the fixing stage and that
can be corrected by refixing. I mentioned the possible dilution problem
mostly for future reference. If it  does  turn out to be the source of your
problem, I'd like to know. Brian

What I found while doing a book project and printing on several papers to
find the consistency desired for the overall  publication, was the evedence
of grain actually perceiveable and with other papers using the same
chemicals, equally fresh, etc. etc ... Bergger papers printed with a
consistent range and the other papers showed the dots of grain in shadow
areas after full shadow areas were developed in both Glycinand heavy HQ
(Ansco 130 + Edwall Ultra Black) developers.

The grain was evedent.

After telephone converations with both Steve White and Ike Royer of Luminos
and Cachet, respectively; the manufacture of photographic papers, while
accomplished at the same factories, have many crutial properties subject to
supervision by various companies' reps.   The different interpretations of
what is economical and what makes up a certain formula is -- even with the
exact same specifications -- subject to an interpretation that may be
different and produce different results.

I found the Bergger graded papers to be 1) confusing in the nominclature and
had trouble differentiating which one to re order, but with respect to their
uality it was consistent and brought life to shadow detail that was
continuous with more range showing on the print and lessspots, or grain in
the overall picture with image printed with the same enlargement the grain
structure of papers was not too different with respect to film as was film
with respect to developers.  Manageable.

All in all I found the Bergger papers responsive to thin negatives to render
detail where other papers were less than satisfactory.

I have discoverd, afterall these tests, the base paper color is too creamy
for my taste.  And, the soft silver paper is no different than Luminos,
which requires a taste for, perhaps selenium soft as a developer; but their
claim that it represents Platinum is misleading, because the asset of
printing Platinum emulsions is to achieve a contrast range far greater than
wht can be offered with silver, even using split contrast techniques and
theDeBeers formulas or variations thereof.

Try contact printing on Azo and you may get even greater detail than with
some platinum formulations.

  I have some of this film to try and already have some XTOL.  Just curious
if anyone has tried this developer with the Bergger film and could comment
on it.

This has got to be film grain, or some other processing malfunction. Paper
grain is simply microscopic

What I found while doing a book project and printing on several papers to
find the consistency desired for the overall  publication, was the evedence
of grain actually perceiveable and with other papers using the same
chemicals, equally fresh, etc. etc ... Bergger papers printed with a
consistent range and the other papers showed the dots of grain in shadow
areas after full shadow areas were developed in both Glycinand heavy HQ
(Ansco 130 + Edwall Ultra Black) developers.

The grain was evedent.

After telephone converations with both Steve White and Ike Royer of Luminos
and Cachet, respectively; the manufacture of photographic papers, while
accomplished at the same factories, have many crutial properties subject to
supervision by various companies' reps.   The different interpretations of
what is economical and what makes up a certain formula is -- even with the
exact same specifications -- subject to an interpretation that may be
different and produce different results.

I found the Bergger graded papers to be 1) confusing in the nominclature and
had trouble differentiating which one to re order, but with respect to their
uality it was consistent and brought life to shadow detail that was
continuous with more range showing on the print and lessspots, or grain in
the overall picture with image printed with the same enlargement the grain
structure of papers was not too different with respect to film as was film
with respect to developers.  Manageable.

All in all I found the Bergger papers responsive to thin negatives to render
detail where other papers were less than satisfactory.

I have discoverd, afterall these tests, the base paper color is too creamy
for my taste.  And, the soft silver paper is no different than Luminos,
which requires a taste for, perhaps selenium soft as a developer; but their
claim that it represents Platinum is misleading, because the asset of
printing Platinum emulsions is to achieve a contrast range far greater than
wht can be offered with silver, even using split contrast techniques and
theDeBeers formulas or variations thereof.

    Platinum has some self-masking properties, these are common for 
printing out processes. They result in what ammounts to a very long toe. 
Exposure tends to desensitize those areas exposed. In the case of POP there 
is an actual gain in density, so exposure is reduced in those areas.
    Its pretty hard to duplicate this effect in a developing out silver 
paper. It is more than simply low contrast, or a toe; the final density 
depends on the history of the exposure.
    Properly done Platinum prints can have pretty high overall contrast and 
good Dmax. The Dmax will never be quite equal to a silver print because of 
the roughness of the reflective surface and lack of a reflective substrate. 
However, those who have seen really good Platinum know that it is not well 
reprenseted by those washed out looking things sometimes seen.
    I have seen silver prints, and for that matter, made some, which 
resemble platinum. The main quality was a certain softness of lighting and 
the color of the image. In particular, some portraits I shot on T-Max 400, 
processed in D-76 1:1 and printed on the old Ilford Multigrade RC paper. 
Dick Sullivan thought at first that the mounted prints were platinum :-)
   BTW, I got a response back from Thom Bell who says the new Kodak Sepia 
II Toner will be available in a couple of weeks. Its already listed in the 
new version of CIS-171, a list of toning procedures for Kodak papers, 
available from the Kodak web site. http://www.kodak.com  click on "Search" 
and type in "CIS-171".  The old toner will also continue to be available.
   One of the papers it should work well for is Azo.
   In my experience the old toner never completely bleached the shadows of 
many papers resulting in split or cold sepia tones. The new toner is 
supposed to do better with these resulting in a better reddish sepia.

 I'm looking at an Osaka lens --400 tele.  I have it for trial and I
tested it by shooting targets and looking at the results. F16/22 seems
very sharp and contrasty. The lens does seem to fall off quite a bit in
resolution
by f/45-64 as would be expected - is this worse for tele's?.
   My question is this - I understand that the lens is a "Tele-Tessar" and
would like to know any
characteristics of this formula. At what stop do you get the
aberrations under control.... the usual 2 stops or so from wide open?
  Is there focus shift when stopping down?
Is there some info on this type of lens readily available?
 It seems a very good lens compared to a slightly longer Nikor { far
less coverage than the Nikor though}  and the multicoating seems to fight
flair quite
well. I just don't have another Tele to compare it with.
My test were shot on Velvia and just checked by eye{ 10x loupe}. I'm
wondering about the quality as I might try to use this lightweight
tele for backpacking but wanted to know something other than my own
subjective opinion. It sure beats the other lenses of similar focal
length, that I've worked with, in the size and weight category. This
is the first one I have ever seen and I'm hesitant to purchase without
additional info.
Thanks!
Chuck

Is it an f8 lens? If it is, it was designed for 4x5, Tele type with infinity
focus at 6.30 inches. It is a 31 degree lens covering 220mm @ f16. It is a 4
element air spaced design. Probably made for the small Horseman field cameras
in their popular time of life.

Lorena;

         They said that they had replaced the sodium bisulphite with sodium 
metabisulphite, but it might not have made any practical difference.... or 
so says Merck.

8533. Sodium Bisulfite. Sodium acid bisulfite. HNaO3S ......... The 
bisulfite of commerce consists chiefly of sodium metabisulfite, Na2S2O5, 
and for all practical purposes possesses the same properties as the true 
bisulfite.

The Merck Index, 11th Edition, 1989.

         If this also true of what is available to us as photo chemicals, 
then the two commercial products are actually the same chemically, and you 
can substitute sodium metabisulphite for sodium bisulphite 1:1 in your formula.

Crystalline sodium bisulphite is not stable by itself. It is selling in 
solution (20 to 30%) which are not also very stable and decomposed in
sulphur dioxyde which is very toxic. It is much more easier to replace it by
sodium metabisulphite which is the stable crystalline (solid) form and gives
in water solution sodium bisulphite. No problem you can replace bisulphite
by the metabisulphite (or sodium pyrosulphite) and roughly 0,7g of
metabisulphite is equivalent to 1g of bisulphite.

Yes it's f/8.
I know that there were good and bad Tessar designs and wonder how the
Tele-tessars rate.
 Being a four element air spaced lens would it have any of the same
characteristics of the Artars?
Does the Tele design completely change the characteristics of the Tessar
design?
 There is an ApoNikor Tele { 360mm f/8} that seems to be my only other
competitor choice. There is what I would call a "huge" price difference.
 in case you're wondering the Osaka is the lower priced , LOL! }
 I'm hoping to find out that this lens design like some other classic
designs will perform well and that it does not have any hidden design flaws
I'm not able to spot in my simple test. { Buying unknown- used lenses isn't
my favorite way of shopping but my budget says to check hard! }
Thanks,
Chuck

Allow a minor dissent.  "Tessar" is a registered trade-mark of the Carl
Zeiss concern at Oberkochen.  Zeiss has, since 1902, made good Tessar
lenses and better Tessar lenses, but it has never made a "bad" Tessar.

Other manufacturers, using the design once the patent expired in 1922, have
been all over the board.  Some, such as Leitz/Leica and Voigtlander, have
never made a bad Tessar-derived lens, either.  But other makers can chintz
a bit, and some of their products range from poor to mediocre to outstanding.

But there has never been a "bad" Tessar design.  The original Rudolph
formula as improved by Wandersleb, is simply an outstanding design in all
regards.

Just recently I was looking through the shelves at my photo-chemical 
suppliers. After discovering that they didn't have any sodium bisulphite in 
bulk form, I checked the inside the box of a premeasured ABC pyro developer 
kit. They had replaced the bisulphite in the kit for sodium metabisulphite. 
Wouldn't this make a fairly substantial difference to the formula?

Thanks
Lorena Carrington.

Ok, Lets just say when judged by modern standards that that some of the
designs were not always great performers! Will "not great" suffice for a
replacement for "bad". My apologies to Rudolph.
 I'll have to claim ignorance about the Zeiss made lenses in general but the
Xenar comes to mind when I think about the "bad-Tessar designs made by
others.. I'm not sure if they were pure Tessar  designs { Schneider claims
Taylor modified design} but they sure could be poor performers unless used
as long focus! I've had several of the Linhof Xenars and lets just say I
don't want any more unless at least the 210 6.1 is used on 4x5 .  The center
is fine but the outer part of the image circle is just passable at best. The
Xenars would probably be fine for non view-cameras { I've got a couple on
Rollie TLRs that work well } Also I spent several years doing Aerial
Photography and we used longer Tessars { from Zeiss } that were not on
anyone's favorite lens list.. I will admit that the normally used Wild
Lenses are a high standard for the low-priced Tessars to match.
 Since the Tessar is said to be the parent of the Xenars I am wondering if
the Tele-Xenars are likewise offspring of the Tele-Tessars. I've had both
the TeleArtons and TeleXenars and know their qualities. If they are equals
to the TeleTessar then I would have a reference point to judge the Osaka by.
I would only have to hope that Osaka makes a good copy. { I sell large
prints as a living and would not worry if I were making 20x24 or smaller
prints}

I beg to differ, at least as far as mine is concerned. I have a 150/5.6 
Schneider engraved Linhof on the barrel, and it is an excellent lens from 
16-22. Center and 'outer part'. I learned the hard way not to try to use 
camera movements, except fro very slight corrections. I use mine for 
landscapes, and occasional environmental portraits, and very pleased with 
it.
Best regards.

Camera movements ARE in my opinion a necessary component of good view camera
lenses. As I said using the center of the lens only will work well on fixed
axis cameras like the TLRs.{ or where rear tilt only will be used }
I need at least enough movement to render a scene without converging tree
tops or spreading building tops and coverage is the only way to get there
often. I shoot a 90 Angulon and 135 Xenar on a backpacking camera to save
weight but have to restrict my images a bit too much at times. { I found an
ApoSymar much better and even ended up trading it for a 120 Nikor SW for the
needed coverage.}  For scenics you can tilt the camera slightly forward and
use the back to straighten the convergence - in effect using rear tilt only.
Works most of the time but is really not what I would want to be forced into
in many cases. I shoot in heavy forest areas in the mountain areas  and
often can not use any more foreground than necessary. { too much
undergrowth} so using the front tilt to improve DOF is my only choice.
Likewise the valleys are often the main focus of attention and the sky needs
to be cropped as much as possible.  If I shot on flatter land I probably
could do with out as much movements so please judge what I like to shoot as
where my preferences come from. I often hear about Ektars in the 200mm+
range as being "tack sharp" and this would affirm the quality of the Tessar
designs as being very good if not great lenses when the outside of the
coverage isn't used. My Angulons and Xenars are older lenses I bought in the
60's for college.  They are good enough for me to use for limited field
lenses even though I have their more modern brothers for shooting any thing
I can reach by day hiking or shooting near the car.
 Boy, I did not want to get into any lens wars as I know very little about
them compared to Richard K. and others. I wouldn't be begging any info
available on the Tele-Tessar if I knew the first thing about them. I'm more
in the class of photographers that can compare lens groups if I know that
they are composed of similar lenses. In other words I'm pretty good at
knowing all kinds of thing about lenses if someone has digested all of the
technical stuff for me and I can read a paragraph or two of their opinions
:o)

No no, no need for any kind of war on a 'civilized' email list like pure-
silver :-)
I do understand your needs in terms of photography, even if over here, a 
tree is more something you see in books and magazines than for real, out 
there in the Chihuahuan Desert...
Cheers.

   I haven't joined this discussion before because I have little practical 
experience with the Tele-Tessar. Telephoto lenses generally have limited 
coverage compared to a "standard" lens of the same focal length. In 
addition the optical center (second principle plane to be technically 
correct) around which a lens should move for camera movements is displaced 
from the physical position of the lens, that is in fact what makes it a 
telephoto type. So, tele lenses are not good choices where movements, 
espcially front movements, are to be used, although some adjustment is 
certainly possible.
   Telephoto designs tend to have problems with geometric distortion. 
Modern tele's are ususally pretty well corrected for this.
   I find at least three variations of the Tele-Tessar. The original f/6.3 
lens is layed out something like a standard Tessar as far as elements but 
should not be compared to a standard tessar for performance 
characteristics. Later, and faster,  Tele-Tessars,are more complex. I 
simply don't have performance information on them.

   As far as generic lens designs, the quality of an actual lens is 
affected by all sorts fo things beyond the design. Accuracy of manufacture 
being an important factor.
   A design, like the Tessar, is really only a starting point for the 
designer. He/she must decide on performance details, cost, etc., and work 
with available glass. There have been several designs done at Zeiss since 
Rudolph's original. It is not possible, BTW, to duplicate Rudolph's 
original design now because the glass types he used have been discontinued.
   The performance of lenses made to a generic type can vary tremendously. 
 From lenses I've been able to examine the Kodak Ektar is outstanding, 
pre-war Zeiss Tessars are excellent, and evidently pretty consistent, the 
Xenar made for press cameras tends to have too much coma and must be 
stopped down a lot to be sharp in the corners, the Wollensak Raptar/Optar 
is very similar, being extremely sharp in the center of the field even wide 
open but needing to be stopped down to f/22 before the coma disappears from 
the aerial image. The Xenar in the Rolleicord and Rolleiflex does _not_ 
exhibit this coma. The f/3.5 lens is evidently a different design from the 
f/4.7 version. I also have a 8-1/2" Wollensak Velostigmat which is free of 
excessive coma and very sharp. This is a pretty limited data base to make 
generalizations on .
   The problem with lens wars is that the sort of answer people are looking 
for can be gotten only with modern lens testing, and then of several 
examples to be sure the differences are not due to manufacturing 
variations. Someone with access to a proper optical bench and associated 
equipment would be able to answer questions about the relative merrits of 
Contax vs: Leica, Nikon vs: Cannon, Zeiss vs: Schneider, Rodenstock vs: 
Schneider, and etc to infinity.
   This would still not tell you much about how actual pictorial images 
look or Bokeh or other subjective stuff.
   The accomplishments of the early pioneer lens designers is astounding. 
They had to think out the ideas behind the lens designs and calculate them 
in a long and painful way. Modern design stands on the shoulders of these 
men and it further made much easier by computer progams and much better 
optical glass. The glass is very important. High index and low dispersion 
glasses allow thinner elements and less curved surfaces, allowing much 
reduced aberrations, and allow much better chromatic correction. Kodak's 
lenses are so fine partially because they had the most advanced glass in 
the world at the time (they also had some very good designers and were 
meticulous in manufacture). They also had Rudolph Kingslake.
   Those interested in lens design software should search for OSLO. There 
is a freeware version which will accomodate 12 surfaces, which is enough to 
evaluate most pictorial lenses. It has a good graphical interface and is 
not too hard to learn. A much more powerful program is KDP (Klein's Design

Speaking of Tessar lenses, I have one for sale if anyone wants it. 35$.

It's a 150mm f/4.5 Carl Zeiss Jena in a focussing mount and mounted on a
Graflex board. No shutter. Focus marks in feet. Not coated but clean,
scratch-free, etc. F stops from f/4.5 to f/45. This is a pre-war (WWII)
lens, BTW. 

Be seeing you.

This is simply untrue, Richard.  Schott cheerfully offers to produce ANY
glass you wish, for an appropriate fee -- hell, they advertise this
world-wide.  If you are trying to say that it is no longer commercially
possible to produce an original Rudolph Tessar at a competitive price, as
the original glasses are no longer in regular production, so be it.  But
"not possible" makes my eyes bulge.  And from you, of all folks!

Hello all,

I am just starting in Large Format photography and am trying to get to
grips with DOF for the lenses I have.

I have checked the Schneider web page (
http://www.schneideroptics.com/large/depth/depthof.htm ) for the DOF
tables for my lenses.
I notice that the DOF figures are different for 4x5in format and 6x9cm
formats for the same focal length lenses.
Can anyone explain the criteria(in simple terms) that are used to give
these different figures. My guess is that either they are based on
enlargment to the same size from the different format sizes in order to
give the same resolution in the print or that they are based on the
different format negatives having the same resolution at the edge of the
negative.

Thanks in advance,

Rob Champagne

There's another way if you are prepared to sacrifice a small margin on each
print. Squeegee or mop off the wet print with photo-blotting paper so that
it is just damp. Lay it on a sheet of glass face up being sure to eliminate
any air bubbles under the print. Using gummed parcel tape (i.e. with a damp
activated gum on its reverse) stick the print to the glass using the tape
right round its edges with no gaps left - so that 100% of each print edge is
covered with the tape including the corners. Leave the print to dry as
slowly as possible, ensuring that the tape remains gummed to the print
edge - smooth it down occasionally during the early stages. As the print
dries it will shrink a little, but be gripped by the gummed tape which will
also hold down the edges perfectly flat.
When the print has dried completely, use a very sharp craft knife or scalpel
to slit through the gummed tape to release the print from the glass. Trim
the gummed tape overlap on the print edges off using a guillotine. Soak the
glass in water to release the surplus gummed tape, and the gum residue will
wash off the glass too. Result? One very flat fibre base print, but slimmed
down a little from its starting size.

there is a trick, but can only be done with thick paper, I mean works with
ektalure and similar papers, but doesnÅ¥t with agfa record rapid (because is
thiner). All you have to do is to press the wet print with a print roller on
a
flat surface , like you do when ferrotiping, press the print and use a cloth
to
absorb the water till it is stucked to the surface and you see no more water
escapes from the print, leave to dry 5 minutes, then release the print from
the
surface and leave to dry on a flat place with a cloth, the print will dry
more or
less flat.
    Seems to be difficult but it isnÅ¥t, since you can have many window
glasses and
dry pieces of cloth, you can stuck many prints in many glasses, and when you
finished stucking the last you can start releasing the prints and leaving
them on
a table with a cloth.
    Remember that if you leave much time the print in contact with the glass
it
will start to ferrotype, and if you try to release it you will break it, in
this
case use water to separate it from the glass.

Were you to make a 4x5 picture with your view camera and simply put a 6x9 back 
on the camera after making the 4x5 negative, you would have the same DOF in 
both negatives.  However, if you tried to make "the same picture," you'd need 
to move the camera back with the 6x9 to cover the same area and since you are 
farther from the subject, the DOF at the longer distance at any given aperture 
will be greater.  This is a bit of a slippery slope since by moving the camera, 
you are not really getting the same picture because you will change the 
perspective.  A beeter way to think of it is to get the same picture in 6x9 as 
4x5, you need to use a shorter lens.  Then, ceteris paribus, DOD will be the 
same for both formats.

    Does anyone has heard about the possibility to burn VC papers under the
filter 5 ( for example filter 1 is above or under the lens and you burn the
wanted area by handling and moving filter 5) .This is supposed to give
prints where burning is much less visible.

I can't find the original message so forgive me if this has been mentioned,
but a good resource on toning is Eddie Ephraums book called "Creative
Elements".

I found it at Barnes and Noble.

when sending off b/w film to kodak (tri-x) for 4*6 prints, i suppose they
let the machine do it's thing, right? or do they adjust for contrast,
exposure, etc? 
(after going thru a brick of tri-x and a 100sht box of 8*10 paper, i know
what my negs can print like, but was VERY disappointed with a roll of
portraits and another of cycad cones/gardenia buds)

Oy, vey!

Kodak, or any "autoprinter" as you call them, would be the last place on 
earth I would ever send my prints if I didn't want to do 'em myself (which 
isn't very likely in this lifetime!!)

I don't know where you are located, but scout around for a custom printer; 
more expensive no doubt, but worth it--if you let them know specifically 
what type of output you're after, maybe bring some samples of images you 
consider comparable in tone & mood, I'd bet my paper budget you'd be 
enormously more satisfied!

Where do you live?

There are a couple very good 'mass production' labs who can do what you
want; but to do what you have in B&W tanks or even tray development is
quick, easy and not at all expensive.

No no, i wanted to do them myself, but there are no darkrooms in the
vicinity of my city (Redlands, CA, USA) other than those at school, and
you have to be in class to use those (been there, done that). So, still
addicted to the Tri-X bug, sent then off to Kodak who not only charged
US$16 per roll to dev/print 36exp of 4x6 gloss prints but they also fudged
them up. I'm going to demand reprints this afternoon. How can they mess
two rolls? Gack! Anyhow, the following took six (6) hours of salvaging in
scanning and PhotoShop:

You don't need a darkroom to process film.
Why not use a changing bag a two reel tank and 2 bottles of chemistry and 
process them yourself .
Later when you get to a darkroom you can print them...

The place I buy my rubber stamps sells "Mark II" ink by Specialty Inc,
Deer Park, NY.  It dries quickly, but on the pad as well as the print,
so you have to do a lot of reinking (or actually, ink before each
stamping session.)  I recall a thread on this on another list, and there
were many other suggestions.  I had a real problem with stamp ink
"bleeding" on the back of Ilford post cards.  This ink doesn't.

Mark II comes with a separate solution you dab on the pad to reactivate the 
ink if/when it drys on the pad...so you don't lose any ink or ruin the 
pad...it is very inexpensive....you get it at the same store you buy the Mark 
II inks and pad.

 Hi Daniel,
 Sometimes I help teach/substitute for photo classes at the local community college. Here's a copy of the handout that I give to the students when I show them printing with more than one filter on multi-grade papers. I know I write strangely so I hope you can make sense of this and find it helpful! I think it's easier to follow when we're in the darkroom printing. Parts of it is just repeating things that I picked up in school and have really no documentation of it's fact... Perhaps others on this list will clarify if I am propagating any misinformation. thanks,
garimo

Daniel,  It is quite common to expose multi contrast papers to different
contrast filters.  Adding a 5 after a 1 will add a quick dose of dmax to your
print.  It is best to remove grade 1 before putting the 5 in place. I would say
that 95% of my printing done for customers is done with multi contrast
technique.

I don't know who originated this threat, but I developed a technique to
burn-in shadow areas withdetail never seen before.

I don't pretend this extends the range of silver prints, but the details in
the shadows come up; burning-in with little noticability is another
technique.

All instructions from the multi-contrast and Variable Contrast paper
manufacturers suggest printing the softest grade firts; then finishing the
established time with a darker grade.

What happens if you go the other way?  The dar, shadow areas lighten up.

What if there's detail in those areas?  Then, those details will show.

Will it effect the darkest dark areas in those shadow areas?  If you
establish an exposure time that will give yo the blackest black, then add
the lesser grade to bring up the details out of that shadow area and leave
the blackest black, black; it's a self answering question.

The usual ratio is 2/3:1/3 with normal being, say 21 seconds; print the #5
at 14 and the 1 1/2 at 7 and develop tosee if the blackest blackholds while
thedetail comes up.

John Sexton teaches what he calls 'flash burning' where youj burn in the
darkest blacks and then print the lighter grade all over.  Same ratios.

Eddie Ephmraus (spelling) says the same thing and adds that you can flash
the highlights to raise the threshold and when you print the #5 it fills in
the highlights that need burning.

Try it and tell us.

    Thank every body for the multiple answers about burning VC papers. What
Steve is talking about is the split printing technique for VC papers. I
agree with him is preferable to first found the right time for the blacks
you like with the filter 5 and then run multiple tests with different
exposures times with filter 0 or 00 for the hightlights. If you need some
burning it is much more easier to do it with soft filters ( much less
visible) this is called split printing you expose the sheet of paper
successively on filter 5 and then on filter 0 or 00(see recent article in
Camera and Darkroom).

    Daniel

    Another question about VC papers. When you flash VC papers which filter
do you use for flashing 5 or 0 or no filter? In any case the flashing time (
minimum time with no visible effect on the paper) should have determined
with the filter used.

It's very difficult to follow this message but he may be  operating under
the misconception that by so-called "split printing" (i.e. making the first
exposure at one contrast and a second exposure at another) you can somehow
achieve an effect not possible with a single exposure.blending the two
contrasts. Phil Davis pretty well shot this theory down in his "Photo
Techniques" magazine (under its former name) article on split printing about
five years ago, but it continues to hang around for some reason. Then again
maybe he's saying something else, who knows.

Mark II has a special ink pad you MUST use to keep it flowing.  It is a 
double sided pad that keeps the quick drying ink available...when one side 
starts to dry you close the top and flip it over using the other side of the 
pad...then the ink will flow into the dry pad now on the bottom and moisten 
it and have it ready for use when the side now in use drys..  If it totally 
drys out you can add some solution that comes with the kit to remoisten the 
ink before having to reapplying ink.

.it is really a great pad and a great ink.

Split filter printing is, IMO, the only real way to match the contrast of 
the negative exactly to the paper used.  Sure you can get there using any 
of the other ways, but for me, it is the easiest.  Not being a follower of 
Brother Phil Davis, I never read the article.  Like anything in 
photography, your mileage may vary.

So, okay my often rushed writing was less than comprehendable.

As Carmichael says below, split contrast printing is both the best way to
achieve a match in information available on any given negative, but the only
reason to use VC paper.

The question had to do with burn-in; and the same applies to exposing a
negative onto vc paper.

Phil Davis later ate his proverbial hat on that one, as I recall.

N.B. If anyone who replys can please try it before making strong
contradictory remarks, it would advance the cause.

Meanwhile, I appologize for my nocturnal writings.  But, I am not 'that guy'
and an 'I think he means ... ' notably in so much as those who replied such,
and never did split printing successfully, haven't the temerity to reach
into the explanation and look at the beginning of the thread, anyway.

I do hope the person who signs in as "Thanks" can find clarity in another
explanation if this doesn't do it.

Split filter printing is, IMO, the only real way to match the contrast of
the negative exactly to the paper used.  Sure you can get there using any of
the other ways, but for me, it is the easiest.  Not being a follower of
Brother Phil Davis, I never read the article.  Like anything in photography,
your mileage may vary.

Techniques" magazine (under its former name) article on split printing about
five years ago, but it continues to hang around for some reason. Then again
maybe he's saying something else, who knows.

Choosing filters is a part of the art.  We talk about sensitometry and the D
max or D min and within that is a range of seperation that can't print
either way unless you seperate the printing intensities with a split in the
contrast choices.

You have to go through a trial and error process to achieve an analogue that
works every time for your own style of printing, your own techinque.

The results that work for me begin with a print time with one grade, and a
print time with another.

The theory, that works contrary to the Phil Davis followers statements, is
not a matter of calculating an average but exposing the paper with BOTH
contrast grades, at a TOTAL of all the time but at a ration you have to
discover by trying one at a time.

It's a matter of a test strip or step tablet to determine how much of one
grade or another.

What I wrote in poor form earlier, was that when you print the light grade
first, dark grade second you achieve a spread better than normal but not as
good as some alternatives to silver gelatin printing processes.  If you
print the dark grade first and the light grade second, you will heighten the
detail in the shadow areas of the picture while making the print with more
information off the negative than single grade printing using traditional
burn-in and dodging methods.

I remain,

For me, printing my own photographs is pure joy.

I have learned to forget the pictures I have to fight with, sometimes learn
how to handle them later and continue to enjoy the process with easier
negatives.  It is this joy of learning new techniques that makes me want to
offer help.  Help to alleviate frustration.

What I like about passing information over the internet is using terms and
phrases that may fall short of the classroom, but we of differing language
backgrounds can fathom.  Yes, fathom,  an understanding based on a vague
measurement of exactitude.

If the exact details are not crystal clear to someone, I ignore their
difficulties in perhaps using a second language, or not.

I was trying to translate the burn-in process with the split filter process;
and I realized the person who generated this curiosity was in Brazil and may
well be making their question in a different language.  Maybe the burn-in
process was what was interesting, and the split filter technique was
interesting as an aside.

Anyway, as a personal pledge to continue the joy, I have resigned myself to
proof read so as to make it more enjoyable to those reading my sometimes
faulted typing in something other than their daily verbage/language, too.

Passing the enjoyment,
Steve Shapiro, Carmel, CA

    I am the "guy"who initially originated the first question. I am not from
Brazil but from France and as I said previously I apologised for the "bad
English" but any way the most important is to share experience and learn
from others. I usually print using split grading and split printing and I am
very happy with that. I just wanted to know from others and share better
skill from "men of the Art"

Flashing at hard grades has little or no effect other than to add density.
Flash at grade 2 or softer for best results.  There's some info about
flashing on my website

http://www.rhdesigns.co.uk/flash.htm
and also at
http://www.users/zetnet.co.uk/ktphotonics

The latter URL has some graphs showing the effects at different grades.

The reason is simple - you can dodge and burn at the two grades separately,
which can and will give you a markedly different result to a single (or
mulitple) exposure at a single contrast grade.  Dodging the hard exposure
will lighten the shadows, burning the soft exposure will darken the
highlights.  It's fair to say that a split-grade exposure with no burning
or dodging can be duplicated by a single exposure at an equivalent filter
setting, but the ability to manipulate the highlights and shadows
separately is extremely valuable.

Steve's technique of printing the hard exposure first suggests to me that
his negs may be generally of low to medium contrast - I find higher
contrast negs are more suitable if you print the highlights first at a soft
grade and then fill in the shadows with an exposure at a hard grade.  But
use whatever works for you - there's no hard and fast rules in this game :-)

Now I'm confused. As I understand it, different coloured filters alter
the characteristic curve of multigrade paper - in other words, the
function that relates
the amount of light falling on the print to the density obtained. When
you pre-flash, there is no negative in the enlarger carrier - so surely
contrast grade is irrelevant because every part of the print gets the
same amount of light? Of course, the exposure time may be affected by
using different filters, because the higher-grade multigrade filters
have a greater neutral density effect.

I think I'm right - otherwise RH designs would surely have provided a
means of attaching multigrade filters to the front of their
paperflasher? :)

Daniel ;

I don't know if I can help at all.  I don't know what you mean by "Burning VC 
papers."

Do you mean the practice of making two exposures, one with a yellow filter 
and the second with a magenta filter?  If that's NOT what you mean then I 
have no idea what you're talking about.

If it is what you mean then I can tell you I quit using the single magenta 
filter over two years ago and will never go back.  FOR ME IT WORKS.  I could 
not begin to achieve the results with a single filter exposure that I can 
with a two-step process.  What I call burning & dodging is all but eliminated 
to make an "acceptable" print.  When I'm making the final, a print for show 
or sale, the control available in two step printing makes burning & dodging a 
selective "tweaking," rather than mandatory to get the right print.

I use Ilford VC and Fiber papers that (according to Richard Knoppow, whose 
knowledge and experience I trust completely) use three layers of emulsion.  
Each layer responding to yellow and magenta in separate and unique ways.  
Ergo:  Ilford papers produce images with two step filtration that cannot be 
duplicated with one step filtration.  As I said, It works for me.  Maybe 
another manufacturers paper can produce an identical or even "better" print 
with single filtration.

To those who insist a single filter is preferable, I wish you well.

No, it is not irrelevant if you are using VC paper. It's response to uniform
light ( I usually call it 'white light' in flashing but that could cause
confusion in the context of this discussion) is indeed very different if a
flash test strip (and a subsequent print of course) is made with a G5 filter
or a G0 filter. Just test it out and see.

Re your other point, I believe Richard was planning a facility for including
filters in the paper flasher. I don't know if this came about but I expect
he will tell us.

In practical terms flashing with unfiltered light gives very good control on
both graded and VC papers and if used judiciously will serve most of your
needs very well

Could you let us know where we might find the place where Phil Davis' "ate
his hat" on this point? I've attended two of Phil's workshops and, whille
they dealt mostly with other things, there was never any suggestion that his
findings as outlined in the article were incorrect (and if fact, if you read
the article, they seem to me to make a lot of sense).

As far as I am concerned, any way you want to print is fine, but to suggest
that split printing is the only reason to use VC paper is just silly.
Burning in at a different contrast than the overall print, sure (plus the
saving in money and space from not having to buy and stock multiple grades),
but split printing of the overall exposure is hardly the only reason to use
VC paper.

Richard - I (and Phil Davis in his article) was talking about the technique
that some people use of making two overall exposures at different contrasts,
not to burning at a different contrast than the overall expsore. I certainly
agreethat  the ability to burn at a different contrast than the overall
exposure is a definite advantage of VC papers. Sorry if my message wasn't
clear.

You may be right, below; but I don't know what an RH or RH designer is.

Flashing the paper overall raises the threshold values, and that means the
paper becomes (over all the area of the paper) more sensitive.  Remember, a
negative may have as much as fifteen values of seperation while the paper
only five to ten.

Yes, there are below the enlarger filters available and there are
photographers who make matts through which this 'flashing' can effect
segments or sections of the resulting photograph.

What is an RH?

Bruce - There apparently has been some confusion in this thread, at least
partly my fault for not making it clear that the "split printing" I was
talking about (and that is discussed in the Phil Davis article to which I
referred) didn't deal with using the two filters in a color head but rather
with using variable contrast filters with a black and white head. I've never
used a color head for black and white printing and so I'm not in a position
to know anything about it. However, it certainly makes sense that using the
two filters in a color head would produce better results than using only a
single filter.  Brian

Richard's assumption is correct, I am referring to 'problem' negatives of
mostly low contrast, thin with little density to seperate tones in the
picture's shadow areas.

If you are dealing with a long range, normal negative and still want the
manipulation by burn-in and in areas of finite different information, like
reeds or brush in a forest; this method to heighten detail by spliting the
grade with the darker grade second can heighten detail in these shadow areas
easily.

Actually, you can put filters in the PaperFlasher's light source - just
remove the acrylic cover and slip in a gel of your choice. We have at least
one customer who uses the device to print coloured borders on RA4 prints!

But for it's intended purpose of flashing VC paper, in practice there's
little difference between white light and the use of a soft filter.  *Hard*
filters, OTOH, simply don't work.  I suspect, and it's only a suspicion,
that this is because highlight detail is mostly rendered by the "soft"
emulsion.  Whatever the reason, our experiments revealed that soft filters
or white light give the best results.

You can of course flash just part of a print if there's a problem highlight

Yes - see my response to Guy Brown.  I guess if that's not clear from the
web page I need to edit same :-)

The characteristic curve relates light hitting the print to density
obtained. So when making a *sequence* of flashing exposures, you are
right that the flash test strip will turn out differently if different
multigrade filters are placed over the uniform light source. Density
will build up in a different way depending on the grade used, because
the underlying characteristic curve is different. Fine.

However, consider a *single* flashing/fogging exposure that gives a
particular density in the print. By changing exposure time, the same
density can be obtained with any multigrade filter. If the
characteristic curve at that grade is steep, then a shorter exposure
will be required than if the curve is shallow. So, we can always trade
exposure time against grade in order to get the same density from a
flashing/fogging exposure. This is what I really meant by "irrelevant" -
there is no point in varying the grade, because the same effect can
always be obtained by changing exposure time. The usual reason for
changing grade - to alter the relative density in highlights and shadows
- doesn't apply in the case of flashing because the light source is
uniform (there are no highlights and shadows!).

All the above only applies to pre-exposure flashing. I would anticipate
that results would differ according to filter grade for post-exposure
flashing, because in this case you have already got different densities
in the print.

Finally, I'd expect any difference in flashing test strips with filter
grade to be pretty small, since characteristic curves for multigrade
papers tend to be very similar in the tails, with larger differences in
the shoulders.

Am I right????

Thanks

It seems to me we are getting some 
bogus suggestions in this thread.

Exposure to photons should be additive, regardless of the order
(Subject only to "reciprocity failure" for very short and very long
exposures).  I don't see why the order should matter.

Regarding the "layers" in VC paper.  (And one note here even mentions
a "filter" layer that is washed out in the developer. )  I don't
think so.  See, for example,
http://www.ilford.com/html/us_english/pdf/mgivrc.pdf
for a description of ilford's VC emulsion.  It has 3 components, but
they are not layers.  They are all mixed together! And there is
certainly
no filter layer on B&W paper.

Regarding exposing the whole paper through one filter, or the whole
paper through 2 filters... if one does not do selective burning or
dodging, the effect is the same. (Though one might be able to select
an "in-between" grade by timing).
Basically, you are letting some number of blue photons hit the paper,
and some number of blue-green photons hit the paper.  The paper doesn't
know which hit first, or whether they were in the highlights etc.

As for whether you should use VC or graded paper, the choice is 
likely to evaporate.  The market for graded papers will probably
disappear, except for a few papers that will come only "grade 2" or
so. Because the components in VC emulsion are basically the
same material, sensitized in 2 or 3 different ways, then mixed
together and coated on the paper, the cost to manufacture VC
paper is probably not much different from graded paper, and
the volume is higher.

Guy,

Filtration grade is relevant.

Multigrade papers have two or three emusions, each sensitive to different
spectrums of light, from blue (low contrast) to green (high contrast).

If you flash with a #0 filter, you pre-sensitize the low contrast emulsion.
If you flash with a #5 filter, you pre-sensitize the high contrast emulsion.
If you flash with some filter number between to will get a proportional
mix.

Whichever emusion is more sensitized will be more responsive to additional
exposure and show  more in your print.

Cheers,

John Rogers

Well at least it has stimulated some lively debate, and possibly some useful
dissemination of knowledge/experience as well - which is all to the good.

On some of the points emerging:

You are quite right about the 'layers' in a VC emulsion.
I don't think it matters too much in this discussion though as the 'layers'
idea is really a concept that helps some people to easily explain the VC
system. The fact that they are mixed  doesn't alter much what you do in
practice in the darkroom. When I flash, or when I use different filters -
either to match the contrast of the paper to the neg - or to 'unmatch it' to
give a result I want - or to use selectively around the print to burn or
replace dodged areas in a different grade - I don't actually think whether
the emulsion is layered or mixed. I just know from practice and experience
what it will do, and in the end that is all that matters.

Photons are of course additive, and I have never found it makes any
difference in outcome which way round the grades are used in split grade
printing. I have experimented every which way on this over years, and have
taught it on workshops and had people try it all ways. I think it makes a
significant difference though in ease of interpretation - i.e. how to decide
on the combination you want from the tests you do - which way round you do
it according to the type of neg in use, and that is my criterion - but it's
what works for you that is right of course. I find it easier to use G0
first, make a G0test strip, then a G0 overall exposure and lay a G5 ( or 4.5
if you prefer) test strip on top, to get the combo I want for negs with a
predominant (or more evenly distributed) light tone - and I find it easier
to do the other way round for low key prints where I can more easily assess
the adundant shadows on G5 first. Whatever.

I don't see what difference it makes whether you use under lens filters or
as I do a B&W vario contrast head (other than the fact that the latter is
corrected for the exposure compensation at Gs 4&5)

Re flashing at different grades. Just try it out for yourself if you are not
sure. (and if you haven't tried it for yourself you should not be sure
anyway ! ) Mostly I flash with a separate unfiltered light - which has
distinct advantages.

Graded vs VC. It may well be that graded will disappear, but that isn't the
point. There are still people who use them for well known reasons and
therefor the value of flashing in the control of printing with these papers
cannot be overstated - whether it be local or general. I suspect you are
right though - they may go in due course. As may silver based papers
altogether perhaps - but that is a different issue.

Meanwhile enjoy the pleasures of making good silver prints!

No, I can't, won't and don't want to show you where somebody said anything.

I said, 'Proverbially,' ate his hat.  I claim his object lesson with that

My claim is based upon my own experiences.

I agree.  To suggest the only way to do anything is silly.  I said the only
valid reason I can see to use VC or Multigrade or polycontrast paper is for
split printing and other techniques that allow you to obtain a picture with
a longer range to better match the range achieved from your negative.

I do Sabattier on single grade and split printingon multi grades, too; and
extend the range in my highlight areas, too.  Dig into that with Phill
Davis.

We're discussing technique and a reasonable use for a particular material
given the opportunity to use them all.  Cheeper?  It's cheeper to stay home
and watch television and not use any paper.  Cheeper is never a reason to
disclaim a technique or validation of a particular materila compared to
another.

    I did not know when I sent the questions on flashing and burning VC 
papers that I will initiate so many answers with different point of view but
the discussion is very useful and full of interesting point of view.
    Now I have another question : another way to get good prints is to make
unsharp masks to meet the grade of the papers.( Photo Techniques Howard
Bond' articles 1996 and 1997).What is presently the best film(s) to make
easily unsharp masks with density adjusted to the negative. Orthochromatic
films would be preferable they are more friendly handled in the darkroom.
    Many thanks

It makes me smile today when I read of 35mm cameras with anything but fully
automatic metering systems described as 'manual' exposure. I remember the
first TTL metered cameras - the Topcon and then the Pentax Spotmatic if my
memory serves me correctly - described as the total answer to exposure
problems in the typically understated advertisements (that somehow seem very
similar in tone to those for current multi-zone matrix systems). Now they
are just regarded as 'manual'.
A couple of years ago I bought a genuinely manual Pentax SV (no meter at
all) camera in really beautiful condition (30+ years old?), and am
thoroughly enjoying using it. It is beautifully light and smooth in action,
and its f1.4 50mm lens gives results indistinguishable under critical test
from two current Pentax f1.7 50mm lenses. I work with the Zone system and
use a Pentax digital spot meter as routine so the lack of in-built meter is
no hassle, and the monochrome negatives on Delta 100 or FP4 are all that I
could wish for to print through a similarly elderly Focomat 1c enlarger with
aged f4.5 Focotar lens. The prints are critically sharp and match anything
from my current equipment.
Now I would like to add some further M42 screw thread lenses to the Pentax
outfit. I had some already from makers like Tamron, but would like to
collect and use the genuine Pentax Takumar objectives in fine condition. I
have searched through advertisements from dealers here in the UK, but can't
currently find what I want. I will keep looking, but wondered if any of you
guys out there in other parts of the world as well the UK know of dealers
who may have these items (ideally with web site lists), or of any Pentax
enthusiast groups who might have tabs on such equipment. I particularly seek
24mm, 135mm f2.5, and 200mm lenses. Any suggestions gratefully received.
Am I weird, or do any other people enjoy using, as opposed to just owning,
older equipment?

Barry, nothing weird about owning and using old equipment at all, at least if 
it is weird then there are a whole hatful of photographic "weirdo's" out 
there, me included.  I still use my Minox 35GT, it's 25 years old, had one 
rebuild by Mr Leitz after I managed to drop it and I don't have to think 
about using it!  A major benefit.  I prefer my elderly Nikon FM simply 
because I know what's going on and can control it with speed.  As for my F90X 
I have to take 2 handbooks with my and then the wretched things before a job 
because I cannot remember all the sequences (rather like my original video 
recorder that needed 3 hands).  2 handbooks because Nikons own is, in part, 
gibber, unadulterated techno babble.  The other is a third party publication 
which is better but still very wordy!

Cheers

Hi Barry

I have a Pentax S1a (US version) which is
even more basic than the SV plus a pair of
screw thread Leicas, the Leicas are in
constant use as the camera I always carry.
Older mechanical metal bodied cameras are a
joy to use IMO and often cheap compared to
the modern plastic boxes.

One of the best sources for used M42 lenses
is probably ebay, I was recently outbid on a
16mm and a 24mm M42 Asahi lens being sold as
one lot :-(, alternatively try the pentax
users group
http://www.pentax.com/discussion.html

The folllowing site has some useful links to
dealers online UK and US
http://www.smu.edu/~rmonagha/mf/albro.html

And finally I saw a 135 2.5 in the back of AP
recently.for next to nothing.

Good luck searching

Jason

"His object lesson with that claim was misquoted?" Steve, have you ever read
the article? The whole point of it  was to set forth the results of some
testing that he did concerning the question of whether split printing
produced results that couldn't be achieved with a single exposure. He
concluded, based on the test results set forth in the article, that there
was no advantage to split printing (keeping in mind that the term "split
printing" in this context refers to making  multiple overall exposures, not
to burning in portions of a print at  different contrasts, which I think
everyone agrees is a very desirable feature of VC paper).

Anyone can read the article themselves and decide that for some reason Phil
is wrong and there really is some advantage to making two overall exposures
at different contrasts,  though to me the results were very persuasive and,
more importantly, made  lot of common sense. However, whether you think that
Phil was right or wrong, I certainly didn't misquote any claims that he
made.  If it will help you any, here's the conclusion as stated at the end
of the article:  "As a result of this experience [referring to the tests and
photographs he made that are described in detail in the article] I am
personally persuaded that adjustment of print contrast affecting the entire
image can be made as effectively (and at least as easily) with a single
filter exposure as with any split filter technique - and with no discernible
difference in image density range or gradation."

When you said that he later "ate his hat" about the conclusions reached in
the article, I understood that this was said in a proverbial sense.  I
didn't think you were saying that he literally took a hat off of his head
and digested it. However, since I doubt very much that Phil ever disavowed
anything in the article, but since I also don't have a pipeline to
everything Phil does or says, I just asked that you give us the source or
basis for your statement. Since the purpose of the statement was to
discredit my original message, it doesn't seem unreasonable to ask that you
do this.

For the benefit of others who might want to read the article and form their
own conclusions, it appeared in the September/October issue of the magazine
"Photo Techniques" which back then was called "Darkroom and Creative Camera
Techniques."

Kodak used to make a film specifically for masking that was called Pan
Masking film, but it was discontinued some time ago. I don't know of any
film that is suitable for masking and that can be used under a safe light.I
think that most people do the procedure in the dark (at least that's how
I've always seen it done). Lith film can be used under a safelight but it is
a high contrast film and since you're looking for a flat mask, I wouldn't
think it would be very suitable for masking though I've never tried it. Once
you've done it a few times, it isn't hard to do the masking in the dark.
I've used both T Max 100 and APX 100 and both seem to work well.

The Topcon RE Super of 1963 was the first 35mm camera to offer TTL
metering, with a rather cumbersome mirror system;  the Asahi Pentax
Spotmatic from 1964 was the first to offer the modern system of TTL
metering.  Both required manual adjustment.  The first 35mm TTL cameras to
offer automatic exposure control were the Voigtlander Ultramatic CS and the
Zeiss Ikon Contaflex Super BC, both dating from 1965.

Daniel,
  First of all most of the folks writing about masking today are beginners.
Sorry for the putdown of the writers but few have perfected it to the point
that it is "invisible". Very heavy-handedness is apparent in most cases.
 This, with practice, can be fixed. In other words what you see in most
magazines is rather poor so expect to do better than what you see with some
refinement. I hear comments about how some of the prints made are
"distracting" and would like to assure you that it can be done invisibly and
most good printers would not be able to tell unless the straight print was
shown beside it.
Mask can be made with as little as a half stop of density that help the
sharpness effect but often the masking I see is in the 3 to 4 stop total
density range and really shows. I often feel that it is just used in support
of poor shadow detail and gets overdone rather than to explore the
possibility of better shadow contrast through a developer similar to Barry's
DiXactol.  This will allow for sometimes much better shadow detail due to
the suppression of the highlights and the full development that it allows.
Then if the mask is still wanted you can use a much more subdued mask and
not have some of the problems of overmasking.

I've tried several films even lith films in a continuos tone developer and
surprisingly all seem to be able to made to work well. Common camera films
work easiest but do have to be used in the total dark. Inexpensive punches
can be had from Wess plastics { 1-800-itswess } that will do up to 6x9 negs
{Under $100.US} - and 4x5 punches and registration devices are available for
a moderate amount of money.{ $200 dollar range -} They supply very
inexpensive slide mounts with the pin registration already in place that can
be used for roll film. { the slide mount is used to hold the negative and
mask in perfect registration and are inexpensive enough to be used for each
neg/sandwich and left in place for later printing. Even with much more
expensive equipment I now choose the Wess system for its great accuracy and
extremely easy use. For larger formats you can usually align everything by
eye but Condit and other companies offer systems for pin-registration.
 condit is said to be closing in the near future so you might be aware of
that}

 I'm including this info as there are different films for each type of mask.
  There are 4 distinct types of masks plus burn and dodge masks that will
correct local areas.
1.unsharp
2.highlight
3.midtone
4.shadow
1. The unsharp masks try to give overall masking for "edge effects" they
rarely are done in a neutral way and will flatten the contrast somewhat
which will require a higher contrast paper to compensate for the problem.
This is usually overdone and results in somewhat "strange" tones and can be
rather gaudy.
2.Highlight masks can either lower the values found in  the  highlight area
or even better sometimes they can be made to increase the contrast in the
highlights while still lowering the values of the whole range until they
will print well on regular #2 or similar paper.
3. most likely you will not need a midtone mask but one can be made to
either expand or contract the contrast of the tones normally found in the
midtones.
4. shadow masks can be made to increase the contrast in the shadows or when
used with the original neg they will both allow for another mask to be made
that will get the "final" small bit of detail from the shadows as well as
add edge effects to the overall image.
A  #4 shadowmask is the favorite of many printers looking for the ultimate
in B&W control. The same technique is used in color transparency printing
but the opposite effect is desired in that case so you use a highlight mask
and the original slide to create another mask that increases contrast in the
highlights and still gives the edge effect to the rest of the slide when
printed.
The learning curve is a bit steep at first but can be done with ease once
"your homework" is done.
Don't mean to confuse you or put you off of trying due to too much info so
apologize for the long post.
 I have several documents that might help but they are too large to include
in a post to the group. Will be glad to send them by email to anyone that is
interested. Ilford has a publication on masking for slide printing that is
easy to follow and all you have to do is reverse all the info to fit
negatives instead of slide printing. { you would make shadow mask to work
with negatives and highlight mask for the same effect in slide printing. }
 If this is all a bit much I'll try to simplify any thing you have a
question on.
 We are leaving on a photo trip and I probably won't be back in until the
middle of next week but if I can be of any help please just send an email to
natureseen@mindspring.com  and I'll send what I have.
 Next to the Zone system this is the most valuable technique that I know of.

Brian,
         Is there a place on line where this article can be read?  I don't 
have the Magazine and would like to read it.  Isn't that mag out of 
business?  Any help would be appreciated.

Brian,<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Is there a
place on line where this article can be read?&nbsp; I don't have the
Magazine and would like to read it.&nbsp; Isn't that mag out of
business?&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.<br>
<br>

At 07:12 AM 06/30/2000 -0400, you wrote:<br>
<blockquote type=cite cite>&quot;His object lesson with that claim was
misquoted?&quot; Steve, have you ever read<br>
the article? The whole point of it&nbsp; was to set forth the results of
some<br>
testing that he did concerning the question of whether split
printing<br>
produced results that couldn't be achieved with a single exposure.
He<br>
concluded, based on the test results set forth in the article, that
there<br>
was no advantage to split printing (keeping in mind that the term
&quot;split<br>
printing&quot; in this context refers to making&nbsp; multiple overall
exposures, not<br>
to burning in portions of a print at&nbsp; different contrasts, which I
think<br>
everyone agrees is a very desirable feature of VC paper).<br>
<br>
Anyone can read the article themselves and decide that for some reason
Phil<br>
is wrong and there really is some advantage to making two overall
exposures<br>
at different contrasts,&nbsp; though to me the results were very
persuasive and,<br>
more importantly, made&nbsp; lot of common sense. However, whether you
think that<br>
Phil was right or wrong, I certainly didn't misquote any claims that
he<br>
made.&nbsp; If it will help you any, here's the conclusion as stated at
the end<br>
of the article:&nbsp; &quot;As a result of this experience [referring to
the tests and<br>
photographs he made that are described in detail in the article] I
am<br>
personally persuaded that adjustment of print contrast affecting the
entire<br>
image can be made as effectively (and at least as easily) with a
single<br>
filter exposure as with any split filter technique - and with no
discernible<br>
difference in image density range or gradation.&quot;<br>
<br>
When you said that he later &quot;ate his hat&quot; about the conclusions
reached in<br>
the article, I understood that this was said in a proverbial sense.&nbsp;
I<br>
didn't think you were saying that he literally took a hat off of his
head<br>
and digested it. However, since I doubt very much that Phil ever
disavowed<br>
anything in the article, but since I also don't have a pipeline to<br>
everything Phil does or says, I just asked that you give us the source
or<br>
basis for your statement. Since the purpose of the statement was to<br>
discredit my original message, it doesn't seem unreasonable to ask that
you<br>
do this.<br>
<br>
For the benefit of others who might want to read the article and form
their<br>
own conclusions, it appeared in the September/October issue of the
magazine<br>
&quot;Photo Techniques&quot; which back then was called &quot;Darkroom
and Creative Camera<br>
Techniques.&quot;<br>

&gt; &gt; Could you let us know where we might find the place where Phil
Davis'<br>
&quot;ate<br>
&gt; &gt; his hat&quot; on this point?<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; No, I can't, won't and don't want to show you where somebody
said<br>
anything.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I said, 'Proverbially,' ate his hat.&nbsp; I claim his object lesson
with that<br>
&gt; claim was misquoted.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; My claim is based upon my own experiences.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; As far as I am concerned, any way you want to print is fine,
but to<br>
&gt; suggest<br>
&gt; &gt; that split printing is the only reason to use VC paper is just
silly.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I agree.&nbsp; To suggest the only way to do anything is
silly.&nbsp; I said the<br>
only<br>
&gt; valid reason I can see to use VC or Multigrade or polycontrast paper
is<br>
for<br>
&gt; split printing and other techniques that allow you to obtain a
picture<br>
with<br>
&gt; a longer range to better match the range achieved from your
negative.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; I do Sabattier on single grade and split printingon multi grades,
too; and<br>
&gt; extend the range in my highlight areas, too.&nbsp; Dig into that
with Phill<br>
&gt; Davis.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; &gt; Burning in at a different contrast than the overall print, sure
(plus<br>
the<br>
&gt; &gt; saving in money and space from not having to buy and stock
multiple<br>
&gt; grades),<br>
&gt; &gt; but split printing of the overall exposure is hardly the only
reason to<br>
&gt; use<br>
&gt; &gt; VC paper.<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt;<br>
&gt; We're discussing technique and a reasonable use for a particular
material<br>
&gt; given the opportunity to use them all.&nbsp; Cheeper?&nbsp; It's
cheeper to stay<br>
home<br>
&gt; and watch television and not use any paper.&nbsp; Cheeper is never a
reason to<br>
&gt; disclaim a technique or validation of a particular materila compared
to<br>
&gt; another.<br>

the contrast<br>
&gt; of<br>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the negative exactly to the paper used.&nbsp; Sure you can

"Photo Techniques" is still in business:
<http://www.phototechmag.com/index.htm>. The article is "Variable Contrast
Printing Papers Revealed" by Phil Davis, pp. 40-48 in the Sep/Oct 1994,
vol. 15, no. 5 issue of "Darkroom & Creative Camera Techniques" (former
name of "PT"). I believe this issue is out of print. It's a no-show in a
back issue search.

Ilford Ortho technical film in 5x4 is great for the job. It is continuous
tone, unlike their Line technical film which is purely high contrast. You
can use the Ortho under red safelighting, but it is not safe under orange or
typical VC paper brown coloured safelights I have found.
I use it for unsharp positive masking just like paper - exposing with a test
strip and developing by inspection in a print developer. It is very easy to
vary density and contrast by increasing or decreasing exposure and
pulling/pushing development. I sometimes double dilute the print developer
to give greater control. You soon get the feel of the right
density/contrast/unsharpness for the unsharp mask by experience and
eye-balling - it is so easy to make a modified mask if the first one doesn't
work too well, but there is nothing to stop you adopting Howard Bond's
properly measured and repeatable technique. You just don't have to go
through the whole process of testing to give it a quick try to see if you
like the effect.
Incidentally, the film is very tough and stable on its polyester base, and
after a quick wash can actually be dried off with a hairdryer if you need
the mask quickly.

Kodak used to make a film specifically for masking that was called Pan
Masking film, but it was discontinued some time ago. I don't know of any
film that is suitable for masking and that can be used under a safe light.I
think that most people do the procedure in the dark (at least that's how
I've always seen it done). Lith film can be used under a safelight but it is
a high contrast film and since you're looking for a flat mask, I wouldn't
think it would be very suitable for masking though I've never tried it. Once
you've done it a few times, it isn't hard to do the masking in the dark.
I've used both T Max 100 and APX 100 and both seem to work well.

Snipping here...

   Kodak Fine Grain Release Positive might work for B&W masking. It is an 
extremely fine grain material with an emulsion similar to printing paper. 
It is not color sensitized and can be handled under a red safelight. It 
comes in sheet film sizes as well as 35mm, not too expensive, and contrast 
can be varied somewhat depending on choice of developer. Normal developer 
is Dektol, for low contrast use D-76.
   Speed is about the same as medium speed enlarging paper.

Hi Marc
I remember the Topcon RE Super, made, I think, by the Tokyo Optical Company.
They were also the makers I believe of a 4x4 TLR I own called the Sawyers
4x4.
I didn't realise the Voigtlander and Contaflex cameras were TTL. I thought
the first auto TTL SLR was the Konica Autoreflex T with shutter speed
priority. You live and learn!

The Topcon RE Super of 1963 was the first 35mm camera to offer TTL
metering, with a rather cumbersome mirror system;  the Asahi Pentax
Spotmatic from 1964 was the first to offer the modern system of TTL
metering.  Both required manual adjustment.  The first 35mm TTL cameras to
offer automatic exposure control were the Voigtlander Ultramatic CS and the
Zeiss Ikon Contaflex Super BC, both dating from 1965.
