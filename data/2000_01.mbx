Hello All,

I am new to this list and very much hope to be an active  and enthusiastic
participant. I have much to say and very much more to ask.

My main area of interest has, for the last year, been alternative
processes- particularly Gum printing- to produce unique, one-off artworks
which are traded as such. This year I have decided to start teaching myself
how to Lith print.

I have a question, or rather an enquiry that might be off topic but
relevant, regarding the use of certificates
of provenance as given out to the buyer of an original artwork. 

I feel they are a very good idea as they indicate that the artwork has (or
will have) a
history, and hopefully will gain in value. I'm sure we would all like to
think that our work will be fetching thousands at Christies in many years
time and we will have our own little slice of history for future scholars
to theorise about. The only photographer I came across who routinely issued
these certificates slipped them inside the sealed polypropyline sleeves
that he supplied his prints in. They gave the work extra value to my eyes
and, though the inclusion of print/process/exposure details seems slightly
"techie",
historically it could be important. Imagine if Robert Demachy, Roger Fenton
or  P.H.Emerson had issued these certificates, our knowledge of 19th C.
Photographers could have been considerably enriched, with a consequent
knowledge base to draw from.

My point is, what do other list members feel about issuing these
certificates- are they an ego trip for the original image maker, do they
add to the intrinsic value of an original piece of art, does anyone else
use them?

I await any comments with interest.

Best wishes,
Julian Smart.

there is a trick, but can only be done with thick paper, I mean works with
ektalure and similar papers, but doesnÅ¥t with agfa record rapid (because is
thiner). All you have to do is to press the wet print with a print roller on a
flat surface , like you do when ferrotiping, press the print and use a cloth to
absorb the water till it is stucked to the surface and you see no more water
escapes from the print, leave to dry 5 minutes, then release the print from the
surface and leave to dry on a flat place with a cloth, the print will dry more or
less flat.
    Seems to be difficult but it isnÅ¥t, since you can have many window glasses and
dry pieces of cloth, you can stuck many prints in many glasses, and when you
finished stucking the last you can start releasing the prints and leaving them on
a table with a cloth.
    Remember that if you leave much time the print in contact with the glass it
will start to ferrotype, and if you try to release it you will break it, in this
case use water to separate it from the glass.

Just a short pure-silver update for all list members:

1) We're up to 146 subscribers - about 50% growth since the beginning of the
   year when we went live at this server.

2) Lots of subscriptions from the UK lately (welcome all) since "Camera &
   Darkroom" mentioned the list in the "Postbag..." section.  BTW, if you
   do not get this magazine, shame on you - it seems to be the last
   great magazine dedicated to B&W subjects.  Moreover, it is
   beautifully made and printed.  If interested, contact:

        ed.buziak@camera-and-darkroom.co.uk

3) There is now a pure-silver web page (quite humble - I have
   better things to do than put glitter where none is needed ;).  See:

   http://www.tundraware.com/pure-silver

   This is a convenient way to let others know how to join the list.
   There is also a brief primer on mailing lists and what they do.

4) We continue to occasionally take network outages which make the
   list and web site unavailable to the rest of the world.  These
   outages have lasted from 2 minutes to 2 weeks.  If you send a message
   to the list and it bounces or is not repeated back to you in less
   than a half hour or so, it means either server is down (unlikely -
   it is running FreeBSD which is a rock-solid version of Unix) or
   the network connection is hosed (likely because although AT&T 
   seems to know how to run a phone company, cable modems seem to be
   to complex for them - grumble).

And in parting....

Happy New Year to all of you, yours, your pets, even your in-laws
Curses upon all politicians of any stripe - they need to find real work
Happy shooting (both photographic and center-fire varieties ;)

I gotta go - I have prints to make....

Folks,

Mention of good U.K. magazines - Camera & Darkroom was quoted - I guess
you are aware of the excellent magazines published by Creative
Monochrome ?

The original, and now expanded is "Mono". Published 6 times a year. For
the last few issues, I have been writing articles therefor.

Photo Art International (PAI). Covers colour as well as b&w, but the
emphasis is on monochrome. Portfolios, print sales. Regular feature
writers Tim Rudman, Tony Worobiec and Colin Westgate.  Thoroughly
excellent.   (Sample issue recently mailed to Wade Clutton FPSA).

Digital Photo Art (DPA) is still getting there, and as its name suggests
is totally concerned with D.I.

If you are not familiar with C.Mono - and the founder and main director
- Roger Maile, then I will happily pass you the details.

You could start with email :  roger@cremono.demon.co.uk  (I think ...)

Yours,

Glyn Edmunds EFIAP, PSA2, ARPS etc..

Dear list-members:

I bought some ISO 125 Arista Pro 120 film from Freestyle.  It is made by
Ilford and is supposed to be their previous-generation technology film.

My problem:  Under examination with a loupe, I see parallel lines in the ISO
125 Arista Pro 120 negatives where there is no emulsion.  Clear acetate.
They're only about 1/2 inch in length, but would surely show up as fine
black lines upon enlargement.

Since they intermittently run the length of the film, much line the white
lines you see zipping across the raster of your TV screen at times, I
immediately thought that my C220 camera was scratching the negatives.  I
examined the entire film path with a Q-Tip, but no snags.  I am very careful
in film loading, into the camera and into my Patterson plastic reels, and
striation marks usually turn out as black/exposure lines, so I don't think
it is a dry-handling issue on my part.

Wet-handling, I do NOT squeegie my film to make it dry faster.  I also
unload it delicately from the reels when I hang it to dry.

I use the ISO 400 Arista films in 120 and 4x5 format on a regular basis and
have never had a problem.  Until yesterday, I was 100 percent comfortable
and secure in using this film line for any project - important or casual.

Is there a chance I got a "lot" of film that did not get a nice even
emulsion coating at the factory?  Or is there another reason why Ilford
sells this film under a name other than their own?

Thanks for any comments or questions,

John Shuster
Port Orchard, WA

Arista 125 is  Ilford FP-4 +.

 If there is a problem, send the remaining rolls back. I am sure that
Freestyle would like to be alerted to the possibility of a bad batch.

I suspect it's possible there was a manufacturing defect.  Every so often
I'll get a "hole" in an emulsion in 120 film.  I have never seen or heard of
a defect the extent of yours, however, and would still be concerned about
something along the film plane.  It could be worth your while to sacrifice
one roll through the camera: run it through (don't even bother taking any
pictures) then remove it from the camera and look carefully at the emulsion
side of the film in the same respective place you found scratches on the
other roll.  It should be very apparent if there is a problem.  To make sure
it isn't the camera scratching the film, you can then develop and fix the
roll.  If there is scratching you won't miss it in the black emulsion.

FWIW - the Arista film is current generation technology.  I, too, use it all
the time.  In fact, I use lots of all sizes and varieties of Arista films
and papers.  It's the best bargain on the market.  You should understand
that it is actually far too expensive for Ilford to run different emulsions
concurrently - to supply themselves and other vendors with different films
as we're talking here.  There is nothing more expensive about the new
emulsion than the old.  What costs is the R&D for the new technology
emulsions.  But that's behind them since the film technologies are already
developed and the film on the market.  My dad worked for Agfa for 30 years
and they did private label work all the time.  It was the same fresh
emulsion and technology as that sold under their own name at a greatly
reduced price.

I have found that in the sheet film sizes that the Arista is not on the same
base as the Ilford. The Arista curls much easier than its counterpart HP5
and FP4 when taken out of the box or sheet film holder. In all other
respects it seems to be the same film. When the images are important, I
would choose the Ilford with what seems to be a thicker base with less
tendency to curl.

Hello !
I you have another film from this lot, maybe you could try to process
half the film without exposing it. If you see that the lines are
present, the problem will not lie in the camera. If the lines are not
present, you could load the camera with the remaining half and see if
the lines are here after having only fixed the film.  This will ensure
that the lines are not produced by a chemical reaction with some product
in the dev. or stop bath.
If the lines are still not present, I suggest you buy these films in
batches and process one film with remaining ones not exposed to check if
the problem arises.

I am wondering myself if a thermal constraint could do some harm on the
film base ? Or if an excessive curl could cause such a stress to the
base ?
Hope this helps.

that the lines are not produced by a chemical reaction with some product
in the dev. or stop bath.
If the lines are still not present, I suggest you buy these films in
batches and process one film with remaining ones not exposed to check if
the problem arises.

I am wondering myself if a thermal constraint could do some harm on the
film base ? Or if an excessive curl could cause such a stress to the
base ?
Hope this helps.

Unfortunately, there is no digest of PS available at this time (I am lazy and shiftless ;)

I will try to get one going at some point, but time is the enemy...

No I do not. It would be of great interest to me to get the FAQ + archives. 
Where can I access this information.

I'm not sure to whomI should be addressing this reply?  Georges or Owner of 
the pure silver list, hence the reply to you both.

Thanks

& Happy New Year

Hello to you all,

I have just spent a little time experimenting with this new paper. (It is very
new; I don't know if it will have made it across to North America, yet!)

It really has me baffled. First, I would agree with Barry Thornton's review in
Camera & Darkroom 1999 #4 to the extent that I too found that it is not really
"cool" at all. It really seems to be decided neutral black, at least when
developed in Agfa Neutol.

The feature of the paper that struck Barry was the brightness of its base.
On side-by-side comparison, I found it to be very similar to Agfa Polycontrast
Premium RC. Interestingly, the back surface of the Agfa paper was vary
noticeably brighter than the Ilford. I wonder if Ilford has toned it down since
the pre-production (I presume) batch that Barry tested.

The Cooltone paper does not have the rather mushy mid tones that I associate
with, and dislike about, Ilford Multigrade IV. However, the mid tones seem
somehow discontinuous and lacking the smooth variation of the Agfa paper. It is
a bit like the difference in the smoothness of gradation that one can often see
when comparing prints made from a 35mm and a medium-format negative.

I don't dislike the paper. I certainly prefer it to Multigrade IV, and it is
far more pleasing to my eye than similarly-priced competitors. It just does not
quite do what its name suggests that it will. After the highly distinctive
style of Warmtone (which I have only used in FB and not RC form), it comes as a
bit of a disappointment. At present, it seems to be about 30% cheaper that MG
IV or Agfa Polycontrast in the UK. I don't know if this situation will last, or
if it is a loss-leader on Ilford's part. If it does stay at this price, it
represents good value for money, and I can see myself using it quite a lot in
future for proofing and generally making prints where a snappy image is more
important than ultimate quality.

Unless I am missing the point entirely, what we seem to have on our hands is a
neutral-black paper with a rather snappy quality. In that respect, it does its
job. However, if you are looking for a genuine cool tone paper, I fear that
your search is not yet over. I would really like to be proven wrong.

Regards,
Alistair

Does anyone out there have and care to share any experience using Amidol
developer with Forte Variable contrast papers?

I am interested in whether this results in better low & mid tone separation
from contact printing as well as enlarging.

Hi folks

I'm fairly new to the pure-silver mailinglist, so I hope this is not
off-topic.

I have had my darkroom for almost a year now, and throughout this time I've
been using Ilford Multigrade IV RC Deluxe paper and Tetenal Variospeed W
paper developer.
I have two questions:
1. Would I get better/different results by using Ilfords own paper
developer?
2. Is there an optimal developing time? Tetenal says 50 secs, but others say
that you have to leave the paper in for up to 130 secs.

Thanks

FWIW:  The Forte papers are more or less designed for use with the Zonal-Pro
line of liquid developers.  Have you tried any of them?

I use the Zonal-Pro "Warmtone HQ" developer for all my printing at this
time, but switched due to problems I was having using dektol with the
warmtone Forte (Fortezo) papers.  It is a 100% hydroquinone (sp?) developer
and I love it.

Hope this helps.

Best - Jon

Hi,

If I could add how does this film compare to HP5 & TriX?

Thanks,

Hello listmembers:

I'm looking to standardize on my film, paper & chemicals. Right now I'm 
shooting TriX & HP5 in 120 & 135 format. I like both films, but have found 
HP5 lacking contrast in the 120 format? Not sure why, the 120 camera has a 
contrasty lens, should be similar to my 35mm lens?

For paper I was using Ilford's Multicontrast IV, but tried some of Agfa's 
Multicontrast Baryta paper & love it. Now I'm just trying to decide on which 
film to standardize on. For film dev,I'm using Ilfotec HC, for paper dev I'm 
using Ilfords Universal dev. 

Just wondering would I get better results witha diff film dev? What about 
Agfa's Paper dev (Neutol WA)? Is it worth a try?

Thanks & happy new year to all

Frederic

Questions of film, chemicals and paper preferences, IMHO, are too subjective
to be debated.

As to the lower contrast 120 rollfilm vs 35mm you are experiencing, try
increasing your rollfilm agitation by 50 percent over your 35mm film
agitation.  Tank inversions slosh more fresh developer over 35mm film than
over rollfilm because of 35mm film's  narrower width and sprocket holes.

Cheers,

John R

Hi John:

You are probably right. Thanks for the tip on processing the 120 vs 35mm

Hello !
On my opinion, you do not have to buy the same brand as the paper.
I think that something "standard" like Ilford PQ or Agfa Neutol will do.
The main thing to know is how long you will let the paper develop ?
Well it depend on the paper (more for a FB than for a RC) and the dev.
used. A good star will be to check the literature of the dev, and paper
and chose the longest of the two. This will ensure that you can reach
maximum black if need be. (of course, you then must respect this time
for every sheet of paper, event if you change exposure or contrast grade
to get consistent results.)
Next you must ensure that your dev is not exhausted. Check the quantity
os, say 8x10 sheet it can handle for a liter and stay on the safe side
if you want consistent results.

After a while you will experiment with different dev. to achieve warmer
image and/or smooth gradation control. 
Hope this helps !

Hello !
On my opinion, you do not have to buy the same brand as the paper.
I think that something "standard" like Ilford PQ or Agfa Neutol will do.
The main thing to know is how long you will let the paper develop ?
Well it depend on the paper (more for a FB than for a RC) and the dev.
used. A good star will be to check the literature of the dev, and paper
and chose the longest of the two. This will ensure that you can reach
maximum black if need be. (of course, you then must respect this time
for every sheet of paper, event if you change exposure or contrast grade
to get consistent results.)
Next you must ensure that your dev is not exhausted. Check the quantity
os, say 8x10 sheet it can handle for a liter and stay on the safe side
if you want consistent results.

After a while you will experiment with different dev. to achieve warmer
image and/or smooth gradation control. 
Hope this helps !

I get stunning results with HP5+ in PMK.  If your contrast is wrong, it's
probably the developer, exposure or development time that is at fault.  In
PMK, I rate the film at 320 and develop 11 min at 70 degrees in PMK.  PMK is
an incredible developer and works particularly well with HP5+.

Curt

Hello !
Since some years, now, I use APX 100 and 400 in 35 mm and 120 (a few) I
have difficulties comparing it with FP4/HP5 as I do not use them. But
these are two films I like because they offer me a good quality neg. at
really low price (they are a way cheaper than anything else in my town) 
I use Xtol 1+2 and Rodinal (mostly 1+50) and sometimes Neofin blue for
the 100 APX film. Xtol is IHMO the best dev. for these films.  So why do
not give them a try ? I think this will be better than asking ? What do
you think ?
And happy new year !

Hi Curt,

You're on this list too! I just signed on after a RUG recommended it to 
improve one's technique in the darkroom.

Thanks for the info on PMK dev. I hope it comes in liquid form though. My 
space is limited for storage at present.

Cheers,

Frederic

Hi Frederick:  I suggest that you try Oriental Seagull (Freestyle Sales, LAX)
developed in Dektol 1: 2 (Dektol:Water) for at least two minutes.  With Tri-X
this works very well for just about everything.  It even takes toning very
well.  Bill Carson

Recently tried some in xtol 1:2...nice tonality.  To me grainier than
trix but OK for 8x10s.  Generally cheaper than trix in my area(Portland,
OR) but I still prefer HP5+.  Have used in Rodinal 1:50 and 1:100, but
again prefer HP5 in Edwal FG7s..your mileage may vary.  Imho apx400
while it has a wonderful tonality, is inherently grainier than HP5+ or
TriX

> PMK really does work well with HP5+ & Tri-X. As a recent convert to PMK I
do find it seems to be an answer to all problems dev. wise. Well worth a
try. I use in the 2 liqiud form as Gordon Hutchings book & find it is also
very stable with no deterioration, (until mixed). But I do have
reservations. I do use multigrade paper 99% of the time. For R/film I have
an enlarger where I can use normal M/grade filters, & have no problem with
contrast grades. For 35mm I have a leitz V35 enlarger (which I love) but it
has a multigrade head. If I use any 35mm film in this enlarger that has been
dev;d in PMK I have lots of problems with contrast. With no filtration the
m/grade paper prints OK. If I try to add contrast the print seems to go
softer, up to grade 41/2. From 41/2 to 5 there is then a massive increase in
contrast. A friend has printed the same negs on an enlarger with normal
filters & got perfect results, & steps in grades. I assume that there is
some sort of built in ND filter that works against the staining. I have
approached Leitz, Ilford & Kodak, but none have being able to come up with
an explanation. I have now stopped using PMK with 35mm, but that is not what
I wanted. Is there anyone who has come across a similar problem, & may have
an answer?. Or anyone with a scientific background that could give an
explanation? I would like to be able to carry on using PMK as a standard
dev. for all films, not just roll film. HELP!

Bo, I'm afraid that my experience of Multigrade 4 RC is not good and I 
abandoned it's usage some while back as I found it handled highlights poorly 
by comparison with Agfa's Multicontrast Premium.  I develop in Ilfords 
standard multigrade dev.  Ilfords Multigrade fibre paper however does seem to 
be very much better than the resin coated!

Howard,

Where do you get your PMK in liquid form?  I can't seem to find it.

This is not a Pyro problem, if your friend can print them with filters on 
a different enlarger.  Sounds like the filters in your enlarger are faded 
or are malfunctioning mechanically( slipping or binding when they should 
be sliding into the light path). I'd open up the head and check them out- 
the gels can be replaced if faded or freed up if sticking . I know they 
claim to be fade proof- but they are not.

Many thanks for your prompt reply. I follow your thinking on this but with a
normal dev,d neg I have no problems. I think the problem comes from the
M/grade head. I presume there is some sort of built in neutral density
filter in the M/grade module that that keeps the times constant when
changing grades. Because the paper grade is governed by the colouration of
the light I think (& this may not make sense) that the actual pyro stain
somehow reacts with the colour of the light to produce a light that causes
the M/grade paper to reduce contrast. I do not think for 1 moment that the
negs are any way responsible, they work completely normal on another
enlarger with separate filters. Somehow it appears that it is the M/grade
head that is causing the problem, & there may not be a solution. So I have
gone back to souping 35mm in Rodinal or a 2 bath & those negs work perfectly
with the M/grade head, giving constant grade changes. I keep the PMK pyro
for 120 work. Any help would be appreciated.

I have used it and found it to be much warmer than the normal Ilford
M/grade. I thought it was me, I am quite pleased I am not alone. Pleasing
and different, but certainly not cooltone.

Those of you who like the results from HP5+ and PMK may wish to try this
film in Barry Thornton's DiXactol developer. It's a Catechol based tanning
developer which can be used as a two bath or one shot single bath.
This combination gives beautifully separated highlight and shadow tones with
fixed (graded) and variable contrast papers.The stain with this developer is a
brownish red colour, and unlike PMK's yellow/green stain contributes to
printing density with VC paper without reducing highlight contrast too much.
Highlights resist blocking up and can be easily burnt in. (Probably this is
due to the very strong tanning action in the highlights which prevents
diffusion of developer into the emulsion rather than the stain acting
as a VC paper contrast reducing mask).

If you treat an FP5+ negative in a blix bath to remove the silver and measure
the density of the stain you find it contributes 50% to a total highlight
density of 1.1 units (blue light). The stain image is almost grainless and
appears to "fill in" between the silver grains giving a finer grained print
than you would expect for the film speed. Also since half the image density
is stain the amount of development needed is less than that for a pure silver
image, again reducing grain.

So far I've tried DiXactol with HP5+, APX100 and Delta 100. I like the
results very much.

Alistair, I'm not too sure that you will be proved wrong!  I too think that 
cooltone is not a good description but other than warmtone fibre it's the 1st 
Ilford paper I have used and liked in years!  So far I have found it 
certainly preferable to multigrade 4.  Cooltone also seemed to handle 
highlights well (with my principle combination of Rodinal and APX25/120)  But 
so far I still prefer the Agfa product for RC prints.  BTW my paper dev was 
Ilford multigrade.

I missed something here.  What is Ilford Cooltone?  Has this anything to do
with the yet unannounced cold tone paper they are working on?

Ilford Cooltone was field tested during most of 1999 by several printers in
the UK and mainland Europe. It was announced last Fall and available
through UK (and presumably European) dealers from around the beginning of
December 1999.

I published a very full review of the new paper written by Barry Thornton
(one of the "field" testers) and have myself already used 600 sheets of the
material. Although I use a Durst 1200 fitted with a Multigraph head which
has a channel for MG IV I have to say that I really struggled with the
original Ilford Multigrade IV... similarly when Ilford Warmtone was
announced, I tried it and wasn't impressed. When a PR sample packet of 25
sheets of Cooltone (Ilford ain't generous nowadays <s>) arrived late last
year I almost tossed it in the bin. However, it worked like magic using the
same Multigraph channel as MG IV... and I was hooked. I've used 600 sheets
of 8x10 already partly because it has been on an introductory "half-price"
offer from selected UK dealers... and *I LIKE IT*.

Incidentally, looking at stand-alone prints Cooltone does not look
particularly cold... simply neutral... but viewed next to Agfa's MCC,
Cooltone does look cool. The development time has to be extended
considerably from the 45/60 seconds you might be used to with regular RC
paper... to more like 3 minutes, so the rapid dev time hardly shouts as an
"RC advantage" any more!

And talking of speed... this paper is *fast*... printing 5x7 images on 8x10
paper with the Multigraph (and using the 6x7 rather than the 35mm mixing
box to cut the light a touch from the 250w source) my average exposure
times were arouind 0.7 secs (that's right, nought-point-seven-seconds)...
so work with negs that don't require and dodging or burning <g>.

Those of you who like the results from HP5+ and PMK may wish to try this
film in Barry Thornton's DiXactol developer. It's a Catechol based tanning
developer which can be used as a two bath or one shot single bath.
This combination gives beautifully separated highlight and shadow tones
with
fixed (graded) and variable contrast papers.The stain with this developer
is a
brownish red colour, and unlike PMK's yellow/green stain contributes to
printing density with VC paper without reducing highlight contrast too
much.
Highlights resist blocking up and can be easily burnt in. (Probably this is
due to the very strong tanning action in the highlights which prevents
diffusion of developer into the emulsion rather than the stain acting
as a VC paper contrast reducing mask).

If you treat an FP5+ negative in a blix bath to remove the silver and
measure
the density of the stain you find it contributes 50% to a total highlight
density of 1.1 units (blue light). The stain image is almost grainless and
appears to "fill in" between the silver grains giving a finer grained print
than you would expect for the film speed. Also since half the image density
is stain the amount of development needed is less than that for a pure
silver
image, again reducing grain.

So far I've tried DiXactol with HP5+, APX100 and Delta 100. I like the
results very much.

Hi,

Has any one tried DiXactol with Tmax 400.  This developer sounds
interesting and was wondering about its combo with this film.

TIA, Gary

Thanks for the update.  It is not yet available in North America.  I
checked on Ilford's website today, and found nothing there as well.

If Ilford Imaging decide not to market Cooltone in North America in the
near future, or decide not to manufacture the paper as a fibre alternative
for "fine-printers", then IMHO they will be making two big mistakes.

BTW: I don't have any information on any or what levels of "whiteners" that
may have been added to the new Cooltone, but the whiteness of the paper
base is much brighter when batch scanned with Ilford's ordinary MG RC IV
and Warmtone RC products.

I finally got a chance to see the Carleton Watkins exhibit "The Art of
Perception" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (in NYC).  Unfortunately
this exhibit closes this weekend.  If you're in the NYC area I would
strongly recommend that you try and see this exhibit this weekend.

This is an incredible exhibit.  Most of the prints are albumen silver
prints from 18x22 inch glass negatives.  A few of them show signs of
deterioration (yellowing, usually along the left edge).  The prints
are really beautiful.  Unlike the Shackleton/Hurley exhibit at the
American Museum of Natural History last summer, there was plenty of
room to stand back and enjoy the entire picture, including several
panoramic series of large prints.  Although there were quite a few
people there, the exhibit hall did not seem crowded.  It's possible
that many people were at this exhibit because (like my wife and I)
they spotted it while on the way to the Egyptian art exhibit down the
hall that also closes this weekend (and was very crowded).

The exhibit covers Watkins' trips to Yosemite in the 1860's, the
Columbia River in Oregon, and various scenes in and around San
Francisco.  The accompanying placards do a good job of explaining both
the scene depicted and what had to be done to take the image (e.g.,
packing a portable darkroom and 18x22 camera and supplies all around
the rim of Yosemite valley before the modern trails existed).

Unfortunately the placards were not completely free of modern
political sentiments.  One of the placards practically forgave Watkins
for taking beautiful pictures of industrial scenes (various mining and
railroad scenes) because the sensibilities of the times wouldn't have
made it seem wrong.  I wonder what the curator thinks of John Sexton's
"Places of Power" series.

In addition to the large prints several cabinet style stereoscopes
(for viewing a sequence of stereocards) were on display.  Unlike many
museum stereo card displays I've seen, the acrylic display cabinets
protecting the cabinet viewers and stereocards have cut outs that
allow the viewer lenses to protrude far enough so that you can view
the stereo card on display.  Only one of the cabinets on display had
two cuts outs so that you could view back to back facing cards.  None
of the cabinets allowed you to change cards.  The quality of the views
wasn't the greatest, but I may be biased by my experience with modern
stereoviews and viewers.

The last room of the exhibit had several computers with shutter
glasses set up so that you could view more of the stereocards.  I
didn't get a chance to look at this but my wife thought it was very
well done.  She mentioned that the images were all arranged so that
the scene appears in front of screen.  This was probably done by the
exhibit curators to enhance the stereoscopic (3D) effect, because none
of the actually stereocards on display violated the stereo window in
this manner.  My wife, who is generally not a photography enthusiast
(particularly not a B&W enthusiast), was very impressed with Watkins'
use of composition to make the most of the stereoscopic depth of the
scenes shown.

For anyone interested in seeing this exhibit I just found out that it
will be shown at the J Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles from February
15-June 4, 2000.

Bob,
   Thanks for the report on DiXactol. I had asked about it here several
weeks ago, but it seemed that very few, if any, of us here in the US had
used it yet. I first heard about it from the Photographer's Formulary web
site. I get the impression that you like DiXactol as much as PMK. Am I
correct in this assumption? Are there any particular subjects that you find
to be particularly good candidates for this developer (backlit landscapes
with clouds, ocean waves, etc.)?
 Thanks again...   Kevin Dickerson

Harry, Greetings!  Though I have been using Nova for over 10 years to 
exclusively process B&W RC and Fibre I have only seen the transparent fronted 
(I think that this is the one you mean) unit at a show and yes it certainly 
looks as if it could be an improvement on my standard 4 slot unit but not 
sufficient to make me buy it!  On the whole though I am very pleased with the 
performance of all my ( I have a 13 slot washer as well) Nova kit, that is as 
long as you can live with the "Dracula" bites on the edge of the print.

Cheers

Marten

Hi

We have a 4 slot Nova system as well.  We have been using it for about
about two years and bought it before the new one with the transparent
front was introduced.  The original Nova tank works great for us as it
saves a huge amount of space and time, not to mention being
environmentally friendly due to saving on chemicals.  Would not be
without it.  The 'Dracula' bights are very small and in any event we
trim anything critical.

Regards
Sylvia and Malcolm

Has anyone tried this paper devloper from Freestyle?  The write-up on
the web site tries to make it sound like it may be a Kodak product.

Does anyone know  technical details about this. The name sounds like a take
off on Xtol and thus I was wondering if this is a pyrocatechin - Vitamin C
mix? Sort of like a "Rollo pyrocatechin"?

Hi Robbie:  I don't think that it is a Kodak product but I could accept
that it is something of an equivalent formulae.  It should, if true,
perform about the same as the Kodak product.  Regards,  Bill

I've been using the Nova slot processors for years, too, and they've made
life much simpler in the darkroom.  I often squeeze a little printing time
in between other work and family responsibilities; when I had to mix (and
dump) new chemistry for each session, I always felt I had to devote many
hours to justify it...hence, did much less printing.  I have one of the
units with a thermostat...those new clear-sided ones have none which is
something of a disadvantage in winter when the chemicals can get pretty
chilly. Though they seem nice for some of the developing-by-inspection
processes I'd like to try, like lith printing. 

When using the Nova for fiber, as opposed to RC printing, I've found it
useful to have a unit one size bigger than the paper since it gets kind of
"floppy".

I'm a new subscriber to this list and am a fine art photographer in
Philadelphia.  Am really enjoying the dialogue so far.

Regards,

Rita Bernstein

    I often find myself in a similar situation and have been considering the
NOVA for that exact reason.  My main concern is how long one can expect mixed
chemicals to last in the NOVA and still achieve consistent results.  Can
anyone shed some light on how long mixed chemicals should be left before
replacement?

Jamie and everyone:

You'll find that the paper (especially FB) absorbs lots of developer so I
tend to replenish that after every printing session or so.  I'm much less
vigilant about the stop bath and fixer and so far (fingers crossed) I've
had no problems but I use my darkroom often enough that old chemistry is
never sitting around for more than a couple of weeks.  Jobo claims a month
or more is fine.

Rita

I'd be cautious of this.... There is not a lot of chemistry ( developer
especially) in these tanks.... Wouldn't exhaustion occur before oxidation
would get to the developer?  I usually make up 60-80 ounces of deceloper and
pitch it after about 30-40 11x14 prints.

The issue to me is of replenishment of the developer and fixer.,.....Stop is
so cheap that pitching it after every sessiojn is not a big issue,,,,

How many ounces or ml  do these hold?  8x10, 11x14, and 16x20 sizes.

How can you clean these?  do you use something special to wipe down the
interiors after draining and cleaning?

First I should say my comments refer to using DiXactol with
120 size film in 6x6cm format. I haven't tried it with 35mm
or 4x5 yet.

John Sarsgard asked:

> Bob, at what EI did you rate these films in dixactol?

The EIs I use are HP5+ 320, APX100 64, and Delta 100 64.
I find these give a Zone One density of 0.15 to 0.2 above
fb+f which is what I prefer rather than the 0.1 which is
often quoted. These are for single bath development.
These EIs are for my working conditions but could be used
as a starting point.

and Kevin Dickerson asked:

first part cut....
>I get the impression that you like DiXactol as much as PMK.
>Am I correct in this assumption? Are there any particular
>subjects that you find to be particularly good candidates
>for this developer (backlit landscapes with clouds, ocean
>waves, etc.)?

It's early days yet and I'm waiting for spring. My initial
feelings are that DiXactol gives brighter, more separated
highlight tones than PMK when used with VC papers. They can
still be burnt in and maintain tone separation. Subjects
handled well are sunlight on water, backlit clouds such
as sunsets and scenes with bright luminous clouds. However
I find normal contrast scenes are also reproduced with 
excellent tonality and acutance. I think DiXactol is sharper
than PMK .

I'm interested to see if there is sufficient compensation
for me to dispense with having to carry 2 film backs for N,
N-1 development etc.

and Jonathan Borden asked:

>Does anyone know  technical details about this. The name
>sounds like a take off on Xtol and thus I was wondering
>if this is a pyrocatechin - Vitamin C mix? Sort of like
>a "Rollo pyrocatechin"?

What I can learn from the data sheet packed with the
developer, the articles in Camera & Darkroom and AG+
is: the developer part A contains Pyrocatechol and a
critical amount of Glycin to give a speed increase,
there is no mention of ascorbate. Data sheet says part
B is a caustic solution, the C&D article says the activator
is unusual.
(Camera & Darkroom Issue 40 1999 #2, p-p 39-42, 
Processing/2)
(AG+ photographic Vol17, p-p 50 - 59, "Lost in the
long grass" Barry Thornton)

Using DIXactol I've observed a few things which may
be useful.

The first few rolls of film I developed showed very
slight uneven development along the edge which was
at the top of the tank. This was for both single and
two bath development. I think I've traced this to air
bubbles being trapped under the edge of the spiral
even though I tapped the tank after agitating and made
sure that there was at least 1cm of liquid above the
spiral. The solution was to add 2 drops of the non-
ionic surfactant Tween-20 to 500ml of developer.
Although the developer foams no bubbles stick under
the edge of the spiral and the development is even.
(Probably Ilfotol or Photoflo would work as well).

After drying some films appear to be slightly frosted
when viewed by transmitted or reflected light. (Maybe
micro-reticulation due to tanning?) APX100 and TMX
don't do it. With HP5+ it's in the emusion which
carries the image and with Pan F+ its the anti-curl
backing. It doesn't seem to be visible in the final
print though.

When scanning HP5+ negatives the image appears to be
very grainy but sharp and you have to use despeckle
in Photoshop to remove the grain. I didn't have this
when I developed HP5+ in Perceptol 1:2. So far I don't
know if this is due to the "frosting" or the grain
masking effect of the stain not registering with the
Nikon LS3500AF scanner.
                   -------------------------------------

I'd be interested in hearing other peoples 
experiences with DiXactol.

The 8x10's hold about a liter of chemistry and the 16x20's about two
liters.   Thirty to forty 11x14's sounds like ALOT before refreshing the
chemistry...and the developer will dip too low in the tank anyway long
before 30 prints.  In terms of pitching the stop bath, the issue for me is
less the cost than the hassle of measuring/mixing/filling new
chemistry...but you may have a better temperament!  I rarely clean my
Nova...only when I empty it completely to go away for a long vacation and
then I flush it a few times with fresh water.

HI

If I recall correctly (without looking at the instructions) Ilford
Multigrade developer is OK for 10 sheets of 8X10 and then it needs 100ml
drain and replenish.  That's equivelant to about 5 sheets of 11x14.  We
do the same for stop and fixer which amonst other things stops mildew
forming.   Again, capacity is on the fixer data sheets/Ilford bottle. 
As you mentioned, Rita, the developer does not usualy need to be drained
much, as it is carried over into the stop bath.  The chemicals easily
keep for a month.  We usually replenish ours every month but have
occasionally left it much longer with no ill effects.  To save time in a
print session, we preprepare small 150ml bottles of ready mixed
developer, etc.  It really is very convenient.

Regards
Sylvia

Does anyone use a plain water pre-soak with Nova Processors???

It should be pretty obvious I don;t own one of these ( yet )... your inputs
and comments are invaluable in making these kinds of decisions...

What is the price ( relative to the color type or absolute dollars ) of the
monochrome system?

There are two different lines of products here.  The Monochrome
Processors have been out for a while in the US.  They come in only
8x10 and 12x16 with 1 liter and 2 liter capacities.  See the Jobo
Products web page for a complete spec listing.

http://www.jobo-usa.com/jobofoto/products.htm

and look for Nova Processors.  Its basically a tri-mate i.e. 3 slots
but without heaters.

Then there is the newest product line -- the Nova FB.  Some info is
available at:    http://www.novadarkroom.com/whatsnew.htm

I think its only available in 8x10 and 12x16, has a clear front so you
can see the picture develop, and has special new holders for fiber paper.

For 16x20 paper you'll still have to use the original processors -- the
trimate or quad.  Has anyone done 16x20 fiber paper in these processors?
I'd suspect you might need to use two clips or maybe you fingers too.

Jamie I have "stored" chemistry in my Nova (4 slot 16" x 12") for upto 4 
weeks without any noticeable defect.  When using I always drain out half the 
tank on each of the slots and replenish, that way I am always able to snatch 
a few minutes to make a print as all the chemistry is up to temperature (I 
never switch the heater off!).

Cheers

Hi Jamie,

I've used a 16 x12 Nova Quad for over 4 years and the chemistry lasts and
lasts and lasts... If you use something like "Ethol LPD" (Lasting Paper
Developr) which is readily available on your side of the pond the developer
will stay fresh even longer... say three months! And, with LPD in a
slot-processor you can even develop sheet films such as HP5+ (at EI 2000)
and get interesting results.

A case history: In December I processed 600 (six hundred) 8 x 10 sheets of
the new Ilford Cooltone in the *SAME* 2 litres of dev, stop and fix - not to
see if it could be done, but because I was in a disorganised rush - by
simply replenishing the levels of the three baths at the end of each
session. The dev level drops because of the take-up of liquid by each "dry"
print, but the stop and fix levels remain fairly constant because it is a
"wet" print entering the latter slots each time... so I drained off about
half a litre (1/4 the volume of the slot) of stop and fix every 150 prints,
or so, and so part-replenished with fresh mix. Martin Collins (another
pure-silverer) will attest to the consistency of the prints if you ask
him... he visited me last week and saw the results.

Incidentally, I *hate* the "Dracula's teeth marks left on prints by the
(admittedly clever) Nova Clips... so I simply use regular (Paterson) plastic
print tongs, OK, you have to "pinch" the tongs throughout the process in
order to hold the print... but it keeps your wrist strong! 

There's also doubt in some people's minds about processing fibre prints in a
slot processor... OK, fibre becomes floppy after a minte or so, but Nova
have a new fibre print holder (hopefully *no* teeth) which allieviates the
problem. I haven't tried it yet, but I think Tim Rudman (another
pure-silverer) has in field trial testing.

BTW: I'm still trying to catch up on 100's of e-mails and will contact you
privately on other matters  8-)

Cheers,

I saw the clear fronted slot processor at the Photo Expo show in NYC in
October.  The Jobo people told me it wasn't likely to be available in the
US for at least a few months.  Be aware that "clear" isn't very....it's a
stippled type surface that wouldn't be that easy to see through in MY
darkroom!

Interesting.  I would like some type of Nova processor as my darkroom is in
2nd bathroom in the house and I don't have a lot of room to spare.  Also
they seem less messy and less smell, esp. with the fixer.  They do seem a
little expensive for what amounts to vertical trays (tanks).  Still, I like
the idea.

Hi Robbie,

I used the Jobo DuoLab for a year (I bought one... it wasn't a trade demo
product given for evaluation in the magazine <s>) and liked it very much.
However, the decision to buy a DuoLab depends on your throughput of film and
paper. And although I only used one for B&W and E-^ film processing and B&W
printing it would be a very neat unit for RA-4 colour.

For a start the DouLab's film processing mode will only accept two films...
from memory you can only mount a 2-film tank set up on it (and the Jobo tank
requires a dedicated lid with a special cog on it) but if you can afix a
larger film tank you are still limited by the supplied chemical bottles
which only hold 300ml(?) of liquids. The processing steps are quite easy to
undertake... you leave all the tops off the bottles (they're heating up in
the built-in water bath) and screw (yes, screw) the inverted film tank onto
the 1st dev bottle. Then invert the two so that the developer flows into the
film tank... put the tank on the roller/cog base and the whole lot merrily
turns for the allotted time. Then grasp the tank/bottle and invert to pour
the juice back into the storage bottle, set the bottle base into the lugs in
the water bath, unscrew the tank... screw the tank into the next process
bottle... invert again to flow the juice into the tank... and so on.
Basically I found using the DuoLab a very efficient and clean way of
processing two films at a time... better in a way than my Jobo CPE-2 + Lift
processsor which is so much larger on the bench.

Paper processing was also efficient but limited by the size of the 30 degree
angled slots. It handles 8 x 10 with ease but, from memory, nothing bigger.
Also the strange "paddle-cum-sucker" print handler was next to useless... it
was inconsistent in its adhering abilities, and more fiddly to rinse after
being in the fix for the next developing run... so I used regular Paterson
print tongs (as in my Nova Quad).

One aspect of the DuoLab is novel... the coil water heater, which uses a
small amount of de-ionised water, brings the unit up to temperature in only
a few minutes.

If you only process a couple of films at a time, and limit yourself to
8x10s, and have space restrictions in your darkroom, then the DuoLab is a
fine and reliable unit (and a nice-to-look-at modern design as well)... and
fairly economically priced too (at least in the UK). My needs outstripped it
and I had to upgrade to a CPE-2 to process four films at a time (never do
colour prints) and a 16x12 Quad for mono prints. 

Hope that helps,

cheers,

from Russell Baston I tried DiXactol and thought it was a total disaster!
Had I received a poor batch? Tri X with PMK is superb, with DiXactol (two
bath) I got thin negs with grain like golf balls and terribly uneven
development. As single bath it is better but outrageously expensive and
still uneven and still nowhere near as good as PMK.

I've not tried PMK, but my experiment with DiXactol and Agfa APX100 (35mm)
was less than promising.  Soft, thin negs with more grain than Rodinal
1+50, my usual developer for this film.  On that basis I don't think it's
worth the hassle and expense but it would be unfair to dismiss it on one
result I guess.  Anyone else tried this combination?

Thanks to Ed Buziak of Camera + Darkroom for pointing me in the direction
of this mailing list, it's proving interesting reading thus far :-)

Best wishes
Richard

Thanks for everyone's responses about the NOVA processors.  I'm happy to hear
that the manufacturer's claims of chemical endurance in these units is fairly
realistic and that people are pleased with the performance.  It really seems
like a good route for me to take as well.  I was considering waiting for the
FB model to hit the market, but as I only print 8x10, and use thick papers
such as Forte, I should not need to worry about moving the wet paper from slot
to slot (correct me if my impression is wrong).  Also, I predict a
considerable price difference between the present print clip and the FB's
print frame.

Question: on the 8x10 model, how far from the paper edge do the "vampire"
marks go?

Thanks,
Jamie.

Can anyone explain the purpose of the "clear" Nova processor? I used 
mine in total darkness.

Sometimes one wants to develop by (safe light) inspection, especially with
processes like lith printing.

Rita, thanks for the reply. However, since you lift the sheet out why 
can't that be the occasion for inspection?

Finally got my e-mail back after Virgins e-shut down. Quite a lot of
questions about the Nova FB. A few points to pick up:

The clear front is plain, transparent and crystal clear perspex. It is not
textured like earlier models.
It is angled backwards to allow dev by inspection (B&W)

The paper is held easily and flat in the new FB holders (and no 'dracula
teeth')
I doubt it is in the US yet - they recently asked for the one I was testing
as they needed to photograph it for the catalogue as it was the only one in
existence. I'm sure production has started now but it is very new
It does have a thermostatic heat control
It has 4 slots
It is a huge improvement on the previous designs IMHO and well worth a good
look.

With Lith printing you want to keep the print in the dev until it approaches
'snatch point', so you need to be able to see when it approaches. It takes a
long time to get there, and then progresses very fast.

It's currently POA only - they tell me they have not decided whether to mass
produce 20x16 yet

I picked up some which I am about to try.  Given the results you have had,
would I be better off trying it as a one or two bath developer?

hello list members:

I'm thinking about getting an archival print washer. I'd like to get 
recommendations on a good unit. They all seem about the same price, e.i. 
expensive! 
Any good options out there for an inexpensive unit? 

Thanks!

Frederic

They are pretty much the same, depending on who's propoganda you listen to.
I happen to own 2 Zone VI's (1  16x20 and 1  20x24) mostly because I bought
into Fred Pickers theory that fix is heavier than water so his design has a
system for that.  I personally don't like the ones with bubbles in the wash
as I have seen them stick to the print and I don't think it gets a proper
wash.  however, this is just my opinion.  If you want a cheap way out, just
remember, that just 5 min. pre-wash followed by Perma wash, with a final 5
minute wahsh is the ANSI standard for archivl washing.  A lot has to do
with how many prints you are doing and your habits...you could set up 2
trays with the Kodak siphon and run 1 print in the first wash as you are
processing the second, then just move them along as you go thru the
subsiquent baths and not need the expensive washers.  For me, i print large
amounts therefore I need a washer to batch wash them.

hope this helps.

Fredrick,
I bought a 16 x 20 from Versalab about six months ago and have been very
happy with it.  I paid about $290 for it.  They are in Loveland, CO and the
phone is 970-622-0240.  Nice people to deal with.

I think the most incredible unit I have ever seen is made by a small shop
named "Red Village Photo Products."  They do have a web page.  While I own a
Zone VI print washer which I've had for years, I'd gladly trade for this
one.  It has an open design so water can flow arond the entire print while
no one side becomes "glued" to one of the walls, impeding the wash.  These
washers also cost about 2/3 of the others.  I do own one of their 4x5 film
washers and it's great.  Call Alex up and tell him I recommended you.  He's
a real clever guy and we've had some very worthwhile dialogues.  And, if you
buy a 16x20 one and don't like it, I'll swap you my Zone VI even up!

Curt

ps - I have no connection with them other than as a satisfied owner of one
of their products.

Bill:

With, for example, lith printing, there's a critical "snatch" point and
very little window for delay so you need to watch the development
constantly not just periodically as permitted by lifting the print out of
the slot.

Rita

Hi Tim,

I thought of one more question.  With the new holders, is there a frame for
the whole sheet of paper?  The main concern I have is using different size
papers with it.  If I got a 12x16 unit can I easily use 8x10 and 11x14
paper in it?  We don't have 12x16 paper here in the US.

I've got literature from most all the major film makers going back many
decades before anyone ever heard of Fred Picker saying pretty much the
same thing, so it's giving him too much credit to call it his

Yes, it is an old wive tale. Sit a jar of fixer on a shelf & dilute it any
way you want & watch all you want & you won't see fixer settling to the
bottom. It doesn't come out of solution, it mixes well & stays in the mix
quite nicely.

please send these photos!!!  I use some plastic coated letter holders used to

Hello !
I'm too interrested in such an archival washer, as my actual setup
doesn't satisfy me too much.
So if you have a PDF or Postscript file ready, it will be fine to be
posted here I hope ?
Best regards

A good point & one I had meant to mention in my reply.
The holders I tested were for 16x12.and there were 2 or 3 slightly different
designs. It has a small perforated cradle along the base and two small cut
out flaps at the top which could hold the top edge. I found it could take
any size smaller than 16x12 but there was a tendency for the smaller sizes
to float out of the cradle if they were not restrained at the top. It was a
minor problem with most papers but 'art' papers like Luminos Tapestry float
to the top (also in slot washers) and I suggested that the holder could very
easily be made 'universal' by cutting slots at the appropriate positions.
Nova agreed with this, but I have no info as to whether it has been done.
The design lends itself to this easily though.

Don't wash too long, you may wash out the brighteners if present. The hypo
clearing regime is better - and of course fresh or 2 bath fixer

We have been talking about Nova processors - They also make a variety of
washers, check them out. I have several and they have given me many years of

My Nova washer, a 13 slot 12" x 16", has been in use for over 10 years for 
both fibre and RC.  It works well and I have no complaints at all!  I like 
kit like that!

I have a Versalab...it's not particularly elegant looking, but has good
capacity and is not as expensive as many.  I think the 11x14 is about $199.
It siphons the waste water from the bottom.  My residual hypo tests show
that it is quite effective.  Ads for this in most every PhotoTechniques,
and other magazines.  If you can't find them, I can dig it up.  John

hello list members:

I'm thinking about getting an archival print washer. I'd like to get
recommendations on a good unit. They all seem about the same price, e.i.
expensive!
Any good options out there for an inexpensive unit?

Thanks!

Considering , that there is considerable confusion today as to "what
constitutes" and "how to achieve" archival results in printing- the
discussion of what washer is the best is academic. "Flushing" from the
top or the bottom is less important than are frequent changes of and
free flow of clean water around the surfaces. Personally, until there is
some consensus and agreement, I'm archival processing my negatives- to
hedge my bet.

>> It doesn't come out of solution, it mixes well & stays in the mix
quite nicely. <<

Speaking from having mixed several formulas and several different
manufactured liquids since 1963-- I can definitely say that it "T'aint
Necessarily So"!
Improper mixing, improper storage, and unanticipated temperature
fluctuations, all can cause fixers to not desolve and/or come out of
solution and/or crystallize.


your fighting the good fight and loosing to time,

Thanks, Tillman:  Your elaborate tests add another point to the "heavier
than water" debate and that's the fact that used fixer contains more
than just the original fixer chemicals--it's loaded with silver!!

Interesting, Tillman.  I use the Ilford method as well, but they do not
recommend 2 fixing baths, only one.  From their FAQ on the subject:

6.What is the ILFORD Archival Sequence?
           The ILFORD Archival Sequence is a method of processing fiber base papers
           for maximum longevity while reducing the amount of water and time used. The
           method, which was fully tested more than a decade ago, requires the use of a
           non-hardening rapid fixer mixed at film strength. After the paper has been
           developed and stopped, it is placed in such a fixer for 60 seconds with
           intermittent agitation. Next the paper is placed in a running wash for five minutes,
           followed by an immersion in ILFORD Wash Aid (1+4) for ten minutes with
           intermittent agitation. The end of the sequence requires an additional five minute
           running wash. 


I follow this approach roughly:

1) Fix one minute in Ilford Multi-Grade Fixer (non hardening).  I don't need two fix baths
   because I keep track of the number of 8x10 equivalents I put through the fix.  At
   100-125 (Ilford says it is good for 150+) I mix up a new batch.

2) 5 minute rinse in running water - in my case, it is the overflow from my print washer.

3) Minimum of 5 minutes in PeraWash (3oz/gal) combined with Selenium Toner (1:30) - may
   be more as toning requires.

4) Final wash in Oriental Eco-Washer for one hour at 36oz/min flow rate.  I like this washer
   because it works quite nicely with this very low water flow rate.

5) Air dry on screens *face-up* to prevent contamination of print surface by residues on screen.

6) Flatten in dry mount press

7) Mount

8) Try to sell the print, fail, go broke, keep doing it because I love it...

HT-1 tests confirm this to be a consistently excellent process - stain is essentially invisible
after this sequence.

 Just to clarify....what you are saying here, is that if you wash prints 
individually they will be ok e.i. archival?

dear pure silver group,

Several years ago I spent several weeks testing different archival washers
looking for a good design. One idea I worked with was he old idea that
fixer was heaver than water and would settle to the bottom. To make a very
long story short I did several printng test to check on how much fixeer was
absorbed by the paper and how quickly it washed out.

A few conclusions:

1. paper absorbed less fixer if it was fresh. There is a very complex
chemical reaction that is taking place beyond the mere "fixing" of the
print. During the process complex chemicals are created that are actually
reabsorbed back into the paper and are very difficult to wash out. So I
always use a two bath fixer replacing the first fix every printing session
and moving the second fix to the fifst bath. This occurs way before the
exhaustion rate is reached.

2. I found by si;ver nitrate testing that washing one print with a Kodak
tray siphon the quickest method. Using a double fix and film strength for a
short fixing tikme in each then a 15 minute wash with a Kodak tray siphon
washed complete ly clean according the the stain test and a selenium test.

3. I also let a full set of prints (15 I think) fill and archival washer
and washed for an hour, testing all four edges with silver nitrate every 5
minutes. with double fix and fixer remover they washe clean on all four
edges in about 30 minutes, if the fix was fresh.

4. i also let a full set of prints sit in od fixer but not exhausted fixer,
as letting them sit during a printing cycle rather than them sitting in
water and repeating the above test. After an hour they still did not test
clean and stained with selenium.

5. I did another batch through fresh fixer and fersh fixer remover, placed
them in a verticla print washer and let them sit over night with no water
running through the washer. I then testes all foru edges of each print. The
op edges tested rather clean and the bottom was filled with fixer. I then
filpped the print around, top on bottom, drained a few inches of water and
washed them. After ten minutes all four edges were fairly clean and after
20 minutes they tested completely clean, both with silver nitrate and
selenium.

We were trying to find out a way to save water, adn the over night soak in
a vertical print washer , then drainingg a few inches of 'heavy" water then
washing for 20 minutes worked great.

I think the real issues arethe freshness of your fixer. i like the Ilford
method of strong fixer for a short period of time (two fixing baths with
rapid fixer at film strength, a rinse, then into a fixer remover or hypo
clear then into a holding bath and finally a half hour to an hour wash.

Do the brightening agents wash out, to warying degrees yes with extended
wash. On a paper like Ilford multigrade warm tone it actually makes it
slightly warmer because the base becomes slightly creamier (htere are not
many brightners in that paper). seagul and old Zone Vi lost a lot of
brightners. New multigrade doesn't seem to lose as much. Pick your posion.

But for me the question really is the freshness of the fixer. Don't
replenish fixer and  when ni doubt about its freshness dump it.

I tnk any of the vertical print washer are fine, i have a gravity works
20x24, and a prototype made years ago similar to a Zone VI 11x14. It was
the 11x14 washer that I  extensively tested. Don't let the prints stick
together. Whne I wash more than one print to a slot I wash then face to
face because its the back I am trying to get the fixer out of. It washes
fairly quickly of the emulsion ( when testing papers for archival quality
test the back as well as the front)


This sounds lie a lecture and I don't mean it to. You are all
photograp[hers an may already know this stuff but i had to put my 2 cents i
concerning fixer and these tests i did many years ago.

Sorry for taking so much time.

I thought after using Perma Wash...you only needed to rinse fiber paper an 
additional 5 minutes...why do it for an hour???  What is the eco-Washer 
like?, How do you mix the  Perma Wash AND the Toner together???  They mix?? I 
always used them separately!!!  Please let me know!!!!  Yipes...that would 
save a lot of work being able to mix Perma Wash and Toner together....though 
your wash for an hour is very time consuming....

A year or so ago, Photo Techniques published an in-depth article on the
mechanisms and fixing. Short version:

Once you rinse off the initial layer of fixer with running water, the real
issue is not having a continuous motion of water across the print.  The
actual mechanism is a leaching process wherein the argentosulphite
byproducts of fixing come out of the paper.  You can actually get
an archival print by rinsing thoroughly for a minute or so, and then
placing this 'rinsed' print in a tray of fresh water overnight... Well,
this might be a little overstated, you might have to change the water
once in the middle of the night.  The reason we use running water washes
is because is shortens the leaching time by keeping a clean layer of
water near the print.

A tray siphon system works fine as long as you do not put in 'diry'
prints with partially washed ones because then they all have to
go through a full wash cycle.  I used one of these for years with
a simple rule - wash for one hour after the last print is inserted
into the tray.  So long as you do not overload the wash tray and
the prints can float around comfortably, this works great.  BTW,
I would not use a normal tray for washing because it does not have
enough valume for large prints to move around in.  I went K-Mart
and got a big plastic storage bin, clamped the siphon to it and,
voila, instant (cheep) print washer.

The only reason I switched to a vertical washer was convenience -
you can add prints downstream without polluting the partially
washed ones in such a washer.  I did not buy one because it somehow
washes prints "better".

Yes a single print washed in  a kodak tray siphon washed prints extremely
well. When you ad more than one print the effiecency drops dramatically.

For the reason that 5 minutes is very optimistic. Test with the residual
hypo test kit & you might find the 5 minute time is a bit short.   Small
variations in water quality and temperature don't leave you enough of a
safety factor with such a short wash time.

Mixing the Perma Wash with the toner works but does run through a lot of
toner. The Perma Wash exhausts quickly & then has to be dumped-thus dumping
your toner each time. It may save time but uses the Selenium toner at a fast
rate.

One other item to consider in the wash equation is the quality of your rinse
water. Different areas of the country have water quality that varies a lot.
Some have high concentrations of organic matter, others a lot of iron &
minerals and still others water so hard you can hardly use it. These quality
issues have an effect on how quickly and completely the water will rinse
your prints.

The only way I have found that works for sure is to occasionally test the
results on prints to be sure my wash is working well. I use the fill & dump
method of soaking as our winter water temperature is in the high 30's at
times & running warm water costs a fortune. So I do the basic rinse of
sitting in the water during a print session, then a few soaks for about 5
minutes each, then 10 minutes in the Heico Perma Wash, then 8 changes of
water soak over a couple of hours. This gives prints that test cleaner than
what is considered the minimum for 'archival' results.

Exactly how I was going to respond.  The essence of the problem
is what "archival" really means in practice.  There is a lot of
underlying and complicated chemistry going on here, but in
actual practice, a good guide is to wash until you get almost
or no staining using an HT-1 stain test (available from the
Photographers Formulary).  In my tests, I have found that
even Oriental's recommendation of 40 minutes or so yields
more stain than I like to see - an hour is about right.
This, BTW, is consistent with other kinds of washing
approaches I have used over the years - it is not
the washing method  (as long as you have
reasonable water exchanges going on) but the leaching time
that really matters.

Not necessarily so.  A gallon of working strength Perma Wash is good for
100 8x10 equivalents, as I recall (that's 25 16x20s, my preferred printing
size). I usually mix half that amount per darkroom session because I cannot
make that many prints in an evening (which is when I typically work).  So,
I add 1.5 oz PW to 64oz water.  To make this a 1:30 toning solution as well,
I add roughly 2 1/4 oz Kodak Rapid Selenium Toner - hardly a huge amount
to dispose as a one-shot application.   I buy the toner in gallon sizes which
lasts me forever even when I am printing a lot...  This approach not only
saves time and, more importantly, space, it also makes the toning portion
of the process utterly repeatable. I can reprint a print I made five
years ago, follow my 'recipe' of notes on how to print, process, and tone
it, and get pretty much identical results every time.  

Oh yes, I always mix this concoction (and my developers and fixers) 
using distilled water - this eliminates the variability in your chemistry
that water introduces - despite what has been written elsewhere, water quality
can and will change reaction rates for things like developers (I have
proven this experimentally) and for toners (I assume, but have not
proven this).  Distilled water is pretty cheap and you have the
advantage of being able to process consistently anywhere you go.  This
is especially important if you want to process negatives while you
are at a location shooting (in theory - I've never actually needed to
do this).  If I could figure out how to do it economically and practically,
I'd *wash* the prints in distilled water to avoid the issues mentioned 
below, but (so far) I see no reasonable way to do this.

Earlier today, a pure-silver member queried me about my position on
sending attachments to the list.  Hence the following missive to all:

One suggestion here, folks, would be to limit attachments to those things
which absolutely cannot be sent any other way and need to go to the entire
group. Most mailing list managers reject such attachments out-of-hand,
but I do not, because there are times when only such an attachment will work.

However, in general, you should all try to avoid them for several important
reasons:

1) Not everyone uses the same tools - believe it or not, MS-Word is not the
   only popular text processing tool (Long Live TeX!) ;))  Such attachements
   are thus unreadable and useless to people in that situation.

2) MS-Office, similar applications, HTML w/embedded OLE automation, and
   HTML w/embedded JAVAScript have increasingly become
   vehicles for the propagation of viral infections.  You may unwittingly
   be propagating computer diseases in the attachment - not all viri 
   necessarily manifest themselves immediately.

3) Most/many people rely on relatively slow dial-up connections and downloading
   attachments takes substantially more time than reading the plain text -
   a binary attachment is typically twice as large as the equivalent plain
   text.

In general, I'd suggest the following rules of thumb be followed if at all possible:

1) Try to convey your pure-silver comments in plain text to the highest 
   degree possible.

2) If your communique' requires an attachment and only a select group of
   people need it, communicate with them off-list and send it independently.

3) If you believe your attachment is of wider interest, if possible,
   put it on a web site or ftp site, and publish its URL to the list
   instead.

4) As a court of last resort, publish the attachment here.

I would (very gently) suggest that the content of this attachment would be
just as effectively communicated in text (again no hostility intended,
just a bit of clarification...)

Well, I would like to respectfully disagree.

I am not a nut about these sorts of things, but I do use alot of selenium
and have therefore allowed my thoughts to evolve on its use.

Outside of dichromate's (which pure-silver users probably aren't concerned
with anyway), it is arguably the most toxic chemical in the darkroom - as
well as being one of the more ubiquitous.

It is a heavy metal and has remarkable longevity.  I mix up a gallon (using
8-10 oz of stock selenium) and tone dozens and dozens of 8x10's.  Once mixed
it lasts almost indefinitely.  I have come to believe it needs to be handled
with special consideration.  It does not leach easily from the body (if at
all), or out of the environment.

Emmet Gowin suggests soaking a couple of old work prints in an exhausted
solution overnight to help soak up the toxic selenium.  I don't know any
tests to confirm that this is effective, but I can see no harm in adopting
the procedure.

I make a special effort in my workshops to urge students *not* to mix up
selenium as a one-time toner to be tossed down the drain at the end of a
printing session.

Hope this is of some help.

Cheers -

I have adopted a different method for disposal, complements of Bruce
Barnbaum. I dump the old stuff I want to discard in a plastic bucket(in my
case a 1 & 1/2 gal plastic cat food container) and set it out & let the
water evaporate. I do this a number of times & then take the container to
our local hazardous waste guys to dispose of. Works fine.

With Perma Wash exhausting within a few hours I hate dumping Selenium that
lasts a lot longer with each print session, especially if I get interrupted
& lose a day or so printing & the chemistry has to go.

I have also found that mixing the selenium with Culligan water(or distilled)
gives me cleaner toning, or at least appears to. I live in an area with iron
in the water, high chlorine thanks to the city purification plant, sand &
grit in the lines(though I do filter it) and very hard water.

Every little big helps & the repeatability of consistent water is overlooked
too often.

I process with Xtol developer & after months of frustration & talks with EK
tech folks, I changed to the Culligan water and every inconsistency with
Xtol disappeared.

I also do my final rinse with both prints & negs in the clean water & it
does make a difference, especially in the photo-flo.

I wonder why you think this - could you expand?  Selenium is naturally
occuring and has been shown in some circumstances to be an anti-carcinogen.
I am not a chemist, but my reading on this subject leads me to suspect
that the toxicity of this substance has been vastly overstated in this
"Chemicals=Danger" mentality of contemporary society.  I am not saying you
are wrong, merely asking for the substantive, scientific support of the
levels of alleged toxicity.

I wonder if one of our resident chemists (hey Howard, are you listening???)
could jump in here and comment.  With equally due respect I would point out
that "I have come to believe..." is not a compelling argument which demonstrates
or proves the danger of this substance. I would encourage you to investigate
the breadth of sources available and determine for yourself just how much
toxic risk actually exists here, keeping in mind that we are not talking
about pure selenium but a rather dilute form of the substance.

For the record, if there is clear, supportable, scientific evidence that the
quantities of selenium used in the darkroom pose a serious environmental or
health risk, I will promptly cease mixing things the way I do.

Many substances have beneficial qualities in miniscule amounts - selenium
included.  FWIW - water is the source of all life, but ingest too much and
it will kill you.

What I offered in my earlier post was based on perhaps somewhat scattered
reading, extensive postings over the years from the "alt-photo-process"
list, as well as conversations with working photographers, Emmet Gowin
included.

If you're looking for documentation (and I do not criticize you in any way
for doing so) I might suggest you start by looking in the alt-photo-process
archive (it's searchable).  These practitioners handle toxic photographic
chemistry daily and have some interesting thoughts on the subject.

Outside of that, it would take me a certain amount of time to gather
together the various sources on which I have formed my opinion....

You are absolutely correct: we live in a paranoid society - and one that
wishes to make life risk free.  It's absurd in many cases what lengths
people will go to save each of us from ourselves.  Reading the government
hazard/safety reports (MSDS reports? - something like that) which accompany
most chemistry purchases would cause anyone to blanch and give up
photography.

As unsubstantiated and nebulous as it may seem, I'm simply trying to err on
the side of safe, conservative use of this chemical.

Cheers,

Jon Bailey

I am sure you have thought about it, but you could cut 16x20 paper down and
have a lot more choices. You will have a 20x8 inch piece left over.

The most common effects of lower toxic doses of Selenium are Fatigue GI
disturbance nail changes (where it is deposited) hair loss and more
seriously peripheral neuropathy.

This not anecdotal:

A metallic taste and a garlic like breath odour have been reported.
Problems have been reported even with the external use as a shampoo for
dandruff control.
Ransone J W et al Selenium Sulphide intoxication N Eng J Med 1961 264:
384-5

A further toxicity report is Renoe B W and D Rinehart Clin Chem News 6
No 7 10 July 1980

Merck Index Current 

Toxicity: At high doses (> 900 Åµg/day), selenium produces a toxic
syndrome consisting of dermatitis, loose hair, diseased nails, and
peripheral neuropathy associated with plasma levels > 100 Åµg/dL (> 12.7
Åµmol/L).

These signs and symptoms are reported as being rarely seen by most
sources.

As absorption can be through the skin a prudent course would be to
minimise exposure. All risk is relative and if you are aware and
sensible in handling you will be ok.

More speculatively research papers link the cancer effects (good) with
the toxicity (bad) which is not unusual. Happily any adverse effects
appear to resolve when exposure is reduced.

Best wishes

Hi Andrew:  That makes it a little bit different.  I estimate about 2.5 oz.
weight and that should cost me in US postage $2.20.  I you could just send me
two one pound notes I'll call it square and I'll spend them when next in jolly
old England.  My wife and I do a good bit of traveling and we always seem to
have some coins and frequently some paper left over so we have a system of
envelopes to store the stuff in and when next we travel to one of those
destinations, we have some instant coinage to use for taxi, telephone, tips,
etc. I do not know whether Rubbermaid products are produced or marketed in the
UK but the one I used is 22" X 16" X 6" deep and is clear polyethylene, I
believe.  They sell for about $4.00 here and I'm sure you have something
equivalent??  OK The one I made is illustrated and it works!  Regards,  Bill
Carson 862 Kalispell Drive, La Conner, Washington 98257-69623

Gee, I live on a small planet, and water is a scarce resource.  Couldn't
you shorten your wash time?

If you live on Planet Earth, water is not a scarce resource, it makes up
about 70% or so of the planet. Where do you live?

Why not use the water to rinse prints, that is a more noble pursuit than
watering those damn golf courses or leaching the acids at gold mine settling
ponds or bottling & selling small quantities for $3 a bottle.

Well guys, I live in the second driest state in the nation & we don't have a
scarcity of water here right now. Snow, yes. But water is doing just fine
where we are.

Now if all you city boys would quit driving cars & using gas that would help
us who live out where there are no busses, taxis or commuter trains.

    Has anyone found a good price for the Nova processors in North America?
I'm looking at the 8x10 Quad, and the only source I could find was $540US.

Thanks!

	It is important to differentiate types of toxicity. Many substances are
toxic in too high doses, Vitamins A & D for example. Many lifesaving drugs
are toxic in too high doses. Potassium chloride injected quickly into the
heart will stop it and kill you, but you will also die from not enough
potassium.

	Selenium, in small doses ~50-100 mcg/day, is an anti-oxidant and quite
safe. It aids the action of Vitamin E.

	To my suprise, I've seen pyrogallic acid  ointment 28% sold over the
counter as a treatment for bunions!

Does anyone have an explanation for the overall brown appearance of both the
normal and warmtone sets when using the 1 - 5 pens?  I've had to resort to
more traditional methods with inks to avoid this problem when cleaning up
prints. Someone told me that it occurs with warmtone developers {my
preferrence) but it seems to happen with colder types also. As for spotting
toned prints.......?  In order to circumvent the " Clean-up your act "
suggestions, its often an annoying highlight I just want to adjust rather
than a question of a dirty print. 
I'm a new member, from a mention in Camera & Darkroom - great mag for the
enthusiast.

Robert,

thanks for the reply. I have checked my computer and indeed the clock must
have set itself to 1980 over the millenium- it's sorted now.
Your reply  was punctuated with some rather strange characters: 

>Re. Julian Smart&#8217;s communication 15 01 00
>1 Yes, by all means give out a certificate. It could act
>as a reference / record or guarantee.
>2 A minor point. Please check your computer. The Email date shows 1980
>3 Lith Printing. Buy, read and most important, WORK THROUGH
>Dr Rudman&#8217;s books. 

I don't know if this was caused by the previous problem but haven't seen it
before and I have recieved hundreds of e-mails this year.

I have found the Dr. Rudman book to be excellent, and indeed I couldn't
have even started without it. It does, of course, lead one to discover
problems for which there are apparently no easy answers- watch this space.

Regards,

Julian Smart.

I've gone to John Sexton's print workshop and I can wholeheartedly
recommend it.  He's got lots of experience, he's a great teacher and
and a very nice person.

Yes, the majority of the workshops are held in his darkroom located in
his house in Carmel Valley.  This a couple hours south of San Francisco
near the coast.  Occasionally, some are held in other locations such as 
Colorado and Maine.

They are a very intense five days of photography.

Check out:

and also

There ought to be a new brochure coming out soon, so if you are interested
get on the mailing list ASAP by calling them on the phone.  In general
they fill up very quickly.

I've attended two of Howard Bond's workshops, and recommend them.  
Lots of great prints to examine, both his and others.  Plenty of darkroom 
time printing students' negatives.  He is a great teacher, and real nice 
guy.

I've been to two of Howard Bonds printing workshops, both the 
basic and advanced.  I would highly recommend Howard, you really 
can learn a lot from him, someone mentioned that he was probably 
the worlds "best living printer".  Howard has a pretty extensive 
collection of fine prints from Ansel, Weston, ect, it's really nice to 
see the prints up close not behind glass.  One other benefit of 
Howards classes is the price, he is more than reasonable.  
Classes are held in Ann Harbor MI.

I have heard that John Sexton does a good job.  I have also heard 
that Bruce Barnbaum has an ego problem, from more than one 
person.  Who needs that?  So as far as I'm concerned he is not 
even an option. 

Hope this helps

Steve

I have a ton of vintage Hollywood portrait 8x10 negatives from the old 
studios.  Mostly they are from the 1930's and 1940's.  Clark Gable, Joan 
Crawford, Bette Davis, Kate Hepburn and many others.  I can easily make a 
contact print but I want to make large prints.  

Where can I get an enlarger that will accomodate 8x10 negatives to make large 
prints?  Is it difficult???

Thanks!!!

You ask the age old question.  Well there are a couple of different things you
can do, if you have an 8x10 camera it would be very easy to make a or buy a light
source and jury rig a negative holder.  Or the other end of the spectrum is to
buy a new 8x10 enlarger with a cold light head or pulsed xenon light source for
upwards of 20-30000 dollars.  If you have a Beselar 4x5 enlarger they make a kit
that will let you do 8x10 negs,  the kit is about $2500.
        So I hope that I have govern you an idea of what the range of
availability of 8x10 enlargers

8x10 enlargers tend to be big and expensive.  I mean big.  You had better
measure the height of your ceiling and carefully think whether you want to
devote that much space to an enlarger.

For new ones capable of B&W, the best approach is probably 8x10 heads made for
4x5 enlargers.  The advantages are comparatively reasonable size and cost.  The
two that I know of are the Beseler and the Zone VI sold by Calumet.  Part of
the way these adapters work on 4x5 enlargers is to use a shorter than normal
lens.

There are many models available used and the prices can be a very low fraction
of the original cost.   Professional quality 8x10 enlargers are being abandoned
because of the digital imaging revolution.   Several used dealers carry them
and they show up about weekly on ebay.   Some brands to consider are Durst and
Devere.  This would probably be the only afforable way to obtain a color
8x10 enlarger, which you don't need, expect perhaps as an easy way to use
variable contrast paper.

  The cheapest are probably the old Elwoods. They are somewhat crude but
servicable. Since they were table models you can get away without a 12 foot
ceiling. Most Elwood enlargers will need a new lamphouse. Aristo makes one
off the shelf for them for around $1000.
  Another oldie to watch out for is the Saltzman. These things look like
vertical milling machines and are built like Swiss watches. They are very
heavy (you need a concrete floor) and tall. Again, you may need a new
lamphouse. Most of them originally had mercury vapour heads but many were
equipped with color heads. Often they are sold very cheap provided you come
with a truck and some muscular friends and take it away.

Personally I wouldn't try to enlarge such gems... If the density of the
negatives is right for the process, try making platinum prints... you will
probably be amazed at the quality of the results.

I could suggest another "work around."  Make your best contact print
(and you could use contact print paper, or VC paper, projecting through
various filters) and then copy it with medium format.  I've read that
Eugene Smith might spend hours getting just the right dodge and burn on
a "master print," then he would make a 4X5 copy negative to be able to
crank out copies.  My guess is those Hollywood portraits might be a
little soft to begin with, so the usual concern with detail wouldn't be
a factor.  Let us know how it turns out.

Ralph Gleason did this also, in 35mm.

If you insist on an 8X10 enlarger, haunt the big camera 
show/swapmeets listed in Shutterbug. I often see old 8X10 enlargers 
for sale there, at bargain prices.

Hi Bill !
As you may have noticed form my signature, I live in France...
I've asked for 2$ at my bank.... It is difficult to get.... so small
amounts, and postal regulation prohibit sending money on letters.
So as I've read on the list, I ask you, would you be interested in
French notes ?
(2 USD would be 15 FF, rounded to 20 (a standard note ))
If yes, I'll sendthem to you this week end.
Cheers !

Harry,

I've attended all three photographers workshops (Sexton, Bond, Barnbaum) 
during the last 10 years.

John Sexton has impeccable darkroom technique, but even more importantly, is 
a great teacher and communicator. I would recommend him highly.

Howard Bond is a master printer and has the most extensive collection of 
photography (of Weston, Adams, Tice, etc.) of the three. He is a great guy, 
outstanding teacher, but I haven't been to a workshop since he has been 
using unsharp masking. (I prefer his pre-mask work.)

Bruce Barnbaum is probably the best printer that I know. He has been accused 
of having a master ego here, but I think of the three, he is the most frank 
and honest in portfolio review. It is a fine line to walk, but Bruce was 
devastating during my first review with him about 4 years ago. In 
retrospect, all his comments were gentle and appropriate, but having someone 
truly measuring your work to the highest standard can be humbling. I know it 
was for me.

So in summary, be prepared for an honest review of your work at Bruce's 
workshop. He was the most helpful of the three in truly improving my 
printing and photography in general.

Regards,

Will Varnell
Birmingham, Alabama

I still consider myself a neophyte, when it comes to darkroom work.  Anyhow, I

  Agfa seems to have revised their times for some films fairly recently.
Kodak is clear that their recommended times are for diffusion printing.
Ilford seems to give times for condenser printing. Agfa has less technical
data than either of the others.

When working with Delta 100 just be aware the tech & PR folks at Ilford say
Delta 100 and ID11 is the finest combination on the market.

This won't change what you are doing but if you get the yen to experiment
some, that is their pick as to the overall finest combination for it.

As a matter of fact, pick up 10 rolls of d3200 in 120 and a bottle of DDX.  
The place I ordered my stuff made a mistake on the DDX and sent 28oz bottle of 
ilfotec HC(HC had DDX store id number).  So, I have some fun times ahead, just 
need to order some more d100 and d400.

New Years Resolution to myself, pick a subject and shoot more photos.

Sorry, to waste bandwidth, and people's time, but what is a "neophyte"?

In practice, all manufactures' development times are for rough guidance
only. I have never found any degree of consistency between manufacturers, or
within a manufacturer's range of products. If you follow the instructions,
you will probably not go badly wrong, but you might not get what you really
want. My experience is Rodinal (one of my favourites unless I am printing
big ;-) to be very tolerant to changes in development time without loss of
quality. I use it regularly with Delta 400.

An exception, in my experience, is Paterson FX-39. The recommended times
seem to me to be very much too short across the board, but most especially
with their own Acupan film. However, small changes in time can produce
radical changes in the resulting negative. Weird! OTOH, this developer is
capable of producing exceptionally good results with some experiment, but it
is just too frightening to use in case I get it wrong.

Regards,
Alistair

Hello, I'm new to this email listserv conference. I
just obtained a Calumet view camera (old gray
monorail) and a modern Nikkor W 135/5.6. I plan on
doing a calibration using Plus-X with Xtol 1:1. I
develop in a system like the one Phil Davis described,
1.5" PVC pipe with threaded caps that hold the
different solutions. I roll them around in a tempered
68 deg water bath. Works great. The question I have is
this: is Plus-X in Xtol 1:1 a good starting point to
do a calibration? It seems that once you put the
effort into a system, it is yours for a while since it
took some effort. I'm just starting out in Zone
specific work and it seems that Plus-X is pretty tried
and true, and is a fine grained film that doesn't have
some of the "problems" that the tabular films seem to
have. That is why I picked it. And Xtol is real easy
to work with, dissolves well, and doesn't smell bad. I
have also heard good things about it and my pro shop
has tons of it real fresh. 1:1 to give me some longer
times so I can have some leeway and not end up with
N-2 times that are too short to be effective. 
 
So Plus-X in Xtol 1:1 - what do you all think? A good
start? I have access to a Saunders 4500 with a
diffusion dichro head. I mostly shoot landscapes and
other stationary objects (factories, I love
smokestacks. Also running water). I like white whites,
black blacks, and the ease and speed of RC. 
 
Thanks in advance for any replies.

p.s. If anyone is interested I can post some photos of
the development tube setup I built. Cost $30 at Home
Depot for the material to build 6 tubes with 12 caps.

Just out of curiosity, are there any reasons for not choosing T-Max or Delta
for zone system work? I am quite new to photografy, and I have never tried
stuff like Plus-X. Currently I am using TMX and TMY in D76, but admittedly I
have not tried to do N-1 or N+1 development.
I have also read that some people find TMax negs harder to print, and this
is not what I need (my pictures a crummy anough as it is :).

If you work with Xtol, be aware of a few things. First, use Distilled or
purified water, not spring water or tap water. Almost all the
inconsistencies reported with Xtol are with water that is not controlled
tightly. I had the usual problems with Xtol & all went away when I switched
to Culligan Bottled Water(reverse osmosis with some minerals added  for
taste).

Xtol is sensitive to iron, chlorine, hard water and organic content, all
problems with normal tap water systems.

Be sure to use 100ml stock minimum for each 8x10 unit of film developed.

If you mix & store it, keep away from the one litre packages. These are the
ones most have trouble with & the 5 litre ones will make enough that any
minor variances will be taken away with the volume.

Thanks. I mixed some up with our fine providence tap
water to at least try it. For my calibration I will
use distilled water.

I use 40 cc of stock and 40 cc of water to develop 1
4x5 sheet one shot in my tubes. I think this should
work out fine.

My pro shop seems to have the 1 liter and the 50 liter
setups. Should I mix up 4 packages in 4 liters? This
store has a huge turnover in supplies so the stuff is
pretty fresh and seems to be kept well. 

Thanks for all your help. I'll keep you posted as to
how it comes out, times etc.

Joshua,

    On package size. Kodak has had most of the problems associated with Xtol
in the 1 litre packages. They have had a problem with sealing them properly.
They say it is fixed now, so you might be OK. The 5 litre package is a much
better buy. I get it that way & mix into a one gallon jug & did my
calibrations & testing that way as it is difficult to find 5 litre jugs,
etc. here in Utah.

    Many Xtol users report it working just fine & then they get a set of
negatives with 'no density'. It is not consistent at all. This is normally
solved by using the distilled or purified water sources. The stuff is quite
sensitive at the weaker dilutions especially. But don't take chances as it
will bite you just when you have a really important negative in the
developer. I went round & round with the Kodak Tech guys for a few months
until we figured out the realities of just how sensitive it really is. Good
water and no more problems at all since then.

    The amount of stock solution just needs to be about 100ml per 8x10 unit
with Kodak & Ilford, and for some strange reason, twice that for Agfa and
Fuji. Jobo testing shows it needs the greater concentration for some reason.
Don't know about Bergger and some of the other esoteric brands, but I would
run a basic test first to see if it works OK.

    Good luck. Xtol is a good product. I have been corresponding with the
Kodak scientist who developed it & she is really proud of the stuff-also
realistic as to both its shortcomings and potential. Nice to talk with
someone who knows their stuff.

Good Luck, Joshua, but I'd suggest you give a little thought to the
quality and versatility of the best fiber papers as compared to your,
"--ease and speed of RC--" .  Regards,  Bill

Joshua, et al.
	I've been mostly lurking on this list, but Joshua's question reminded
me to plug a book I have found invaluable.  It's _The Film and
Developing Cookbook_ by Anchell and Troop, focal press (www.bh.com).
This is a very informative discussion of films and developers, with a
wealth of information and not a few controversial opinions.
	More to the point, neither they nor I are particularly impressed with
Plus-X.  We both like Verichrome Pan, although there are rumors of its
being discontinued, and I think it's only available in 120.  With the
format advantage you have with 4X5, (grain not an issue) why not go with
Tri-X?

I second Phil's recommendation of Anchell and Troop's book -- there is no
other book like it.  You might also look at Ed Buffaloe's website,
www.unblinkingeye.com., it's a great source of information.

But, to follow up with a question to Phil Stiles:  where have you heard that
Verichrome Pan will be discontinued?  I don't know when it was last
available in 35mm, but I use it in 120 and would be very unhappy not to have
it.

Dear Friends:

I picked up a used 35mm Watson Model 100 bulk film loader in very good
shape.

It came with no instructions, but is relatively easy to figure out.

I have one question.  There was a piece of plastic inside that I cannot
identify.  It is "U" shaped with a hole in the middle, a little over 1 inch
square.

Does anyone use a Watson and know what this "U" shaped piece is used for?

I've scanned a picture of it that you can see at:

http://members.aol.com/k7mp/watson.jpg

Thanks for any help,

John Shuster
Port Orchard, WA

This shim is normally on the inside of the loader on the crank side.  When
you push in the winding crank, the shaft passes through a hole in the shim.
 You will see that it actually fits there, and is the proper shape.  

The only time it is NOT used is when you are loading Leica cassettes, which
are presumably a bit wider than ordinary cassettes.

I don't know if I'm spreading a false rumor, or on the cusp of the wave.
I saw this "VP to be discontinued" somewhere in my web wanderings, and
can't recall where.  It stuck with me, because it seemed like something
Kodak might do, and it's one of my favorite films. Hopefully, it's
false.  I used to buy it for my Brownie Hawkeye camera back in the
Fifties, and recently discovered its fine grain and rich tonality when
used in my Rolleiflex.  Ilford's FP4+ is also a nice film in this speed
range. 
	Thanks for the tip on www.unblinkingeye.com.  A very interesting site.
	Phil

  AFAIK Verichrome Pan was never available in 35mm. It was available in a
variety of roll-film sizes and in film packs. 120 roll film is the only
size Kodak currently produces in any emulsion. V-Pan is also made in 8" by
5' rolls for Cirkut cameras.
  As far as Anchell and Troop, do they indicate _which_ Plus-X they are not
impressed with? there are two very different emulsions sold under than
name. The roll-film and 35mm film is a medium-toe general purpose film. The
sheet film is a very long toe (actually its almost all toe) film meant for
studio work. The tonal reproduction of the two types is very different.
  The H&D curve for Plus-X roll film is very similar to Verhichrome Pan but
is not the same emulsion.

My net escapades lately have led me to believe that
Tri-X was just an all around better film for
appearances sake. I may be rethinking my decision.
Grain was an issue with the friend who recommended
Plus-x since he was mainly using 35mm. He somehow
convinced me that the smaller grain would be better
even in 4x5 (enlargements possibly up to 16x20, hit
the ceiling after that). 

So what is it about Tri-x that is better? Better
tonality, better shadow detail? I know grain isn't
everything. 

Thanks for all the help.

I would like to say that I have used a lot of Tri-x in my day.  I am of the
opinion that Tri-x Pro (that which you can only get in sheet films) is not
the same as Tri-x found in 35mm and 120.  The Tri-x Pro is a long toed film
that allegedly is susceptible to flare.  It is best used in studio
conditions where you can control the lighting.  That is the company line.
Now, I have used this film for several years in different lighting
conditions and it has preformed very nice for me.  I use a lot of Tmy and
Tmx now.  I have used Ilford's  HP5+ when I want to use Pyro.

For the neophyte zone system worker, I would recommend the Ilford brand of
films.  They seem to my eye to respond like old type emulsions.  They are
certainly more forgiving.  I would recommend buying this film in Hollywood
at Freestyle Photo.  They sell a house brand of film called Arista.  I can
not tell the difference and several of the glitteratti  in the Photo World
can not either.  You can get a very big price break by using this film,
Example:  Arista 400 (I think it is HP5+) sells for $38.00 per box of 25.
HP5+ sells for around $75.00 per box of 25.  So, 1/2 price is a pretty good
deal.  I can not find the URL at this moment but I am sure one of the other
subscribers has it and would be nice enough to post it.

As for as film character, I will let each person determine that.  So much of
the character depends on how it is exposed and developed and then printed.
It really becomes a personal decision.  One that is best left to each
photographer.
As usual,
Lee Carmichael

Joshua,
	I find Tri-X in Xtol to have the grain of the old Plus-X in D-76. 
Speed generally helps.  Higher shutter speed or smaller aperture, either
way, you get a "sharper" image.  View cameras don't have fast lenses.
	I find Tri-X the "standard," perhaps because I've shot so much of it
over the years, although I'm shooting a lot of Ilford film lately. (3200
at 1200, and FP4+.)
	 From Anchell & Troop:
	"Kodak Tri-X has been the most popular fast film since it was
introduced back in 1954. For its fast speed it has moderately fine
grain, high sharpness, and excellent tolerance to underexposure and
overexposure.  Of all the fast films this one is the most versatile.  It
can be pushed as much as three stops with acceptable results.  Tri-X's
unrivaled flexibilty ensures its continued popularity."
	Buy the book!
	Phil

Arrrghhh!! It seems that the sheet versions of a lot
of popular films are different and are meant for
studio work. In a nutshell I am looking for a film
that will behave well when it comes to applying Zone
controls. I guess I'm looking for an emulsion that
works like the "old" emulsions AA described. Someone
recomended Ilford HP5+ as a good candidate, but I have
an easier time getting kodak films. From the advice I
have received it seems I should hold off using Tmax
and other tabular films until I have everything under
very tight wraps when it comes to my actual technique
since they are very sensitive to time etc.

Flexibility seems is the way to go here! However is
the sheet emulsion of Tri-X different than the film
they are commenting on here. It seems that Tri-x may
be the "starter" film I'm looking for to use in my new
foray into the world of Zone System technique. In
reading "The Quiet Light" by John Sexton, until he
switched to Tmax he was using Tri-X a lot. Plus-X
never came up, should have been a big hint for me
right there. Flexibility.....

Dan,

I knew half the story on the "Watson loader" question you answered, but
thanks for the added info re Leica cassettes... I was thinking of glueing
the insert in place because it worked in that position with a bunch of AM-1
cassettes I have for my Nikon F2s... but I'll hold back on the sticky stuff
as I may pick up some Leica cassettes eventually.

Cheers,

Slightly off topic but still tangentially relevant, a few years ago I began
toting an old Kodak 35 and was impressed by optics. To see what it really
could do, I began using Ilford Pan-F+ (ISO 50) processed in Rodinal for
maximum sharpness.

Suddenly, I found I was making prints from 35mm negatives that looked like
MF. I have now switched to Pan-F+ for almost all medium format work as well,
with the same leap forward.

Pan-F is a slightly contrasty film with good latitude that easily is pushed
or pulled. Its fine grain makes for superb enlargements. But the quality,
above all, that makes it my film of choice (although I suspect Agfa 25 and
tech pan are as good or better, just not quite as fast) is sharpness.

Although often overlooked, sharpness is, in part, a function of emulsion
thickness, which is, in part, a function of film speed. Slower films have
thinner emulsions, hence sharper images. The following is from a 1948 book,
"35-mm Photo Technique," by H.S. Newcombe, a splendid little book, by the
way, filled with all sorts of interesting things like developer formulas,
intensifiers, reducers, etc.

"The emulsion on different films may differ somewhat in thickness. Slow
films can be made thinner than those which are more rapid. There is a good
deal of merit in a thin emulsion. When the light which forms the image
strikes the surface of the film, it passes in through the emulsion itself;
and as it is a turgid medium, it becomes dispersed and scattered so that it
affects the sensitive substance all around the spot at which it first
entered the film. It is easy to see that the thinner the film the less the
light will be scattered, and the sharper will be the image of a point of
light on development. Most slow films on the market are on the thin side--
fast emulsions incline to be thicker. Therefore, even apart from the grain
itself, a slow emulsion may produce a sharper picture, that is, one which is
capable of greater enlargement, than will one of the more rapid materials.
Or, as we say, the slow film is capable of greater resolution than the
other."

Of course everyone has his or her own choice of film, for a variety of
reasons, and that is why recommending a particular film for other than a
special situation is inherently dangerous. But my own experience is that,
once you can get beyond the angst of losing a stop or stop-and-a half in
speed, to go with the slow is not bad way to go.

I'm guessing N+1, if it's raining and whatnot, plus it'd help to really
emphasize the texture of the floodwaters.

I have tried all the liquid emulsions over here in the UK and despite some
suggestions to the contrary I have found them to be unsuitable. The only one
that would is made to special order by Kentmere using their Kentona emulsion
but I understand there are technical probs and it is not generally
available.
Some will give a lithy colour which disappears in the fixer - not suitable
for keeping/hanging long term.
I don't know about all the US liquid emulsions though.

John,

I had almost given up on using 35mm film as I just could not get the
required degree of sharpness/fine grain and useable contrast from the
films/developers I was using. Then I discovered Tech. Pan/Technidol and the
Holy Grail appeared. Trouble is my current 35mm gear is out performed by
the film.....
BTW the slower films are often coated on a thinner film base (especially)
Tech. Pan. This will have some bearing on inherent sharpness due to less
diffusion of the image during enlargement. It also means that 140 ft. of
film can be loaded into a Watson (and kept in the dark because the felt
light trap will  no longer function properly!!)

Hello All,

I have heard that it is possible to lith print some of the liquid emulsions
available and would very much like to give it a go.

Has anyone tried this? If so what papers (I'm only interested in artists
papers) might I try and what might be the implications regarding
contrast/colour control and subsequent toning. It might prove expensive but
could be worth it.

Thanks in advance,

Julian Smart.

  Its the same with Tri-X except both types of emulsion are available in
roll film.
  The roll film is the "old" Tri-X, the sheet stuff is a very long toe film
with slightly slower speed. 
   Since the contrast of these very long toe films rises almost throughout
the curve there isn't much difference made by adjusting exposure. Once the
exposure is sufficent to record the shadow areas with some detail increased
exposure does not make a lot of difference. The contrast of the shadows is
always going to be low compared to the highlights.  The effect of the long
toe is to depress the values of the middle tones when a given shadow and
highlight point are chosen.  I don't think these are good zone system films.
  Ilford and Agfa seem to coat pretty much the same emulsion on all formats
of films sold under the same name. I don't know why Kodak chose to sell
very different films under virtually the same name. As far as I can tell
the only Kodak sheet films with medium or short toes are the T-Max films.
Tri-X, Plus-X, and Ektapan are all long toe films. Ilford FP-4 and HP-5 are
medium toe and should respond well to zone system manipulation. Agfa
Agfapan 100 is another good medium toe film. Agfa has recently discontinued
Agfapan 400 in sheet film sizes.
  T-Max films change contrast more rapidly with time than other films. If
you control timing and agitation well they should respond well to the zone
system. A 20% change in development time for T-Max will produce as much
change in conrast as a 30% change for most other film.
  One problem with T-Max is that it can reach very high densities. Its
often accused of blocking up but actually its the printing medium which
blocks up. The gamma of even these very dense highlights is high enough to
separate tones, its just thay they are beyond the range of conventional
printing paper. This great range of densities is actually an advantage for
some alternative printing processes.
 It would be dandy if Kodak still made Super-XX in sheets or even the
roll-film version of Plus-X in sheets.

I would be cautious about the applicability of statements about 1948 film
technology to today's films.  There have been immense advances since then.

Have you tried Bergger BPF 200... It is supposed to be similar to Super-XX.

It is a shame. Just think if Coca-Cola tasted
different just because it came from a 2 liter bottle
vs. a can. I am realizing that I should probably
calibrate with Tmax films evn though I've been told
they are "difficult" to use. I'll have to get
everything down perfectly, including temperature. 

Reading the spec sheet on Tmax films they mention
"ease of zone system manipulations" referring to the
smaller time adjustments that are needed. I just
noticed - this is the only film that the Zone System
is even mentioned in the spec sheet! Plus-X is
described as "appropriate for medium and full
lighting" which probably wouldn't help on a moonlit
night. I guess you need a lot of light to come over
that toe. 

Hopefully it will be warm enough in Providence this
sunday for me to spend some time outside to get some
metered shots of the grey wall behind my building. If
I'm lucky it will be overcast.

Thanks for all of your help.

One nice feature of the TMax films is that they do contact print well with
Azo paper.

Also, if you want to manipulate the development, as you say above, they do
push and pull easily. Their downfall for many photographers is the real need
for tight control-temp, agitation and developer dilutions-every step of the
way. 'Hold your mouth wrong' and your TMax goes crazy. But if you process
with control & repeatability, the stuff is excellent.

Folks,

Isn't it good to hear about problems which you did not know exist  ?

I switched to Xtol from ID11 2 or 3 years ago, and have used litres of
the stuff. Never any suggestion of a problem.

Our water is very hard - Island just off the (Old) Hampshire coast, but
the darkroom has Liff in line water filters fitted to both hot and cold
supplies (diagram published in Creative Monochrome's "Mono" magazine
some while ago).

To be fair, I always buy the 5 litre pack, and use it neat.

Have processed Delta 100 & 400, Neopan 1600, Kodak I/R, Tmax 100 & 3200
- just great negs.

Yours,

Glyn Edmunds EFIAP

Joshua,

    On package size. Kodak has had most of the problems associated with Xtol
in the 1 litre packages. They have had a problem with sealing them properly.
They say it is fixed now, so you might be OK. The 5 litre package is a much
better buy. I get it that way & mix into a one gallon jug & did my
calibrations & testing that way as it is difficult to find 5 litre jugs,
etc. here in Utah.

    Many Xtol users report it working just fine & then they get a set of
negatives with 'no density'. It is not consistent at all. This is normally
solved by using the distilled or purified water sources. The stuff is quite
sensitive at the weaker dilutions especially. But don't take chances as it
will bite you just when you have a really important negative in the
developer. I went round & round with the Kodak Tech guys for a few months
until we figured out the realities of just how sensitive it really is. Good
water and no more problems at all since then.

    The amount of stock solution just needs to be about 100ml per 8x10 unit
with Kodak & Ilford, and for some strange reason, twice that for Agfa and
Fuji. Jobo testing shows it needs the greater concentration for some reason.
Don't know about Bergger and some of the other esoteric brands, but I would
run a basic test first to see if it works OK.

    Good luck. Xtol is a good product. I have been corresponding with the
Kodak scientist who developed it & she is really proud of the stuff-also
realistic as to both its shortcomings and potential. Nice to talk with
someone who knows their stuff.

  I meant to add about temperature. This is evident from comparing time and
temperature data for T-Max vs: standard films of similar speed.
  I use T-Max a lot with very good results but I am a careful worker. The
very fine grain and sharpness make T-Max attractive but I also like the
tonal reproduction of T-Max 400. I use D-76 1:1 for it. Although times are
not given for sheet films at this dilution its easy to interpolate from
roll film data. For me this film gives a very smooth "creamy" quality which
I like very much for portraits. All formats of the film seem to be similar.

Can someone please explain "short toe" versus long-toe.  Been developing
B&W for about 10 years and have so many books on the subject, but to be
honest,
I have never heard this phrase.

Is short toe desired?  If so, when?

I am a dedicated T-Max user in the 35 mm format. I know the difficulties of 
35 mm and any allusions to Zone Systems in the classical sense (AA).  However 
I persist and now bulk load rolls of 15 exposures with the hope to adjust 
development by the roll not the image.  I am very satisfied with processing 
with the Jobo controlling temperature and agitation, I produce consistently 
'true' negs.

My question to all is:
given:   >> The gamma of even these very dense highlights is high enough to 
separate tones, its just that they are beyond the range of conventional 
printing paper. (Richard Knoppow)<<

What paper(s) do you feel can reach and adequately separate those highlights 
with enlargement printing?

-Thanks, Bruce

I am sure there are more qualified people out there but the way I have heard
and use the phrases refers to the H&D curves.  This is the way sensitromty
sees the film in a graph form.  In the low end of film, that is the toe, in
the middle it is the straight line and the top is the shoulder.  Old
technology films were made to have short toes and at some point they would
shoulder off.  In a sense they would start to block up and not record the
image any more.The short toed films retain their film speeds more readily
than long toed films.  The Tmax films are short toed and seem to not have a
shoulder.  There is some debate if the photographic papers can record the
detail in the very high portion of the scale ( say above zone IX).  If I am
spreading rumors please correct me.  It has been a long time since I studied
this.
As usual,
Lee Carmichael

I'll give this a shot, and maybe learn something in the process.
	If you graph the response of an emulsion to light, so that you are
plotting negative density (verticle axis) against exposure (horizontal
axis) you might expect a line crossing your graph at forty five
degrees.  As exposure increases, density increases proportionally.  In
the real world, the line is not straight, or forty five degrees.
	If you have a fast film with a wide range (capturing good gradation in
the shadows) the "toe" of the curve will be long.  On the other end,
there's a "shoulder," where you have reached maximum density, and
further exposure has little effect.
	So, a high contrast copy film has a short, steep curve with little
"toe."  A film with wide latitude (Delta 3200?) will have a longer
curve, or "long toe."  Most of us, in photo terms, are "pictorialists,"
seeking for the most part to capture the range of tones we see in the
real world. (Granted, I may be just speaking for my self here.)  So the
long toe Tri-X gives good results, because the real world does have an
enormous tonal range.  I could imagine a situation, very misty seascape
in the fog, perhaps, where the contrast range of the scene is so
compressed that a short toe might be useful.
	Comments welcomed.
	Phil

A metaphor to be played with: women curves from toes to shoulders.  (Sorry
gals, guys "curves" aren't so obvious to me)  How do the clothes fit?  Tall
and willowy vs. short and "abundant".  All toe vs. too much shoulder.
Toreador trousers vs bi-ki-ni.  Big feet vs.tiny feet.  Clothes could be the
relative fit of the PAPER CURVE (S) to the FILM CURVES  Graphs are useful,
metaphors memorable.

As a relative novice to the zone system I would greatly appreciate advice on 
exposure and development  for a high key subject - say a white feather on a 
very pale background. I would want as subtle a rendering as possible, not a 
contrasty one( if that were conceivable) . Thanks, Saffron Branfoot.

Chuck (and everyone else):

pure-silver's charter was purposely written so that messages of the type
Chuck is asking about *ARE* permitted (for clarification, see
http://www.tundraware.com/pure-silver)  In general, I have no
problem with commercial messages of *any* kind so long as they
follow these general guidelines:

1) Commercial messages must related directly to B&W photography.
2) Commercial messages should be posted only once unless someone
   asks for a repeat (in which case it should be sent via email
   directly to the requester and not the whole list).

In general, the intent was to leave room for new product announcements,
workshop announcements, and such, not to create an on-line advertising
forum for everyone with a product to flog.  Also, each of you is free to
post For Sale/For Auction notices here *once* per item...


For the record, I went to Chuck's Zion workshop a couple of years ago and just
had a ball.  Chuck's workshops are probably most appropriate for the beginner
to intermediate level photographer on the *technical* side of things, but
a lot of fun for all levels of photographer on the interaction and social side
of the coin.  In other words, if you're an advanced photographer looking for
a deeply technical workshop, this ain't it.  Chuck's workshops tend to emphasize
individual direction by the leaders and a lot of time is spent thinking about
and talking about how to "see" the image you want.  The portfolio reviews of 
everyone's work are just great.  Chuck is a true gentleman, scholar, judge of
fine wine, and his wife, Marta, is even nicer (and MUCH prettier ;)  If you've 
never been to a workshop, this is a terrific way to get started - the price is
very reasonable, the company is great (many people repeat Chuck's workshops,
just for the interaction among old friends), and you'll come away saturated in
photography.

So, Chuck, knock your socks off - tell us the Who/What/When/Where/How/How Much
of your next workshop.  Be sure to include your contact information so people
who are interested can contact you privately...

I am in a quandary.  I don't have a scale but I need to measure 300 grams of
Kodalk to make Part B of PMK Pyro.  I realize that the comparisons are not
readily compatible one being weight and the other being volume.  So, my
question is how many grams fit in one cup?  Any help would be appreciated
greatly.  On Page 19 of the Book Of Pyro he gives the formula for Kodak
Fixer F-24 "Spoon formula" and One heaping tablespoon = 40 grams.  Below
that he states that 1/3 cup = 100 grams.  I make the assumption that 300
grams is = to one cup.  Anybody have a problem with that?  Thanks ahead of
time.
As usual,
Lee Carmichael

 Lee Carmichael's explanation is about right. The difference in the curves
can be thought of as a difference in contrast for shadows than for mid
tones or highlights.
 Kodak seems to feel that very long toe film is desirable for studio work.
Both Tri-X and Plus-X sheet film, and Ektapan are long toe films. To see
the difference in the curves download the data booklets for either Tri-X or
Plus-X from the Kodak site. Both booklets cover both versions of each film
and have curves for them in the back.
  Plus-X sheet film has the most pronounced toe. In fact, the curve seems
to have increasing contrast throughout with no real "straight line" section
at all. If one compares the densities along the curve to a straight line,
with the line intersecting the film curve at a shadow and highlight point,
you will find that the deisities of the film fall below the line. In
practice that means that when these two points are chosen to be the maximum
shadow and maximum highlight points of the print the mid tones will be
darker than for a straight line film. Kodak indicates these films are for
studio work where "brilliant highlights" are desired. Obviously the
characteristic will give the illusion of brighter highlights because it is
making the mid tones darker.
  Most films have a medium toe. By increasing exposure the shadow areas of
an image can be pushed up the characteristic towards the straight line
point if more shadow contrast is desired. This doesn't work for Plus-X
sheet film since there is no straight line portion.
  Some films have very short toes. The old Super-XX is a good example.
T-Max films also seem to have relatively short toes. I think this may make
these films somewhat unforgiving of exposure since the shadow contrast will
always be high. If you underexpose the shadow detail disappears rapidly.
The medium toe of most general purpose films gives them some tollerance for
underexposure.
  Lens flare to some degree produces an effect like a long toe. i.e. it
tends to reduce shadow contrast but does not affect highlight contrast very
much. Kodak suggests its very-long-toe sheet films for use with low flare
lenses under low flare lighting conditions. 
  Where uncoated lenses are used a short or medium toe film is a better
choice.
  Modern films do not have a shoulder until you reach very high levels of
over exposure. The shoulder of older films could cause highlight blocking
since the contrast of the film for highlights would become very low. This
is a little different situation than one has with a film like T-Max which
can reach very high densities. In T-Max there is still detail in the film.
By burning in highlights, or using a paper like Ilford Multigrade IV, which
has a long toe of its own, the hightlight detail can be brought out. Films
like the late lamented Kodak Super Panchro Press, Type B (the "type-B"
refers to its sensitisation) ran out of density and shouldered off at
relatively low values of density. They tended to block highlights but there
was nothing you could do in printing to bring them back. They were just not
on the film.
  For those interested in a practical demonstration of the effects of curve
shape can compare the same scene shot with Plus-X (because it has the most
extreme toe) and T-Max or a medium toe film like Ilford FP-4 or
Agfapan-100.  Choose the same highlight and shadow points on the negatives
to be the maximum shadow and highlight values on the print. Compare the
mid-tones and the overall look of the prints.
  An example: Shooting the waves breaking on rocks at the beach. The water
and sky print much darker compared to the foam when using Plus-X. In this
case it makes the image more dramatic. For many other purposes, it may not
be desirable. I happen to like T-Max 400 for portraits because it produces
relatively light skin tone where Plus-X tends to be too dark.
As always, YMMV.  
  The shape of the curve of a film is pretty much fixed by the distribution
of sensitivity of the halide crystals in the emulsion. The toe area can be
affected somewhat by restrainers in the developer but, in general, there is
no method for processing a long toe film to make it a short toe film, and
vice versa.

  If you are refering to Pyro its not true and is a corruption of another
urban myth, namely that E.Weston and a couple of other well known
photographers had Parkinson's. Weston used Pyro developers. He also used
Amidol (that's why his fingernails were black) but I don't ever hear that
Amidol is a killer. 
  Pyro is toxic. So are several other commonly used reducing agents. Pyro
is probably a bit more toxic than, say, Metol, but some people have an
extreme sensitivity to Metol which makes it dangerous for them to use it. 
  There is absolutely _no_ evidence that any photographic developing agent
is associated with any common desease other than alergic reaction to it.
Especially, there is NO evidence linking any photographic chemical with
either Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. 
  All this is moot if you don't allow the chemical to get in or on your
body. There is no need to in photographic work. If you must tray process
use tongs or gloves. Be aware of fumes and make sure there is good
ventillation. Don't store chemicals in a way where they might be confused
with someting else and be ingested or easily reached by children. And etc,
common precautions, also applicable to houshold cleaners, which are, in
general, more dangerous than photo stuff.

Hi Lee (and others) -

Quander no more!  I spent a lot of time working this out just recently so I
could take advantage of bulk pricing of the chemical components of PMK.
It's a whole lot cheaper to buy a pound of pyro (454 grams) than to buy the
50 grams for one "kit" size bottle.  And I use a lot of this stuff for
everything from Minox to 4x5.

300 grams of sod. metaborate (Kodalk) = 300 cc unit volume

Also, for the rest of the chemistry, I just bought it weighed out by the
supplier.  The whole thing cost about $95 to make up the equivalent of 9 -
50 liter kits.  Remember, these kits sell for $25 each so without doing too
much robust math you can see the savings potential is phenomenal (and the
supplier - a most important link to us all - still makes a profit on the
bulk order).  It's a win-win: you have lots of money left over to buy other
bulk chemicals like fixers and toners  :-)

Regards,
Curt

(The following may not apply to folks outside the U.S. since packaging of
consumer goods varies so much throughout the world.)

While in Walmart today, I happened upon a display of M&Ms candies
called 'minnies'.  These were packaged in a cylinder that looks like
a lipstick container on steroids.  After sucking down the contents of
one of these (I paid for it first), I noticed that the general dimensions
and shape of the container would be perfect for ... hey, it works!
These cases are just the thing for holding 120/220 roll film when
traveling.  At 49 cents a whack, I can spend 10 bucks, cover my roll
film travel protection needs and get a big sugar buzz on all at once...

OK, I've been a photographer for 20+ years and I STILL cannot spot prints
to save my life.  Since I am addicted to 4x5 and the film I love (APX 100)
is not available in readyloads, dust is a reality.  I've read and tried
nearly every approach to this problem with no luck.  My darkroom is
spotless and I am exceedingly careful when loading holders so I doubt
I can make things better this way.

Is anyone out there a spotting expert who would care to share their secret.

In the long run, the best way to solve this problem is to digitize the neg,
fix the spots on a computer, and write out a new piece of film to make a
corrected negative which is theoreticially perfect, but this too
has problems:

1) Film writers of sufficient resolution are REALLY expensive ($7,000 and up)
2) I don't see how to prevent the dust problem in the film writer either.


HELP...

Tim,

    I work in a darkroom with exposed lath & plaster ceilings & aging chalky
walls. At times I have to take little chunks of plaster from chemistry when
working.

    But, I have cut my spotting by about 90% with a few things that work for
me.

    First, when I plug in the cold light head to warm up before a printing
session, I turn on a big Honeywell HEPA air filtering machine. I let both
run for a minimum of 20 minutes. This one alone has made a major difference
in dust(or lack of it) in the printing process.

    When loading my film, I follow the same route & then wipe down holders
lightly with either a damp sponge or lintless cloth(old diapers). This seems
to do better than dust brushes for me as they only move dust around rather
than removing it.

    I still get some dust on film but it is much less than before the filter
& the damp cloth routine.

    One other area I used to mistake for dust on negs is in the use of stop
bath-especially with TMax 100. If I use an acid stop bath, small pinholes I
used to mistake for dust. Not a lot of them, but they are there. If I use
water rinse only, they disappear & I am left just with the dust marks. I
don't quite know why the pinholes with acid stop, even very weak stop, but
when I tried it(on Ilford's suggestion) with just water the problem
dissappeared.

    One other trick I found that works well for me is to carry one of the
squeeze handle static eliminators and/or anti static spray in the car. Every
now & then spray around the camera case and the dust problems 'seem' to be
less. Maybe they aren't, but it seems so. I also use a damp towel once a day
or so on the camera bag outside & then lightly inside as well.

    Since combining these methods my dust problem is much less. Now if
someone has a foolproof system of getting rid of the dust entirely...

We can do it right here (that's the point of the list, after all).  I use
APX 100 for almost everything - anything else is probably TRI-X, although
I hear the old siren songs of Verichrome and Plus-X occasionally and may
jump back into those at some point.

I use APX 100 in both 120 and 4x5, processed in PMK pyro, washed in running
water, and fixed in Formulary TF-4.

I get spectacular negs with this film.  Exposed at EI 50, the shadows are
just right and the pyro gives me infinitely (almost) printable highlights.
I shot the interior of an abandoned mining shack in Montana this summer
which had light just pouring through the windows and was able to print
meaningful hightlights and shadows from that negative.  The natural tonal
range in that room had to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 15-17 zones...
Yikes!

Because of the pyro stain, I am slightly limited in the higher end of contrast
when I print with a Zone VI VC cold light head.  However, this is an
artifact of the developer not the film and can easily be addressed by adjusting
other aspects of darkroom technique.

The only complaint I have about Agfapan 100 is that the 120 version is very
easily scratched, so you have to be very careful when spooling it on to a reel.

Your turn, tell us your APX 100 stories...

I forgot to mention something in my original missive (attached) - I *know* from
reading C&D that Ed and folks in the UK have some very nice shooting opportunities
across the pond (the old Celts knew how to hew stone - Wales alone is worth a
photographer's journey, nevermind Snowdonia and the North).

Anyway, if our friendly Welsh/Irish/Scots/English cousins would care to
share with the class, I for one would love to hear about upcoming workshop
and informal shooting opportunities in their part of the world... I need
an excuse to go there.  I promise not to argue politics or history - well,
other than the politics and history of photography ;))

All of the above applies to the rest of globe as well, however the
Australian contigent here on pure-silver is enjoined from making cracks
about the English ;)

So, one and all, let us know about opportunities for group photography
as they arise, just limit yourself to one announcement per event.

This has been a recording...

Chuck (and everyone else):

pure-silver's charter was purposely written so that messages of the type
Chuck is asking about *ARE* permitted (for clarification, see
http://www.tundraware.com/pure-silver)  In general, I have no
problem with commercial messages of *any* kind so long as they
follow these general guidelines:

1) Commercial messages must related directly to B&W photography.
2) Commercial messages should be posted only once unless someone
   asks for a repeat (in which case it should be sent via email
   directly to the requester and not the whole list).

In general, the intent was to leave room for new product announcements,
workshop announcements, and such, not to create an on-line advertising
forum for everyone with a product to flog.  Also, each of you is free to
post For Sale/For Auction notices here *once* per item...


For the record, I went to Chuck's Zion workshop a couple of years ago and just
had a ball.  Chuck's workshops are probably most appropriate for the beginner
to intermediate level photographer on the *technical* side of things, but
a lot of fun for all levels of photographer on the interaction and social side
of the coin.  In other words, if you're an advanced photographer looking for
a deeply technical workshop, this ain't it.  Chuck's workshops tend to emphasize
individual direction by the leaders and a lot of time is spent thinking about
and talking about how to "see" the image you want.  The portfolio reviews of 
everyone's work are just great.  Chuck is a true gentleman, scholar, judge of
fine wine, and his wife, Marta, is even nicer (and MUCH prettier ;)  If you've 
never been to a workshop, this is a terrific way to get started - the price is
very reasonable, the company is great (many people repeat Chuck's workshops,
just for the interaction among old friends), and you'll come away saturated in
photography.

So, Chuck, knock your socks off - tell us the Who/What/When/Where/How/How Much
of your next workshop.  Be sure to include your contact information so people
who are interested can contact you privately...

Lee:  You would probably be better off getting a scale to weigh out the
components.  It would be far more reproducable and would make your results
more consistant.  Inexpensive scales are available from many office supply
stores for weighing mail.  Digital balances are available from sources like
the Formulary and from better kitchen supply houses.

For a quick and dirty exposure I would suggest placing the feather on Zone
VII and letting the background fall where it may.  I would develop in PMK at
N or possibly at N+xx depending the results that I would want to acheive.
Try it with a film that gives a good response to puro - Tri-X, HP-5+, FP-4+,
Good old Plus X, etc.

Good Luck

Sorry gang about the slow response, but I was out photographing!

First, selenium is not a heavy metal.  It is classified as a metalloid - one
of those elements lurking to the right of the periodic table, which can not
make up its mind if it is a metal or a non-metal.

Trace amounts of selenium are need in animal diets at about 0.1 ppm - Merk
Index, 12th Ed. # 8572.  Yes it is toxic in higher amounts.  See the same
reference for a bunch of references to toxicity studies.  It does occur in
nature and there are some areas of the US - portions of  South Dakota for
one, where the naturally occuring Se levels in plants have caused some
concern - selenium toned chickens.

Sodium selenite (sodium salt of selenious acid) is the active Se compound in
the Kodak toner.  The LD(50) orally in rats is 7 mg/kg (Merk Index, 12th Ed.
#8822).
Selenious acid is easily reduced to selenium by most reducing agents
including sulfurious acid ( and presumably sodium sulfite, and sodium
bisulfite), and sodium hyposulfite  (hypo).( ibid #8571).  Elemental
selenium is insoluble in water. (ibid # 8572).  Sodium selenite also reacts
with hydrogen sulfide to form insoluble selenium sulfides (ibid #8580).
This chemistry is anticipated to take place in a sewage system  where
hydrogen sulfide is usually present.  The LD(50) for selenium disulfide is
reported to be 138 mg/kg (orally in rats).

While the disposal of selenium toner may be either a "real" or "Boogie Man"
issue, the use of proper personal protective equipment ( tongs, gloves,
etc.) in the darkroom, along with good ventilation and darkroom practices
can minimize the exposure to any of the chemicals that we all use.  Most of
the available tox. data out there is from high level, short term  dosages.
There is a paucity of data on long term, low level exposure for many
chemicals.  Some can cause sensitization  (metol for one) and allergic
reactions (Palladium), and some are suspect carcinogens (Amidol - check the
listing in the Aldrich catalog).  Pyro is toxic( moderatly so), readily
absorbed through the skin, and also can cause blood, liver and kidney
changes (back to the good old Merk Index).  I have not seen any reports of
it being linked to Alzheimers or Parkinsons.  The "classical" brown or black
finger nails, these days, would be an indication of POOR darkroom practices.

Most of the chemicals that we handle in the darkroom are quite tame (except
for dichromates and some color , oops, sorry about that word :-))  chemisty)
in comparison the those that I have worked with during 30+ years in the
laboratory.

Any body know the concentration of Sodium Selenite in Rapid Selenium Toner
stock solution?

Dan,

ROTFL... but unfortunately no... I only drink Rooibosch tea from the Cape

Tim,

It's unfair for Aussies to make cracks at our expense... being "down under"
they have it easy with large format because the images on their viewing
screens are all the right way up!  8-0

Tim Daneliuk asked,
Is anyone out there a spotting expert who would care to share their
secret.[?]

	I actually enjoy spotting.  There's a sense of magic in making those
spots disappear.  Of course, I don't enjoy dealing with too many of
them.
	One of my secrets is a binocular magnifier with head band that I bought
at Sears for less than $20.  It has plastic lenses, but is quite
comfortable.  The magnification is like having double loupes, although
the quality of the image is not as great.  It frees both hands, and lets
one get really close to the work.
	I like to have the print sitting in an easel (so it's held at much the
same angle you might hold a book), with a very bright light (sometimes I
mix daylight and strong incandescent), and a test piece of print paper
of similar emulsion.
	Spotting colors are applied with a small brush, although I find that
the smallest brushes are the least handy.  They just don't hold enough. 
A slightly larger brush, with a fine point, works for me.  There's also
a nice set of fine point markers in a graduated set called "SpotPen." 
Rather pricey, but convenient.
	At the micro level, any photographic image is made up of grain.  Change
the definition of grain slightly, and we could say that the image is
really made of "spots."  I'll call these "good spots."  What we see as a
"bad spot," is a clear area usually caused by the shadow of a dust speck
on or in the film emulsion.  What I try to do is match the light area of
the bad spot I'm spotting with the surrounding area's grain pattern.  I
do this by adjusting the dilution of the spotting color, and the load of
liquid in the brush, until I can make very tiny spots on the test paper
which more or less match the grain pattern of the area I'm spotting. 
Then I switch to the real print, and fill in the dust spot with a series
of light touches, each of which is intended to mimic a single grain.
	If the spot is a longish thread, I don't try to paint a streak.  I fill
it in with a series of spots, like pearls on a necklace (or genes on a
strand of DNA?)  If you fill in a "bad spot" with "good spots," which
match the surrounding grain pattern, you will see that bad spot
"disappear."
	I have done a bit of dry wall mudding and taping in my day, as well as
furniture refinishing.  There's a basic principle here: if you get very
close, and make it look good from a very close and intense inspection,
when you stand back and view from a normal perspective, it will look
very good.
	Larger format photographers may not have the large grain (I shoot
mostly 35mm, although I'm doing more and more medium format), so you are
matching tonality, but the pointillist approach still applies.

Darkroom notes:
	Since I swapped an Aristo cold light head for the condensers in my
Beseler 23C, I'm doing a lot less spotting.
	I have an exhaust fan behind my sink.  My air intake, on the wall
behind me, is a panel I made with two attic vents painted flat black,
and a furnace filter.  All the tray fumes are drawn away from me; all
the fresh air is filtered.  I run the fan when printing; I turn it off a
few minutes before hanging processed film.  When wet film is hung to
dry, I tiptoe out of the darkroom, and leave it in the quiet for a few
hours.  My final film rinse is End Run, by Sprint, made with distilled
water.
	I critically inspect prints in the fixer.  If I see dust spots, I try
to go back and clean the negative, and make another print.  First I try
to blow it off, then, if necessary, I brush it off, finally, I might use
a Q-tip and some emulsion cleaner.
	I don't use hardener in my fixer.  I've heard that can make your
spotting more difficult.  I don't use acid stop for film, as previously
posted in this thread. 
	"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
	Happy spotting.
	Phil

PS. Dust on the negative at the time of exposure, which gives you a
black spot, is a real curse.  I'll let someone else address that issue.

I have found APX100 a joy to use, it has a very good tone range and for my
developer I choose either Rodinal 1:50 or Refinal 1+1. I envy you guys in
America having easy access to Pyro, here in Australia we don't have an over
the counter product we can get. I have thought of staining a neg with food
dye one day just for the fun of it. APX100 is a very easy film to use as it
is a reasonably "old fashioned " formulation. I have recently started to use
a Jobo rotary system and with their recommended 5min pre wash the results
are great. I was sceptical about constant agitation but the results speak
for themselves. The thing I do like about the APX range is their consistency
throughout the formats. I use the film in 35mm, 6x6 and 5x4 both in the
studio and outdoors. Very little change in approach is required for either.
For me a rating of about 80 asa works well.

O.K. Tim,

This might be a good opportunity to inform our UK members of Arena's annual
weekend seminar. Don't take this as a spam - it is not a profit generating
event, just done for the pleasure it gives.

I attach a Press release I have just sent out. I'll include it as an
attachment in 'Word'

Ed,
As an Aussie but not wishing to go to war, from what reference point in
space do you assume "we" are "down under" and not vice versa. I simply ask

are down under, why do my negative fall to the floor and not the ceiling.

Hi, I've seen ads for this magazine,but I have never seen a copy of it.
Can anyone comment on its
quality and usefulness ?         Thanks, Harry

Hi Guys,
    Thanks to all that responded to my question.  Here is I think the =
answer I can best deal with.

<Here's what to do for part 'B.' Because you're mixing only ONE =
chemical, Kodalk, this will be <quite accurate. The Kodalk in part B =
occupies 16% of the total volume of the solution. Simply <start with 840 =
ml of distilled water and add enough Kodalk until the volume reaches =
1000 ml. <Some of the Kodalk will precipitate out, but nearly all will =
dissolve in a day or two. The Kodalk <that won't dissolve won't hurt =
anything. This is a saturated solution, in fact, a bit over saturated.

I plan to get a digital scale soon.  So, these little nagging questions =
won't continue to rear their ugly little heads as often.  There will be =
other little ugly little questions on other subjects I am sure. =20
As usual,
Lee Carmichael

I've just received an advertising brochure from INVERSNAID (Scotland)

The venues, content and tuition look fabulous.

Their address is =20
www.inversnaidphoto.com

My problem now is to arrange family, holiday and finance to
attend some of these events.

Secondly, I attended on of Barry Thornton's individual
tuition days last year.  Highly recommended.
His address is =20

I too would be interested to hear about "informal shooting
opportunities," especially in the Dublin area.  I've been
contemplating a trip there for a long weekend in late February or
early March for a combined photo and BEvERage safari of sorts.  I've
just been planning to pick up a Lonely Planet book or two and wander,
but any concrete suggestions for people, places, and/or things to
shoot would be welcome.

Thanks,

  Me too. I think the problem is that I despise doing it so much that I
don't give it the proper amount of patience.
  Anyway..I've had much better luck with the SpotPens than with the usual
SpotTone etc; I get better control with them. Also, sometimes a soft lead
pencil can work well.

Another question arises from the original post on Diactol [sic]...

Who is the jury? (I ask because unsubstantiated comments could be
commercially damaging, which could raise more questions in litigation.) If
Glyn is talking about the physical/chemical "effectiveness" of DiXactol
compared to other "tanning/staining" and "two-bath" developers then
everyone's milage may vary, not least depending on the pH of that commonest
of commodities "water" used in mixing the (or any) developer. But it is
interesting to point out that Gordon Hutchings, the modern reviver of PMK
pyro and a very fine photographer/printer/writer to whom many darkroom users
around the world will be eternaly thankful for his work on the subject, has
congratulated Barry Thornton for finding, and making work, a formulation
which he himself was trying to find for several years. The long-term work
that these (and other unsung) individuals undertake should not be dismissed
casually on heresay... many of us imagine we are searching for that Holy
Grail of darkroom processes, but we hardly scratch the surface in terms of
chemical investigation... we simply rely on others to do the dirty work and
provide the data... and lo and behold, we are amazed when it don't quite
work for us as well as we expected!

As to the comment, "Be safe, not sorry, and stick with the lovely Xtol ..."
*nothing* is safe, as has has been aired recently and *specifically* in Xtol
threads on the internet. As it happens, Xtol and DiXactol are, in general,
very fine developers... but everyone's printing style will not exploit their
advantages.

You just gave yourself away.  In the Northern hemisphere we use 4x5, not 5x4.

Lets see now:  Sodium Selenite is 45.66 percent Selenium and at a 1:19
dilution (keeping the math simple so I can keep my shoes on),

2% stock at 1:19 = 0.1% Sodium Selenite = 1000 ppm X 45.66% = 457 ppm Se.
for the fresh toner.  If about 50% of the Se is consumed, the Se = about
250 ppm in the used toner.  Combine this with the other volume of waste
water being generated in the darkroom (4L/min or so for the print washer
plus what else?) and you are to something like 50 ppm or less for a L (QT)
of used toner in the water going down the drain. Now dilute this by the
volume of water going into a sewer system.  Things can get down to low
concentrations really quick.  Are these concentrations really significant?
Y'all be the judge.  I see no point in tossing good toner from a one shot
process since it will keep to a certain extent.

One other suggestion before fighting the battle of an 8x10 enlarger - make
contact prints of the negatives using AZO wihch is the only contact paper
still available.  You can get it from either Calumet or Freestyle.  It is a
singe weight graded paper which has far more range than currently available
enlarging papers.  All you will need is a darkroom, a light source (an
overhead light bulb will work - that is what Edward Weston used), and a
contact frame or a sheet of glass.  The stuff is a cold toned paper and
selenium tones like a champ.     Best of luck.

I'm considering ditching the condenser head on my D2V and investing in the
aforementioned cold light setup. But one query: where do the filters go?  At
the moment I put 6 inch filters in the draw where the condensers go.  I
understand however that this part of the head disappears with the CL head.
Is this correct?  Would the CL head mean I have to use filters beneath the
lens?

Thanks in advance

Filters go beneath the lens.  I can understand concerns about the effect
on the image, but I have never seen any.  I did some prints through a
number 2 filter, and some with no filter.  I couldn't tell them apart. 
There is a similar debate about the effect of filters in front of the
taking lens, with no conclusive evidence of anything more than
additional flare potential.
	I noticed a big difference when I went from an old (25 years) Nikkor
lens to an APO Rodagon; I noticed a big difference with the Aristo swap;
I've never seen any difference from filters beneath the lens.  I also
know of several "master printers" in this area who use this technique.

Hi Carey -

I'd seriously look for a Chromega colorhead and power supply.  It gives you
all the same benefits of diffusion as the cold light and has built in
filtration.  They are going for cheap now since everyone is going digital.
I picked up a D3 with colorhead, cones, condensor head and carriers for 50
bucks (plus lots of sweat to refinish) and, more recently, an unused-like
new D4 and Chromega for $400.  Seek and ye shall find.

Maybe there is a cost issue but consider a color head for your printer. I
have had one on my medimum format omega and love it for the only type of
printing that I do <black and white>. It really works good for me in
providing a diffused light source. for my 35mm and 120 negs.

Hello,
My first posting, and it's a question... Don't feel to good about it... 
Anyway here's the question: has anybody out there in darkroomland adapted a 
color head to a Focomat IIc? WWOuld it be possible to fit somehow an 
Chromega or other available/affordable heads ?
I'm not too good with tools and adapting/modifiying things, so if there's 
is a solution not involving heavy transformations, it would be great.
Thank you for reading.

You seem to be doing this to make some money,  Spend the money to have copy
negs made up in size 4x5.  Then print to your hearts' content.  Or scan them

Where can I find one of these squeeze handle static eliminators?  I know 
years ago a company called Discwasher used to make something like that.. for 
eliminating a static charge on the old vinyl albums.  It was called the 
ZeroStat if I remember correctly.  I think it would be great for this use, 
but I can't seem to find any info on them.  Are they still made or is there 
something like them available?

I too have a big problem with dust.  I work in an unfinished basement, 
sharing it with the clothes washer and drier, and the central air/heating.  
Not good at all.  But since it isn't my house, I can't do anything as far as 
modifications to help.

<< Tim,
 
     I work in a darkroom with exposed lath & plaster ceilings & aging chalky
 walls. At times I have to take little chunks of plaster from chemistry when
 working.
 
     But, I have cut my spotting by about 90% with a few things that work for
 me.
 
     First, when I plug in the cold light head to warm up before a printing
 session, I turn on a big Honeywell HEPA air filtering machine. I let both
 run for a minimum of 20 minutes. This one alone has made a major difference
 in dust(or lack of it) in the printing process.
 
     When loading my film, I follow the same route & then wipe down holders
 lightly with either a damp sponge or lintless cloth(old diapers). This seems
 to do better than dust brushes for me as they only move dust around rather
 than removing it.
 
     I still get some dust on film but it is much less than before the filter
 & the damp cloth routine.
 
     One other area I used to mistake for dust on negs is in the use of stop
 bath-especially with TMax 100. If I use an acid stop bath, small pinholes I
 used to mistake for dust. Not a lot of them, but they are there. If I use
 water rinse only, they disappear & I am left just with the dust marks. I
 don't quite know why the pinholes with acid stop, even very weak stop, but
 when I tried it(on Ilford's suggestion) with just water the problem
 dissappeared.
 
     One other trick I found that works well for me is to carry one of the
 squeeze handle static eliminators and/or anti static spray in the car. Every
 now & then spray around the camera case and the dust problems 'seem' to be
 less. Maybe they aren't, but it seems so. I also use a damp towel once a day
 or so on the camera bag outside & then lightly inside as well.
 
     Since combining these methods my dust problem is much less. Now if
 someone has a foolproof system of getting rid of the dust entirely...

No list of workshops in the UK would be complete without mentioning DUCKSPOOL 
in Somerset. Set in the beautiful Quantock hills in a 16c farmhouse with 
interesting places to visit in all directions, Peter and Sue Goldfield run a 
variety of workshops  tutored by notable photographers- I have been to 
several and can't recommend them highly enough. They were challenging - but 
also highly enjoyable social occasions, and the food is fantastic!! See their 
website on www.duckspool.com to get the full flavour.

I have recently bought a Rollei TLR(2.8F) and find it a great camera,  but 
find the screen a bit dark in low light conditions, esp. at the edges. I can 
live with this but wondered if a brightscreen would be a help. I have heard 
the owner of a Hasselblad say they are great, and someone else say they make 
focussing difficult. As it would be expensive to buy-about Å£120- I would like 
to hear from anyone who has tried one, and which version --(split screen etc)

I bought one at a record store in Salt Lake City about two years ago. They
sell old records and had a few of them on a shelf. Try those places or
possibly Radio Shak.

I bought one for my original Hasselblad (a 500 C/M) and they come standard
with the newer cameras (501 C/M) - Hasselbad calls there screens 'Accutematte'.
They are very good and highly recommended...

before you buy a bright screen, try this.  I love tlr's and it has been my
experience that they are not sealed that well, so with some age dust accumulates
on the mirror.  So if you are the lease bit adventurous, remove the focusing
screen and hood assembly.  Get some canned air or better yet one of those squeeze
bulbs things that you use to mucus out of a babies nose and some kind of a very
soft brush.  Once you give it a good cleaning out, see if that helps you at all.
Since the mirror does not move like in a SLR, it in not that sensitive, but do
not beat on it either.  If this does not work you can always spend money later.

Not sure what you are trying to do here but have you might want to check
out an excellent book called 'Leica Darkroom Practice' written by
Rudolph Seck.  It is published by HOVE FOTO BOOKS in the UK (my
homeland) and is available here in the US.  Distributed by HP Books,
Tucson, AZ 85703.  ISBN 0 906447 24 0.  I think it costs about $20 or
so...

The book haslots of useful information on Leitz enlarging equipment
including some photographs of the Focomat IIc with various color heads.

Regards, Sylvia

There are several options, but a favorite among TLR users is the Maxwell
Brightscreen by Maxwell Precision Optics of Decatur, GA, USA
(770-934-0431).
	I replaced the screen in an old Rolleicord V (plain groundglass) with a
Maxwell screen, and the difference was astonishing.  It really opened up
the view, and made the camera a lot more useful.
	On the other hand, with my F model Rolleis, it makes far less
difference.  The Fs already have a fresnel style plastic screen.  After
replacing one screen, I haven't bothered to do the other.  I do suggest
the split image center spot, if you go this route.  It really helps in
low light.  Brighter screens can be harder to focus.  It's a paradox,
but the old coarse ground glass really shows when you're out of focus.
The bright screens look like you're looking through a window.
	You can take that present plastic screen out, and gently wash both
sides with warm water and dish detergent.  Be very careful with the
mirror, it's front surface.  Check out the rear element of the viewing
lens, it might have clouded up a bit.  On a cost/performance basis, with
an F, I might settle for a good cleaning as indicated: lens, mirror,
screen.  The Maxwell are a drop in with the F models, they cost about
$125.

Hi

Does anyone have any practical experience in comparing the Leitz V 35
Color module with the VARIOCONTAST module.  We use the Color module in
constant exposure time mode but at x14 enlargements it starts to get a
bit difficult to see the image on the paper for dodging and burning. 
Does the VARIOCONTAST module provide a brighter image ?  If so any ideas
on where to buy one at a reasonable price ?

On the other hand we keep thinking about medium format but are too
deeply into Leica kit ...

Thanks for the book reference. What I'd like to do is put a dichro 
colorhead on my enlarger. So I can use the Y and M filtrations when 
printing on VC paper. The Focomat IIc has a drawer aabove the condenser for 
filters, but it's not very practical when you want to use more than one 
filter (you know, using different grades for background and sky etc...). 
Sliding off and on the drawer just increase the chances of goofing.
Cheers.

  I found the Brightscreen in a Rollei to make focusing extremely difficult
in low light; it passes so much aerial image that it's like trying to focus
on window glass. Yes it's really bright and it works ok in bright light,
but that's when you least need it.
  Marflex in NJ, USA, is selling a bright replacement screen for the F
Rolleis that Martin says is closer to an Acute-Matte or Rollei Hi-D type
than the Beattie or Brightscreens. I understood he was getting them in some
sort of connection with Ian Parker but I have no idea if that's correct.
You might call him at 973-808-9626 for information, and he may know of
other sources for the same screen.

  The Hasselblad Acute Matte screens are Minolta inventions, actually, and
are very bright while still retaining lots of contrast. Rollei's Hi-D
screens for the 6000 series are the same thing.
  Unfortunately the Rollei 6000 screens will not fit the F TLR; those
screens are a little bigger.

  BTW, the screen I recommend _against_ is NOT the Maxwell screen; I don't
know anything about that one. I was referring to the Brightscreen made by
Brightscreen of Cleveland, Tenn.

Pam,
If you already know if you want a field or monorail camera, maybe you can 
check the manufacturers web sites: Toyo, Linhof, Wisner, Wista etc... They 
usually post the specs with pix.

I would suggest you go to http://www.thefstop.com/menu.html where they have 
a lot of direct links to manufacturers, plus other goodies (focal 
conversion table for different format, etc...)

I recommend in favor of the Maxwell screen.. for a 3.5E Rollei.
(Though since this is really helping out the Heidsomat viewing lens
there should be no difference for 2.8F Rolleis.)  I find it to be
useful in light so low that it would be difficult to even frame
the picture without it.  I agree with John H. that it makes focusing
slightly less precise (in all circumstances). On the other hand
it makes the image far brighter, especially in the dark corners.

The fresnel screen that you can drop in on top of the existing
ground glass is far far inferior.

I am slightly concerned that the focus location may shift with
the alternative screen; I fiddled with putting in some thin
shims, but now I'm not sure it is necessary.

Luc,

The Focomat IIC instruction book doesn't list any adaptor plate for other
heads... but I know that the Ilford Multigrade system *does* have an adaptor
for the IIC. However, the old Ilford 400 system, which you may find on the
second-hand market going *cheap* will not give correct readings with
Ilford's recent MG IV papers, which is why they came up with a 500 system.
The Ilford 500H Multigrade head can be fitted to the IIC... but strangely
the Ilford brochure indicates the 500H "diffuser" as only covering 6x7cm
whilst the 500H "condenser" covers 6x9cm.

I'm sure that Omega woul dhave made an adaptor for the IIC as well.

OK, now I understand.  FYI, the FOCOMAT IIc was available with other
heads like the Durst Color Head CLS 450 and the Chromega Color Head
Super Chromega D.  Pictures of this are in the book although no real
details beyond that.  I still recommend the book though for a very good
read.  You are lucky to have such a fine enlarger :-)

Do we actually need a formal workshop? Pure-silver members surely have a
fair bit of know-how between them. How about just hiring a minibus for
week or so, fill it up with pure-silver members, cameras, tripods, films,
and whatnots and just go off into the Scottish west coast or highlands?

Hello all,

I have just completed the first stage of my
calibration of TMX in XTOL 1:1. I shot 4 zone 1
exposures at 50, 64, 80, and 100 and got 4 densities
pretty much evenly scaled. Now one of those densities
is going to be closest to 0.10 over FB+F. The problem
is this: the densitometer I was going to use was
damaged in a fire at the medical school lab. I do have
a calibrated film strip from Kodak which ranges from
0.02 to 4.5 in about 0.20 steps. Has anyone tried
scanning the film strip and their film on a flat bed
transparency scanner and tried to plot out the
calibrated values and then placed their film on the
plot to get a density? Can you use a scanner as a
densitometer? I'll eventually be doing my Zone VIII
exposures with variable development times as well, so
this is one aspect I'll need to work out. Thanks.

  I bought an Aristo cold light head for my D2v some years ago. After
experimenting with it for a time I went back to the condenser system.
  I found that when the enlarger was _carfully_ aligned the uniformity of
illumination with the condensers was actually better than with the cold
light head and intensity was greater for 35mm. I do notice a great
improvement in reducing blemishes on negatives. Dusty negs will print with
dust spots with either system. 
  I also found that there was virtually no difference in print quality. I
simply stopped using the cold light head after a while. Its in its box on
the shelf, don't think I've pulled it out for a year.
  In fact, the condenser sources on Omega, and most other common enlargers,
are partially diffusing. The opal lamp forms a large, diffuse surface,
which is imaged onto the lens. True point source lamps are available but
are used only for special purposes. They will greatly exagerate blemishes
but are sharper than other sources. The difference in the amount of
diffusion between an Omega type condenser source, and a diffusing source is
not as great as is sometimes suggested.
  If you want a good diffused source I must agree with others that a color
head is a better choice.

Hi Richard -

Before I read who wrote this post, I was amazed at just how well written and
informative it was.  I agree with your findings 100%. I was, however, amazed
to hear of the eveness of illumination the condenser head gave.  I do have a
variable condenser set for Omegas but have never used it on either my D3 or
4, opting instead to use the chromegas.  I might, perhaps, now that I know
better, try it on my D3 which is set up to handle mural-size prints.

Thanks for always being there with such good advice.

Regards,
Curt

  There is some suppression of blemishes. However, when negatives which
have been developed for condenser printing are used the next grade harder
paper must be used for the same contrast. The greater paper contrast tends
to pick up the blemishes again. Similarly, when the higher contrast negs
required for diffusion printing are used with the condenser, lower contrast
paper is used, which tends to suppress the blemishes. The suppression of
blemishes is dependant on the negatives being developed so that they print
on the same grade paper in the two systems.
  The contrast change between condenser and diffusion heads will depend on
the emulsion. Thick, relatively coarse-grain emulsions tend to have a lot
of Callier effect, thin emulsion, very fine grain films have less. Color
film has virtually none. On average, for B&W silver films the difference
will be about one paper grade.
 The lack of Callier effect with color film means that the suppression of
blemishes of color film with a diffusion head will be more consistent than
for B&W film.

  A simple drop-in fresnel lens like the old Rolleigrid will help. From
comments on the Rollei Users Group list the Maxwell screen seems to be the
best of the aftermarket screens which completely replace the original
ground glass. These are made and installed by Bill Maxwell, who I believe
is in Fla. He is also supposed to be a first-class Rollei tech.

I put a Beattie Intenscreen in an older Rolleiflex, and the difference is like
night and day.  I have no trouble focusing, and it's nice to be able to see the
entire square.  I wish I could afford to put them in all my Rolleiflexes.
I got it from B&H for $120.  You can install it in 5 minutes if you have a small,
jeweler's screw driver.

Dear Group,

I am very new to this group.  It is really great.  One technical
e-mail question:  Is it possible to have the e-mail program that
forwards these e-mails put "PS:" and then the subject the author orginally
wrote?

That way, I can create a filter in my e-mail program to automatically
put these e-mails in a folder that I can read at my leasure (I have a
disease of always having to read my in-box when the bell rings; sort
of like Pavlov's dog).

I like to follow the threads, but there are so many messages coming into my
in-box.

Is that possible or am I just being a weenie?

  You should be able to create mailbox filters without anyting special
being added to the messages. Messages sent from Pure Silver will have
pure-silver@tundraware.com in the reply to field and from field. These can
be used to filter incoming messages. Similarly messages sent to the list
will have the address of the list in the To: field which can be used to
filer messages to an outgoing mailbox. 
  I subscribe to several mailing lists and filter each to a separate
mailbox with separate boxes for incoming and outgoing messages.
  I can't tell from the headers what kind of mail program you use but if it
has the capability of filtering you should be able to set filters up
without anything being added to the messages.

Thanks richard, you are entirely correct.  It was too late when I wrote
this.

Thanks for everything that I have learned about photography from your posts.

I have a V35 with a variocontrast module. Its only used for B/W and works
perfectly. Very simple to dial in the grade you want & change grades while
dodging & burning with no chance of upsetting anything. Be warned that it
does not work well with 35mm negs dev'd in Pyro. It appears that there is
some kind of built in neutral density filters (I presume to keep the times
constant) that clash with the colour of the stained neg & stop predictable
changes in grades. Apart from that it is a great piece of equipment. Long
live Lecia.

It has been great to have so many people give their thoughts and suggestions 
on the question of a brightscreen for the Rollei--the mirror has been dusted, 
the present screen carefully washed and viewing lens inspected --I shall not 
rush to get a new screen, but will look out at Photographica in London in 
May(?) in the hopes of a 2nd hand one, and meantime see if I get more 
accustomed to the present screen. ( Also keeping my own glasses clean might 
help !) Thanks everyone--regards, Saffron.From ???@??? Tue Feb  1 13:11:56 2000

Hello All,

I am trying to find some information regarding reversal processing of Tech.
Pan. as a first stage to producing enlarged negatives for alt. printing. I
understand that a Kodak kit is available but it gives transparencies
suitable for  reproduction of line artwork. Is this correct or can the
process be modified to produce c/t positives. I have been making my
interpos' on  Ilford XP-2 but they  lack the definition I require to
produce enlarged negs. from as the film is dye coupler based, and has to be
C41 processed thus cutting out any degree of fine contrast control via
development.

Any thoughts on the subject would be appreciated.

Many thanks in advance,

Julian Smart.

BTW, Tim Rudman, if you are reading- many thanks for your input re Lith
printing. your book is superb  and I am now getting predictable results!

I have been using an Aristo head with V-54 tubes on 5x7 (with filters below
the lens) with out problems.  I think that Aristo makes a VC (2 tube) head
for Omega which would eliminate the filter concern.  If you are considering
a VC head, also check-out the Zone VI VC head for Omega D series.  That is
what I used to replace the condenser head on my D-2V and think it is great.
Separate controls for the low and high contrans tubes along with an
intensity stabilizer built in.

To echo a few of Tim's comments, Chuck does give a durn good workshop.  I
have attended his  Zion, Lone Pine and last years DV workshops.  The DV
workshop is designed for the more advanced photographer (large format or
otherwise) and it focuses more on the creative aspects of creating an image.
It is assumed that you will be proficient in the operation of your camera,
know how to expose film, select filters etc.  Last years workshop had
several working professionals there and it made for many interesting and
informative discussions.  Death Valley is also an interesting and unusual
place to photograph.  Also it is a geologist's field day ( or gigantic jumble).

Just for information, both heads are made by Aristo.  It is just that the Zone VI
has provisions for the probe.
