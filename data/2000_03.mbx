During the 1970s I used a lot of Diafine two bath developer, and got very
good results with the then FP4 and Tri-X in medium format.
There doesn't seem to be a source of supply in the UK any more. Does anybody
know from where I can get some?
Also, I would appreciate views on this developer which I have often thought
must be simply a two bath version of Acufine from the same maker.

I had a romance once with Diafine, but she was too passionate.  Dense,
contrasty negatives.  We had to stop meeting like that.  Later, friends
told me that less exposure, and less time in the first bath would have
helped.
	The years went by, I'm now happily married to Xtol (a real goddess.)

I'm not au fait with the M6 but doesn't it have TTL metering?  That would
be an indication of the cap's presence!

Diafine (and Acufine) are alive and well and living in a Chicago suburb.

Brandess-Kalt-Aetna
701 Corporate Woods Parkway
Vernon Hills, IL 60061  USA

www.bkaphoto.com

BKA sell direct, but Calumet is cheaper (though perhaps not cheaper than 
home made).

Just mixed a fresh bath of Acufine for a roll of FP4+.  It came out much 
denser than another FP4+ shot under the same conditions and developed in 
Xtol.  May get to printing them this weekend.  Will post if anything 
interesting turns up.

So....anybody know exactly what is in each of those little packages in XTOL?
Should be a way to do a "split" XTOL developer...Johnny Deadman(Brownlow) uses a
modified split technique with Xtol...

A while back I posted a review of my shiny new Zi to the pure-silver
mailing list and net news.  Here's a brief follow-up.

A couple weeks ago I had to go to Singapore on business.  I knew I'd have
very limited time for pix - turned out to be about 6 hours over 7
days (;  I brought a digital camera for the tourist stuff, and I didn't
want to haul a bunch of heavy equipment around for the "real" pix -
this precluded a view camera or MF SLR... so, I took the Zi loaded
with my usual Agfapan APX 100 for later development in PMK pyro.

I just printed 4 of the images I took there and the results at
11x14 are just stunning - the images are contrasty, tack sharp
and the tonal rendering is first-rate. Even the handheld stuff holds
up beautifully.  

I said it before and I'll say it again - under VERY critical
examination, I can see slight degradation when compared with
images taken with my Hasselblad, but the differences are really, really,
small.  If I didn't need the interchangeable lenses, I'd get rid of
the 'Blad and use the Zi for all things rollfilm.

I highly endorse this camera.  It takes a bit of getting used to, but
if you want a "rollfilm Leica" that doesn't cost the sun, moon, and
stars (like a Mamiya 7) this camera is it.  I have already recommended
it to a number of less serious photographers as a general purpose
point-n-shoot if they want spectacular family, holiday, and vacation
photos.

Yes, you are right.  When there is no or shall we say insufficient
light, as in the case of the lens cap being left on, one of the fancy
red LED arrow shaped lights blinks like crazy to let you know there is a
problem.  Remove lens cap and WYSIWYG is restored !

Sylvia

Mike;<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>The
formula for XTOL is in <i>The Film Developing Cookbook</i> by Stephen
Anchell and Bill Troop, published by Focal Press. Kodak's patent lists a
few chemical that are not easily available, so mixing up the exact XTOL
formula would be very difficult. In that book there is another formula,
MYTOL, which I composed using more commonly available chemicals. So, you
can mixed up your own substitute XTOL. MYTOL's working characteristics,
development times and grain structure are very similar to XTOL. I don't
think it has the shelf life that is claimed by XTOL...but I wouldn't
leave a developer stock solution on the shelf for a year, and then try
and use it. You only have one opportunity to develop a film, so why risk
it with old solutions. One of the advantages of mixing your own
developers from scratch, is that you can make up what you need, and not
be limited to the sizes that the manufacturers package for you.<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>XTOL uses
Sodium Isoascorbate (an ascorbic acid sodium derivative) and Phenidone as
it's two developing agents. I have tried to come up with a satisfactory
two bath developer using Sodium Ascorbate and Phenidone, as well as
Sodium Ascorbate and Metol...without success...so far. (Sodium Ascorbate
is functionally very similar to Sodium Isoascorbate, but is much more
easily available. You can buy it at Health Food stores.)<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>So Mike, I
hope that answers your questions. If you don't already have it, you
should get a copy of <i>The Film Developing Cookbook</i>. It will explain
a lot about film developers and dispel quite a few myths. If you are also
interested in mixing your own developers, for film and paper, check out
Steve Anchell's <i>The Darkroom Cookbook</i>, also published by Focal
Press.<br>

  The contents of Xtol are listed in its MSDS. Kodak has current MSDS for
all its products on its web site at: http://www.kodak.com  This site was
recently redesigned, I find it much easier to navigate than the old one.
For MSDS click on Tips and Techniques on the home page and from there on MSDS.
  I don't think there is any practical method for splitting the two
packages up. Once open Part A, which contains the Phenidone, is likely to
oxidize very quickly.
  Xtol actually looks like buffered D-76 with Phenidone taking the place of
Metol and Iso-ascorbic acid replacing the Hydroquinone.

Tim,
I am new to this list so I hope I will get it right:

<<  I took the Zi loaded
 with my usual Agfapan APX 100 for later development in PMK pyro. >>

I have struggled with PMK Pyro for a while, would be helpful to get your 
experience.

I have Gordon Hutchings book where he suggests Agfa Roll film at EI 100 and 
11 min development vs. 13 min for other (sheet) film sizes at EI 80. His EI 
were calibrated with a Zone VI modified spot meter and he recommends 
decreasing all speeds about 2/3 stop when using standard meters, i.e. AGFA 
APX 100 with normal meters at EI 64.
Furthermore, he recommends trying Delta 400 with 11 minutes and EI 200 with a 
normal meter. All times at 70F.

Some suppliers have taken his times for sheet film and EI for modified meters 
as recommendations for 35 mm and roll film.

As your Fuji has a "normal" meter, please advise what EI and development time 
you use for APX 100.
Do you use JOBO, if so at high or low speed?
If small tank, what agitation procedure?
Do you use any pre-soak? (which I never use for JOBO, have never had any 
problems)
Do you have any times for +1 and -1 developments? Any speed changes with -1 
development?
For how long time do you after bath the film in the used developer? I have 
tried 4 minutes at low speed recently in order to get a more pronounced stain.

Do you, or anyone else reading this, have experience from Delta 400  Pro that 
they want to share?

Best regards,

Jan O. Edman
Toulaud, France

Barry, Jan and group,

Several months ago I got the recommendation from someone on the list to try 
DP400 in PMK.  I was looking for something (in 35mm) sharper and finer-grained 
than HP5+.  So I tried it and have been amazed ever since.  In my experience, I 
find the film is noticeably finer-grained than HP5+, the stain is much deeper, 
the highlights much creamier and more differentiated and the film just as 
sharp.  I also find it to be about a half-stop faster than HP5+. I find it sort 
of like getting the grain of FP4+ (without the high contrast you sometimes get 
with FP4+) with the speed of the 400 speed films.  Mind you, this is 35mm.  I'm 
still using FP4+ and HP5+ (in PMK) in 120 and 4x5.  For 35mm, I need as 
much "performance" as I can get from my late-generation Leica Asph lenses and 
DP400 really shines.

Regards,
Curt

Tim -

Are you absolutely sure your water supply makes a difference.  A couple of 
years ago I had similar variability problem with PMK (and shoudn't have because 
there is adequate buffering in PMK).  What I thought was a water quality issue 
turned out to be a problem batch of Part B - the sodium metaborate.  I had a 
batch that had about 1/2 the amount of dissolved chemical.  Once we traced it 
to that there were never any more problems with variability.  I can mix pmk up 
in virtually any water supply and get consistent results.  Were I to limit 
myself to distilled water, I'd go broke buying water.  The chitry for a liter 
of PMK costs me  9 cents while the water would cost 25 cents!  And I use a lot 
of this stuff.

The other potential problem with the part B is oxidation.  Masny have reported 
the stuff becomes oxidized in fairly short order - 2 to 6 months and they make 
up new.

Whenever I hear of PMK problems, the issues with part b are usually a part, if 
not all, of the problem.

Curt

Jan
When I was unkind about the original Delta 400 in my book 'Elements', Ilford
asked me to field test Delta 400 Pro before they released it. It was a
significant improvement over the original in terms of its shadow detail. For
a period I did move to it from my long-time lover, HP5 Plus out of loyalty
to Ilford for whom I give occasional Masterclasses, but I never found it a
satisfying film.
It is very slightly finer grain than HP5 Plus, but it is marginal, and not
really visible in medium format. However, it does look much less sharp than
HP5 Plus, and its tones just don't seem so bright. No matter what developer
I used with it, or the dilution used, or the paper on to which I printed,
there just wasn't that sparkle in the image. I didn't like the heavily
tinted film base, peculiarly unlike Delta 100, that made judging the
negatives more difficult.
At the same time I was running experiments with PMK, and later with my own
tanning/staining developer, and soon realised the truth of Gordon Hutchings'
praise for HP5 Plus in PMK was fully justified. It tans and stains better
than any other major brand film, and its sharpness is startling. Not only
that, its bright tonality, especially when printed on to a graded paper, is
beautiful.
Generally, I find Gordon Hutchings' times for development for roll film in
the Book of Pyro way over the top. For instance, my N time for 120 HP5 Plus
in PMK is 8 minutes for printing on grade2 Ilfospeed through the diffuser VC
head on my Meopta Magnifax enlarger. (The same as my time in single bath Di
Xactol). For 35mm FP4 Plus in PMK my N time is 7 minutes. 120 TMX comes in
at 81/2 minutes. Gordon's times may be over the top to cope with the lowered
contrast of Ilford Multigrade VI , and the softening of contrast its yellow
stain gives on VC papers.
Delta 400 Pro does not respond well to staining. It is much less than HP5
Plus or Tri-X, or FP4 Plus.
I think it would be true to say that most 'conventional' films respond
better to PMK stain than tabular or delta grain films. Agfa APX films are an
exception. They tan well but there is virtually no stain, and that removes a
lot of the advantage of PMK I feel. APX 100 in medium format is fine grain
enough, though, for the lack of grain masking by the stain not to count too
much.
In the end, how a film looks is a personal taste choice, but I hope my views
help.

Tim,
I am new to this list so I hope I will get it right:

<<  I took the Zi loaded
 with my usual Agfapan APX 100 for later development in PMK pyro. >>

I have struggled with PMK Pyro for a while, would be helpful to get your
experience.

I have Gordon Hutchings book where he suggests Agfa Roll film at EI 100 and
11 min development vs. 13 min for other (sheet) film sizes at EI 80. His EI
were calibrated with a Zone VI modified spot meter and he recommends
decreasing all speeds about 2/3 stop when using standard meters, i.e. AGFA
APX 100 with normal meters at EI 64.
Furthermore, he recommends trying Delta 400 with 11 minutes and EI 200 with
a
normal meter. All times at 70F.

Some suppliers have taken his times for sheet film and EI for modified
meters
as recommendations for 35 mm and roll film.

As your Fuji has a "normal" meter, please advise what EI and development
time
you use for APX 100.
Do you use JOBO, if so at high or low speed?
If small tank, what agitation procedure?
Do you use any pre-soak? (which I never use for JOBO, have never had any
problems)
Do you have any times for +1 and -1 developments? Any speed changes with -1
development?
For how long time do you after bath the film in the used developer? I have
tried 4 minutes at low speed recently in order to get a more pronounced
stain.

Do you, or anyone else reading this, have experience from Delta 400  Pro
that
they want to share?

Best regards,

Your comments on films are appreciated.  We had come to the same
conclusion that INOHO, HP5 was the way to go for a faster film.  Your
tests were probably a lot more scientific than ours though.

What would you view be on a slower film for 35mm ?  We tried Tmax but
can't really get on with it reliably.  We very much like APX-100 but
it's too grainy and find FP4 not overly sharp.  We are currently
playing with PANF and Delta 100.  We also have a stack of APX-25 in the
fridge but don't always use a tripod (yes, I know we should.)  After
trying lots of developers, have come back to ID11 but now that we know
where to buy your developer in the USA will try that soon.

Regards

I use an EI of 50 and develop for 11 min @ 68 degrees F

I use an open, 1 gal tank (with nitrile rubber gloves as well as glasses to
avoid splash and contact problems with the pyro) and agitate every 15 seconds for
5 seconds.

Yes, 1 minute in normal tap water

Keep in mind that contraction should not be as necessary w/pyro because it naturally
reduces contrast in the highlights - a 'normal' pyro neg should hold its own
witth as much as 14 stops of range in the subject matter.  On those rare occasions that
I need contraction, I need a LOT of it, so I use and EI of 32 and development time of
7 1/2 min - subjectively, I'd put this at about N-3, but I've never actually measured it.

One last thing - I have discovered that water makes a lot more difference than most people
realize.  I have seen up to one full stop in variability as my water changes throughout
the year.  Thus, I now only used distilled water for mixing all developers.  The times
noted above are for PMK Pyro mixed in distilled water.

Here's how I do it:

1) Hang wet print by one corner to drip dry for about 10 minutes
2) Dry face-up on a drying screen overnight
3) Flatten dry print in a dry mounting press

Works like a charm...

Nope - the variability was observed with HC-110 not PMK...

This does surprise me, especially the comment about more stain and speed
with DP than HP5 Plus-  exactly the opposite of what I found. Time for me to
re-examine the film I think. Maybe we have had another manufacturer's
unannounced emulsion change. I'll get to work.

Barry, Jan and group,

Several months ago I got the recommendation from someone on the list to try
DP400 in PMK.  I was looking for something (in 35mm) sharper and
finer-grained
than HP5+.  So I tried it and have been amazed ever since.  In my
experience, I
find the film is noticeably finer-grained than HP5+, the stain is much
deeper,
the highlights much creamier and more differentiated and the film just as
sharp.  I also find it to be about a half-stop faster than HP5+. I find it
sort
of like getting the grain of FP4+ (without the high contrast you sometimes
get
with FP4+) with the speed of the 400 speed films.  Mind you, this is 35mm.
I'm
still using FP4+ and HP5+ (in PMK) in 120 and 4x5.  For 35mm, I need as
much "performance" as I can get from my late-generation Leica Asph lenses
and
DP400 really shines.

Curt

Surprised you find FP4 lacking in sharpness. Edge effects are one of its
strengths. For slow films, other than document films, the choice really
seems to be between Pan F and APX25. I love APX in Perceptol (same as
Microdol X) 1:3 - a nice blend of smooth fine grain graduation and edge
sharpness. For more aggressive sharpness, try Pan F in my Di Xactol in its
single bath guise. Around 7 minutes is right for printing on graded paper (I
always use Ilfospeed grade 2 as my standard). I have a demonstration picture
which I show at seminars of a vintage motorcycle engine using 35mm Pan F in
Di Xactol where under the focus magnifier, the surface finish of the grain
of the polished metal is clearly visible. Obviously grain isn't as fine as
APX in this combination.
Delta 100 and TMX actually give grain only fractionally coarser than APX25,
but their apparent sharpness is not as great. Delta is by far the more
tolerant of the two, but I have been getting some beautiful TMX medium
format negs in Di Xactol because it controls that film's tendency to
bullet-proof highlights. I have a TMX picture in my next book of a backlit
misty melting sky over a Scottish loch which would have been virtually
unprintable with conventional development. There is a tiny fishing boat on
the loch which is etching sharp too. But this is 120, not 35mm.

Your comments on films are appreciated.  We had come to the same
conclusion that INOHO, HP5 was the way to go for a faster film.  Your
tests were probably a lot more scientific than ours though.

What would you view be on a slower film for 35mm ?  We tried Tmax but
can't really get on with it reliably.  We very much like APX-100 but
it's too grainy and find FP4 not overly sharp.  We are currently
playing with PANF and Delta 100.  We also have a stack of APX-25 in the
fridge but don't always use a tripod (yes, I know we should.)  After
trying lots of developers, have come back to ID11 but now that we know
where to buy your developer in the USA will try that soon.

  Although Delta 400's curve shapes are about the same as HP5+ in many
developers it does look odd.

  I think I found what's so different; it has somewhat less red sensitivity
than HP5+, which really shows with caucasian skin tones.

Here's how I do it:

1) Hang wet print by one corner to drip dry for about 10 minutes
2) Dry face-up on a drying screen overnight
3) Flatten dry print in a dry mounting press

Works like a charm...

No way - the emulsion is soft when wet - a squeegee is a good way to trash
the print surface.  Hanging them up to drip dry for 5 or 10 minutes accomplishes
the same thing with no violence to the print.

A comment on this one. It varies with your water quality and filtration. In
our area with very hard water, fail to squeegee carefully and you have a

A comment on this one. It varies with your water quality and filtration. In
our area with very hard water, fail to squeegee carefully and you have a
nice ring of mineral deposits on the print. Soak in the purified or
distilled water before drying to get rid of that problem, but refine your
squeegee technique & possibly the rubber windshield wiper/bathroom squeegee
you use and you can most likely get rid of any surface scratching problems.

I use the squeege thing and never have a bit of trouble disturbing any of the 
fiber of the prints...I find my prints dry so much better with as little 
water in them.  I lay them flat on plastic screen to dry then finish them up 
under a Seal heat press (dry mount press) that I bought in a yard sale for 75 
cents!!!

I suppose you can use a clothes iron...place some release paper or kraft 
paper around the print first,I would imagine to get them flat...

The Kodak MSDS for XTOL is good enough for the lawyers but not much help
to understand the formula. Here is Kodak's patent formula...not to say
they don't change it when they manufacture it...as they are rumored to do
with D-76.<br>
<br>
Kodak XTOL US Patent 5,756,271 (1998)<br>
<br>
Part A:<br>
Sodium sulfite
anhydrous&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

12 g<br>
<br>
Add Part A to 750 ml of water at room temperature;<br>
follow with Part B and water to make 1 liter.<br>
<br>
Silvia Zawadzki, XTOL's creator, differentiated it from earlier published
formulae by:<br>
1. The use of 4-hydroxymethyl-4-methyl-1-phenyl-3-pyrazolidone instead of
plain Phenidone. There is a general consensus among researchers that this
is the preferred form of Phenidone.<br>
2. The use of sodium isoascorbate, a vitamin C derivative, instead of
hydroquinone. This seems to eliminate some of the unpredictablities in PQ
developers over the years. It is not as strong a combination as PQ, but
seems more desirable from the standpoint of image quality.<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>In earlier
literature, it has been suggested that ascorbic acid, like hydroquinone,
is almost inactive under pH 9. Its primary use in XTOL would seem to be
to active and regenerate the Phenidone. But Zawadzki believes that the
ascorbate is the primary developing agent in XTOL.<br>
3. XTOL is the first viable ascorbate developer formulated to work at a
pH as low as 8.2. Ascorbate has been characterized as a very
&quot;sharp&quot;, surface-acting developer. That, in combination with
low pH, results in negatives that achieve a better speed/grain/sharpness
relationship than is possible with traditional developing agents.<br>
4. A significant feature of this developer is that it is intended to be
mixed at room temperature.<br>
<br>
That is a part of the discussion about XTOL in <i>The Film Developing
Cookbook.<br>
<br>
</i>....and that really is pentaacetic!! <br>
<br>
Chemistry aside, a developer is only useful if it gives you the image
qualities that you want. I prefer XTOL 1+2 ... actually I use Mytol 1+2
... for my general purpose developer. I find it definitely superior to
D-76/ID-11.<br>

Ever since my old ferrotyping days, I have always squeegeed my prints on the 
back.  I no longer use the ferrotype sheets, but I squeegee on a 1/4" sheet 
of super-smooth Lexan (I'm sure any very smooth surface would do).  I 
squeegee in all 4 directions and then dry it in various ways, depending on 
the size and nature of the paper.  The emulsion-side never gets any stroking, 
gentle or otherwise.

I use a variety of fiber papers (  Oriental, Bergger, Agfa and Ilford) 
and squeegee them all face down- then face up  then lay them face down on 
drying screens. 
I don't have any emulsion damage problems but realize that my fixing 
procedure  involves ZoneVI fix for the first bath and pure hypo for the 
second. The first fix comes with  small amount of  hardener in it but not 
as much hardener as Kodak fixer.
The hardener does toughen up the emulsion to withstand surface abrasion.
After they are dry I leave them overnight in a Zone VI print flattener 
and that works well.
Some of my commercial clients request that I run all the prints through 
the dry mount press for ultimate flatness.

As a side note the glass I use is for squeegeeing is from the side window 
of a 57 chevy- safer than regular glass stiffer than plexi  and has old 
car cache' to boot.

I started using Xtol shortly after it came out, and noticed a
significant gain in film speed over the previous developer I was using
(D76) - TMX jumped from 64 to 100 - with better shadow contrast. The
increase in speed was true, with no loss in shadow detail.

I percieve that the grain is finer - I shoot 4x5 for I can;t really
comment on the sharpness. Holding the highlights is easier than with
D76, but again, that is a perception, not a scientific finding.

Dan;<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>The points
that I quoted were from both Silvia Zawadzki and Kodak literature, I
believe. She is justifably proud of XTOL. It was an idea which flew in
the face of commonly held professional opinions and historical
research.<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Phil Davis
did an article, <i>Kodak Xtol Film Developer</i> in the Nov/Dec 1996
issue of&nbsp; PHOTO Techniques. He seemed to like it. He ended the
article with this: &quot;Photographers who are fond of D-76 will be
pleased to discover that Xtol generally produces of very similar
gradation, but with the added advantage of a modest increase in effective
film speed and (according to the documentation) better grain and
sharpness. In every respect this new developer appeared to do a fine job
on all the films I processed in it. If it is marketed at a competitive
price, it should have wide appeal.&quot;<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Dick
Dickerson and Silvia Zawadzki wrote an interesting article, <i>The
Genesis of Xtol</i> in the Sept/Oct 1999 issue of PHOTO Techniques that
explored the&nbsp; DQE (Detective Quantum Efficiency) of different
developers. DQE quantifies speed,graininess, sharpness and contrast for a
developer. Individual qualities can be improved, but the total volume of
those factors cannot be exceeded. They said that, as a class Ascorbic
Acid based developers exceeded the DQE of Hydroquinone developers. So,
XTOL should, by those standards be capable of better quality negs than a
developer like D-76/ID-11.<br>
<x-tab>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</x-tab>Ctein
wrote a two part article in issue no. 25 and 26 (1996) of <i>Darkroom
User</i>, when XTOL was just being introduced. That's Ed Buziak's
magazine, now called <i>camera &amp; darkroom</i>. Ctein's opinion was:
&quot;After my own exhaustive testing, (which will be reported over the
next two issues of DU) I've been able to confirm Kodak's remarkable
claims. With just about every film I've tested, MX1620, now known as
Kodak Xtol developer, produces results as good as or better than D-76.
One does not see all the improvements with every film, nor does Kodak
claim one will, But in no case does Xtol (pronounced &quot;ex-tol&quot;
woth a short &quot;o&quot;) produce worse results.&quot; ...and when
Ctein says exhaustive testing, he really means exhaustive testing!<br>
<br>
For all the testing and articles that are written, it only matters if you
are happy with the negs a developer produces. <br>

  The patent literature is interesting to read. One must be careful of the
language of patents and the purpose. Along with the discussion of how the
developer works you will find the usual attemp to broaden out the claims as
much as possible.
  The MSDS suggests that packaged Xtol is pretty nearly identical with the
formula given in the patent.
  It contains, as indicated above, two superadditive developing agents,
namely a form of Phenidone and iso-ascorbic acid, a buffered alkali, namely
a borax and boric acid mixture, as used in D-76, and a sequestering agent,
namely EDTA, penta-sodium salt.
  This last is probably to complex impurities in the water but may have
oher effects since it will also complex free silver.
  The form of Phenidone used is a Kodak proprietary form sold by them as
"Dimezone".
  The patent is available on line from either the US Patent and Trade Mark
Office or the IBM intellectual property site.
  It is worth looking at the cited references.
  Note that D-76 uses two reducing agents, Metol and Hydroquinone, which
are highly superadditive. Hydroquinone is inactive as a reducing agent at
the relativly low pH of D-76. Its activity is in regenerating the reaction
products of Metol back into metol. This considerably extends the life of
the developer but also has some effect on the kinetics of development since
it tends to limit developer local exhaustion effects. The same is likely
true of Xtol. Those who like lots of edge effects will probably do better
with developers with a single reducing agent, or at a combination which is
not superadditive. 
Kodak D-23, for example, has nearly the same activity as D-76 but contains
only Metol. D-23 is more likely to produce a shoulder or compressed
highlight contrast than D-76 in similar dilutions. Carlton and Crabtree in
their 1929 paper describing the buffered version of D-76 show the results
of perhaps twenty variations of the formula. Among those were a couple
without the Hydroquinone. In fresh developer the density and gamma were
virtually identical. The Hydroquinone formula extends the life of the
developer so is desirable.
  I don't think there is any perfect developer; some users like the
imperfections of some developers, i.e. the grain and local effects of
diluted Rodinal. OTOH, Xtol seems to have a good balance of desirable
characteristics.

  In my post just now I realize I made two errors. One was to refer to a
Borax and Boric acid buffer in Xtol. It isn't. Xtol contains Kodalk (Sodium
Metaborate) and a buffer of sulfite and metabisulfite. Current D-76 uses
the Borax-boric acid buffer. There is still a great similarity in the two.

I cant remember if I already sent this here or not; I was going to comment
on Dimezone either here or r.p.d before I left town for a couple days.

I called Kodak several times and they claim to have never heard of
Dimezone. They referred me to Eastman Chemical who also have never heard of
it. I have little doubt that I encountered the utmost incompetence, but
thats what they told me even after they "investigated" it and called me back.

I have noticed that insoluble crystals form at the bottom of the container
of the Part B solution after about 6 months.  Does anyone know what causes
this?

  Dan;
          The points that I quoted were from both Silvia Zawadzki and =
Kodak literature, I believe. She is justifably proud of XTOL. It was an =
idea which flew in the face of commonly held professional opinions and =
historical research.
          Phil Davis did an article, Kodak Xtol Film Developer in the =
Nov/Dec 1996 issue of  PHOTO Techniques. He seemed to like it. He ended =
the article with this: "Photographers who are fond of D-76 will be =
pleased to discover that Xtol generally produces of very similar =
gradation, but with the added advantage of a modest increase in =
effective film speed and (according to the documentation) better grain =
and sharpness. In every respect this new developer appeared to do a fine =
job on all the films I processed in it. If it is marketed at a =
competitive price, it should have wide appeal."
          Dick Dickerson and Silvia Zawadzki wrote an interesting =
article, The Genesis of Xtol in the Sept/Oct 1999 issue of PHOTO =
Techniques that explored the  DQE (Detective Quantum Efficiency) of =
different developers. DQE quantifies speed,graininess, sharpness and =
contrast for a developer. Individual qualities can be improved, but the =
total volume of those factors cannot be exceeded. They said that, as a =
class Ascorbic Acid based developers exceeded the DQE of Hydroquinone =
developers. So, XTOL should, by those standards be capable of better =
quality negs than a developer like D-76/ID-11.
          Ctein wrote a two part article in issue no. 25 and 26 (1996) =
of Darkroom User, when XTOL was just being introduced. That's Ed =
Buziak's magazine, now called camera & darkroom. Ctein's opinion was: =
"After my own exhaustive testing, (which will be reported over the next =
two issues of DU) I've been able to confirm Kodak's remarkable claims. =
With just about every film I've tested, MX1620, now known as Kodak Xtol =
developer, produces results as good as or better than D-76. One does not =
see all the improvements with every film, nor does Kodak claim one will, =
But in no case does Xtol (pronounced "ex-tol" woth a short "o") produce =
worse results." ...and when Ctein says exhaustive testing, he really =
means exhaustive testing!

  For all the testing and articles that are written, it only matters if =
you are happy with the negs a developer produces.=20

 I agree she should be proud of Xtol. I use it and am pleased with its =
performance. It is a good product, even better after I got the problems =
associated with our local very hard water sorted out & went with bottled =
water. Now it is predictable & reliable.

If anyone is going to be in the Northern Utah area on March 24, Both she =
and Dick will be giving a presentation on Xtol at Utah State University =
in the morning and at Weber State University in the afternoon. Kent =
Miles, one of Utahs finest and most knowledgeable photographers helped =
set this one up.

I asked the question on test results mainly to see what others thought, =
others who actually use the exhaustive testing I don't like to do. It =
works for me with TMax 100 and FP4 plus & that is all I really need to =
know. It does what I want. Can't ask for much more than that.

Perhaps we are using the wrong terminology to describe our opinion of
lack of sharpness from FP4.  We definitely defer to your better
experience but we were comparing the image of a x14 enlarged TV antenna
on the roof of a friend's house in San Jose taken in 35 mm !  The FP4
image showed 'jagies' but the Delta 100 print was smooth.  Maybe we were
having a bad hair day with the film or perhaps did not describe the
effect properly.

Hear what you say about graded paper too.  Probably fix our 'dim' image
problem with the V35 on constant exposure mode with multi-grade paper
too :-)

Don't know if we are allowed to ask about your next book on this alias
but if not, would you please send a direct e-mail and we will contact
those nice folks at amazon.com for a copy.

Regards
Malcolm (and Sylvia)

Hi Paul,

Ctein wrote a two part article in issue no. 25 and 26 (1996) of Darkroom
User, when XTOL was just being introduced. That's Ed Buziak's magazine, now
called camera & darkroom. Ctein's opinion was: "After my own exhaustive
testing, (which will be reported over the next two issues of DU) I've been
able to confirm Kodak's remarkable claims. With just about every film I've
tested, MX1620, now known as Kodak Xtol developer, produces results as good
as or better than D-76. One does not see all the improvements with every
film, nor does Kodak claim one will, But in no case does Xtol (pronounced
"ex-tol" woth a short "o") produce worse results." ...and when Ctein says
exhaustive testing, he really means exhaustive testing!

Have you (or anyone else, for that matter) tried the print flattener
(glycerin + water) for either wet or dried prints mentioned in the Darkroom
Cookbook, formula 134?  The claim is that this substantially eliminates the
tendency to curl in fiber papers.

Tim,

Please zap this one round the Pure Silver members. Thanks.

I recently posted an email to the Pure Silver group, suggesting that Mr
Thornton's DiXactol developer may be linked to Alzheimer's disease.

I now realise that, since the formula for the developer is unpublished,
since the cause of Alzheimer's disease is unknown, and since I have no
evidence of any kind of connection between this developer and this
disease, that I was foolish and greatly mistaken in making this
defamatory assertion.

I wish to apologise unreservedly for any distress my statement has
caused Mr. Thornton.

Mr. Edmunds

  Well, they certainly have an MSDS for it. Search either Hazard.com or
Kodak's own MSDS site and you will find it. If you call the customer
service number ask for extension 19, the professional division. If Thom
Bell is there he should be able to answer any questions or get the answers.

 I couldn't find Phenidone on Hazard.com but Dimezone S is there. A 5lb

  Unless there is a noticable difference in grain I its possible the
"jaggies" are due to air turbidity rather than to the film. Turbidity is
due to variations of index of refraction because of temperature variations.
Its what is commonly called heat waves. When photographed with a fairly
fast shutter they can result in distorted outlines. With a slower shutter
they blend into a blurriness. So, some care must be used in testing
resolution with distant objects.

  I've mixed it many times over the years. Never had much luck with it. Its
supposed to keep a certain amount of moisture in the emulsion to keep it
from shrinking, which is what causes the curling. It doesn't seem to work.
I don't remember whether I tried the propylene type flattener or not. I
suspect Pakosol is the same as the Kodak flattener but can't find an MSDS
for it.

Malcolm and Sylvia
Now you are walking into a lion's den when you try to describe the meaning
of the word sharpness. It is essentially the content of the whole of my next
book (which, by the way, I shall certainly announce to pure-silver as soon
as it is published in around May - purely in the interests of learning of
course; no commercial motivation whatsoever!).
Big enlargements mainly test out resolution, itself linked to fineness of
grain, whereas acutance has a much more important role to play in our
perception of sharpness. Strangely, having some grain present rather than a
perfectly smooth grain-free image makes it look sharper. I believe the human
brain seeks out sharp detail in an image, and is satisfied when it can find
it in the grain structure itself. Obviously, when the grain becomes too big,
the brain perceives that the image itself is being broken up, and becomes
dissatisfied. So resolution and the final enlargement size linked to grain
size do have a role to play in the word "sharpness". But the usual tests for
sharpness seen in many UK amateur photographic magazines showing huge
blow-ups of tiny sections of a picture are utterly meaningless - indeed
downright misleading.
I refer pure-silver people to a recent article by Ctein, whose work I
respect, in Photo Technique comparing the sharpness qualities of diffuser
versus condenser enlargers where such huge sectional enlargements were shown
to prove the claimed sharpness superiority of diffuser because of less
jagged edges. Wrong! This actually conflicted with what Ctein had written
elsewhere in his fine book 'Post Exposure' about the meaning of sharpness.
Slower, finer grain, film does not mean a sharper image by itself. It was
back in the 1970s when FP4 emerged when I did exhaustive tests of every slow
film on the market in every appropriate developer, followed by 'blind' tests
by viewers to find the sharpest image that I found that FP4, with its more
prominent grain looked sharper than all of them in 10x8 or 12x10
enlargements from 35mm. Curiosity aroused, I then tested Tri-X, and found it
looked sharper still. Of course, when you examined the image closer up, you
could see that fine image resolution wasn't there. But the subjective
immediate impression of "sharpness" was much higher.
Sorry if that means there is no clear answer as to which film is sharpest.
If it were the slowest, then Tech Pan would win hands down, but anyone who
has tried it in comparison to a 'normal' film at 'normal' enlargement sizes
will know that it looks less sharp. I have a couple of test images in the
new book showing just this effect between Tech Pan and FP4 Plus and HP5
Plus.

Perhaps we are using the wrong terminology to describe our opinion of
lack of sharpness from FP4.  We definitely defer to your better
experience but we were comparing the image of a x14 enlarged TV antenna
on the roof of a friend's house in San Jose taken in 35 mm !  The FP4
image showed 'jagies' but the Delta 100 print was smooth.  Maybe we were
having a bad hair day with the film or perhaps did not describe the
effect properly.

Hear what you say about graded paper too.  Probably fix our 'dim' image
problem with the V35 on constant exposure mode with multi-grade paper
too :-)

Don't know if we are allowed to ask about your next book on this alias
but if not, would you please send a direct e-mail and we will contact
those nice folks at amazon.com for a copy.

Subject: PMK part B oxidation 
 

The best check for full activity of PMK is to carefully watch for the color
change cycle as it's being mixed for use.  Add and stir part A in the water,
then add part B while stirring.  I then pull the stirrer out and watch for
the color to change from light straw to blue-green to amber.  If the part B
is oxidized, this change won't occur or, at least, won't be very pronounced.

pH of the part B stock won't really change with the amount of sodium
metaborate dissolved.  I bought a pH meter to check this and there simply is
no change.  To prove that I had bad part B about a year ago, I actually did
what I had learned in when I studied quantitative analysis as an undergrad:
I boiled off the water and measured the remaining solids.

The best suggestion I can make:  if you are not getting full development
with PMK, suspect a part B problem.  Make up new part B.  Keep it in a glass
bottle with little head space.  Some folks report oxidation after a few
months (that's not been my experience - as long as it is in glass, I've
gotten more than a year).  There will be no color change as the part B ages,
only the lost activity.

I also recommend buying sodium metaborate and mixing it up yourself.  It's
really cheap and then you know for sure when it was made, the fact that there 
is a full 300 grams/liter and that it's been in a GLASS bottle from the day you 
mixed it.  Use 105cc liquid measure (of the powder) to make up a total
of 1 liter of stock solution.  ALWAYS use distilled water to make up part B.
The stuff is super saturated as it is and you don't need dissolved solids to
further complicate solution of the powder.

To every body,

    Enclosed is the Kodak'MSDS for XTOL developer. As you will note Kodak
does not give a precise formula but only a range for the different chemical=
s
.From this it is almost impossible to find the right formula corresponding
to XTOL sold.The optimum formula is patented.
    If some one has tried Lith process and more particularly Turbo-fix
technique described in Tim Rudman'book I would be happy to share experience
and results. I usually do multiple tonings after Lith.

  Here's another example: viewers routinely pick out my prints from HP5+ in
Rodinal as being sharper than prints from HP5+ in D-76 1:1, while the D-76
negs resolve much smaller detail with smoother edges.
  Also, 8x enlargements from 35mm are often seen as being "sharper" than
8x10 contacts. <g>

Curt,
How do you check for oxidation, a drop in pH, or does the crystall clear
solution get a colour?

Btw.

I do not seem to be able to keep the SodiumMetaBorate in solution, after
complete solution it starts to crystalize again after a few days, so I
mix it at half strenght, and use a double amount. The solid chemical
stockis supposed to be pure enough, is that also your ewxperience?

This was used a lot back in the '70's with comercial print flatteners 
available. It works becuase the Glycerin attracts and holds water it 
makes those prints flat but the attraction of moisture is not a good 
archival thing to do to your photos. Say hello to Mr. Mold ; )
Flatten your prints in a dry mount press if you want them really flat. 
Better yet, dry mount them with a neutral PH dry mount adhesive onto rag 
board and mat them (or corner mount onto same) and show them off proudly.

Could this be due to the fact that it evaporates
slower and equalizes the time it takes the emulsion
and the paper to dry? As mentioned before possibly in
dry climates when the emulsion dries faster you get
print curl.

Try this, it works for me with very little hassle
1. Hang prints to dry
2. While the print is still damp and most of the water is off of the surface 
(DO     NOT squeegee  the print, it's not necessary).
    place the print in one of those blotter books that dry photo prints, 
they're     readily available in any photo store (Don't over load it. say no 
more than   four prints) skip a few blotters in the book to give the prints 
ample space.    You'll need TWO of these books
3. Place the entire book under a weighted object my 11x14" easel is rather  
heavy and does quite well.  Allow the prints to stay in it for approximately 
8   hours.  At this point the print feels dry to the touch, but in essence it 
really  isn't, the paper can no longer absorb because it's at it saturation 
point
4. Place the prints into the other blotter book and repeat the process ... 
the     second time around, the prints will be dry! Try it, it works even for 
double  weight paper

I use a similar system for up to 20 x 24" prints.  I bought a large number of 
"blotting paper" sheets - about 30 x 40" - at a local art supply store.  I 
cut about 25 x 30" pieces for stacking the prints (double ones, if I feel 
like it, between prints) and press down with a suitable sized sheet of 
plywood and scuba body-weights.  The leftover pieces of blotter I've cut for 
smaller print sizes.  It's a simple and effective system.

Er, a slightly awkward question here chaps ...

Rented Hasselblad for the weekend, got film, got developer, packed
sandwiches and ready to go BUT can anyone tell me how to change the
Paterson Auto Load Reels from 35mm setting to 120 please ?  Tugged,
pulled and pushed in every imaginable way but am afraid of breaking the
darned thing :-<

Much appreciate a quick piece of guidance on this.

Very embarrassed

Take the reel in your both hands, and twist as an 'unscrewing' motion. You 
should hear a click, then pull apart to the desired spacingthe two pieces, 
and twist them back in a 'screwing' motion.

A couple of comments seem to be approproate with the discussion of PMK and
soduim metaborate stability.

1.  Sodium metaborate is a stable material and DOES NOT oxidize either as
the solid  or in aqueous media.  It will, on the other hand,  it will  react
with carbon dioxide to establish an equilibrium between sodium metaborate
and sodium carbonate - pH changes sports fans.  This is a problem if
developers, containing sodium metaborate, are stored in polyethylene bottles
for extended periods of time (or if a lot of air is mixed into the solution
also).  PE bottles pass carbon dioxide like a screen door.  Glass is
impervious.  PMK "B" solution is one example, D-76 is another case.  With
D-76, the pH will take off like a scalded cat while PMK "B" is heavily
buffered so pH changes will not be easily seen.

2.  Since the PMK "B" solution is close to saturated sodium metaborate, a
precipitation of the dissolved salt would be expected if there is a drop in
temperature or if the darkroom is cold.  The crystallized sodium metaborate
should go back into solution on warming and mixing.  Yes, distilled water
should be used for preparing the sodium metaborate solution and it would be
best to weigh the solid rather than trusting to a imprecise volume
measurement.  Store in glass.  If there is a reaction with carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere, the mixture of carbonates and borates will probably
shift the solubility causing solids to precipitate.

In my experience, I have not observed problems with PMK even using chemistry
that had been mixed for a year (and stored in glass). 

As the Okies would say: "Love them yellar negertaives."

I don't know whether I should be giving commercials for my books via
pure-silver, and feel reluctant to do so. Perhaps the best way of dealing
with this is to mention the publisher's web site which lists lots of
interesting photo books anyway, including Tim Rudman's lith printing book.
The site is www.aurumpress.co.uk

Perhaps we are using the wrong terminology to describe our opinion of
lack of sharpness from FP4.  We definitely defer to your better
experience but we were comparing the image of a x14 enlarged TV antenna
on the roof of a friend's house in San Jose taken in 35 mm !  The FP4
image showed 'jagies' but the Delta 100 print was smooth.  Maybe we were
having a bad hair day with the film or perhaps did not describe the
effect properly.

Hear what you say about graded paper too.  Probably fix our 'dim' image
problem with the V35 on constant exposure mode with multi-grade paper
too :-)

Don't know if we are allowed to ask about your next book on this alias
but if not, would you please send a direct e-mail and we will contact
those nice folks at amazon.com for a copy.

Malcolm (and Sylvia)

Barry, if you take a look at the pure-silver charter (www.tundraware.com/pure-silver),
you will see that commercial messages are permitted - once per item as a stand-
alone message (such as announcing a new book) and certainly there is no
problem mentioning something like this occasionally to respond to a specific
question.  As long as this sort of thing does not get abuse and start
consuming a lot of bandwidth, I see no problem with it...

Tim, Thanks. I'll remember for any future occasions. Incidentally,
pure-silver's taking more time than I expected - but that's because it's so
interesting. I'm really glad I subscribed and am mentioning it to customers
when the occasion presents itself.
Barry

Barry, if you take a look at the pure-silver charter
(www.tundraware.com/pure-silver),
you will see that commercial messages are permitted - once per item as a
stand-
alone message (such as announcing a new book) and certainly there is no
problem mentioning something like this occasionally to respond to a specific
question.  As long as this sort of thing does not get abuse and start
consuming a lot of bandwidth, I see no problem with it...

All,
    I had the pleasure this last week to meet one of our list members.  Luc
Novovitch has a gallery in far west Texas and while I was in the area I
dropped by to meet him and see his gallery.  We spent about three hours one
day talking about photography and later I went back and bought a D2v that he
had for sale.  All in all, it was a nice visit.
As usual,
Lee Carmichael

It is hughe: basicly you take a piece of high quality 100% corron art
paper (sized), and apply a "home made" mixture of Platinum (and or
Palladium) salts and a lightsensitive substance : FerrixOxalate (or
AmmoniumFerricOxalate) to it. Than contactexpose it to a negative of
appropiate density under UV light. Develop and there is your Platinum
image; obviously matte, composed of Platinum atoms in the fibers of the
paper. The resulting image has a very long scale, and beautifull mid
tones, usually not very deep shadows. Uncompairable to a "factory"
silver gelatine print.

I've just bought an MPP Mk 7 with a couple of lenses.
Has anyone got access to a photocopy or scan of the original

Robert,
I haven't, but I know a man who almost certainly has - it's John Rhodes, a
really helpful guy, who is a keen member of the MPP owners group who have an
excellent newsletter. John sent me a copy when he realised that I use an MPP
Microflex. You can contact him on john.rhodes@gecm.com
Hope that helps,
Barry Thornton

Has anyone tried making unsharp masks for use with pyro-developed negs?  Is this
redundant because of the edge effects that pyro produces naturally?  Any
insights, web resources, etc. appreciated...

Tim:  Check out the Jan/Feb 2000 issue of View Camera for an article on
unsharp masks for B&W.  Not specific to pyro but interesting how the
contrast range can be altered.

Hi,

Not sure why I have not asked this question sooner.  I noticed that there
are two mixing chambers available for my enlarger.  A few questions:

1)  Which one comes with the enlarger by default, the 35mm or the 6x7?

2)  Is the 6x7 the one to use for 6x7 and larger (up to 4x5)? and the 35
good for sizes up to 6x7?

3)  I am using it for 6x6 and the slightly smaller 6x4.5.  Do I have the
wrong one in if I am using the default?

4)  Lastly:  What is it and why would I want the other one?  Do you have to
replace one every so often for wear
and tear?

Thanks in advance,

Jeffrey Steinberg

  I've just bought an MPP Mk 7 with a couple of lenses.
  Has anyone got access to a photocopy or scan of the original
  instruction manual / book?

  Thanks.

  I think I may have an instruction book (maybe 2) but will check this =
eve & let you know. If not the original 1 certainly 1 dealing with the =
MPP's. I will return.

They gather the light for greatest efficiency.  Keep exposures short.  Long
exposures introduce problems: heat-change of focus as the film bends;
reciprocity failure; opportunity for vibration increases with exposure time
becomes prolonged and/or magnification is increased.  The higher priced
lenses are faster that enable "short" exposures.

While not familiar with your particular enlarger, I can imagine the chambers
wearing out.  It would be inefficient to blow up a 35 with a 4/5 mixing
chamber.  A 4/5 could not be evenly lit with a 35 chamber.

I have two of the three mixing chambers for the LPL, 35 mm and 4x5.  The 
4x5 was standard (which makes sense for a 4x5 enlarger).  It can be used 
with any size neg.

The 35 mm chamber (a few hundred$) has a lens in the bottom that's just big 
enough to cover one frame.  Since the light source is the same, focusing it 
on a smaller area increases the intensity,  about 2 stops more light, so 
the exposure times really drop (by at least a factor of 4, maybe 6).  The 
intensity and eveness of the light source is why I bought a 4x5 enlarger.

I understand there's one for 6x6, too, but it is about the same intensity 
as the 4x5 so I didn't get that (use the 4x5 chamber for anthing larger 
than 35 mm).

You can change chambers without tools in about 1 minute.

Greg,

Probably a #211-75 watt or a #212- 150 watt bulb. You can use either bulb.

    I am getting back into developing and printing B+W after about 20
years off.  I have an old condenser enlarger that needs a new bulb.
There is no label on the enlarger or bulb.  The bulb socket looks like a
regular screw-in light socket.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to
what bulb might be appropriate to use?

Thanks
Greg Walcott

Hallo,

I would like to have some input on a project which is on the shelf for
quite some time now, and should materialise..

I have this box with 12 (well 11 now) unexposed glassplates, and a 1932
russian bellow camera "Fotokor" with glassplate holders. You guessed the
project by now: exposing these glassplates with this camera. This is a
not to serious project, mainly for the fun of it.

The glassplates are: 9*12 cm Geveart Panchromatic ant-halo GEVAPAN 30
PL, made in Belgium, so I assume before the merger with AGFA, Germany
(when did this happen?).

What would be the speed, I do not think the 30 means DIN, since that
would translate to 800 ASA.

How should I process it? I assume a pretty high B+F. Would a divided
developer such as a divided d76
(see http://www.jetcity.com/~mrjones/dd76v.htm) be a good starting
point?

Would adding Benzotriazole to the developer help reducing fog? If so at
what concentration?

I did expose and process one plate in straight d76 some time ago; there
was an image, but unfortunatly I "mis-filed" the shooting conditions of
this plate..

So any feedback appreciated,

Thanks,

Cor

The merger happened in about '63 (maybe late '62).  My dad was working for 
Gevaert begining in '61 and it was about 2 years later they bought Agfa.  By 
1964 I was shooting Agfachrome; that's how I can fix the merger in time.

Good luck with your project.

Curt

  Not sure when the merger happened but it was somwhere between the
publication date of the 1962 handbook and my 1976 Photo-Lab-Index which has
Agfa-Gevaert data sheets dated 1974.
  I have a 1962 Gevaert handbook. Gevapan-30 is ISO-125 film or plate. The
only developers listed are not quite like any of the standard commercial
developers available now. 
There are two with times. The first is:

G.214 Normal Contrast for Sheet Films
Water, at 100F (40C)				750.0 ml
Metol						        2.0 grams
Sodium Sulfite, anhydrous			 25.0 grams
Hydroquinone				        3.0 grams
Sodium Carbonate, anhydrous			 16.0 grams
  or Monohydrated					 19.0 grams
Potassium Bromide					  1.0 gram
Water to make					  1.0 liter

  Time recommended @68F for Gevapan-30 is 4 minutes in a tray or five
minutes in a tank.
  I suggest diluting it 1:1 and extending the time by 1.4 times.

The other formula is G.215 "For sheet films and Plates. Gives maximum speed
at low to normal contrast."
G.215
Water 100F (40C)					750.0 ml
Metol							  4.0 grams
Sodium Sulfite, anhydrous			 25.0 grams
Sodium Carbonate, anhydrous			 10.0 grams
 or monohydrated					 12.0 grams
Potassium Bromide					  0.5 gram
Water to make					  1.0 liter

Develop Gevapan-30 plates 4 min in a tray or 5 min in a tank at 68F

Again, more even development is probable if its diluted 1:1 and time
extended by 1.4X

  Times are given for Gevapan-30 _roll film_ in a developer (G.204) almost
identical to D-76. The times are: @68F Tray, 10 min; Tank, 13 min. Since
the plates are likely coated with the same emulsion the times should be
similar.

  I can't now find my notes on Benzotriazole. I mainly use it for paper.
  The Ilford Phenidone developers which use it as a restrainer use very
little, typically about 0.2 grams per liter of developer. Much more can be
used but it will tend to reduce the film speed. Benzotriazole lowers film
speed less than bromide for a given amount of fog reduction. I would
recommend shooting this stuff at about half speed to push the shadows above
the fog level. This is necessary whether or not a restrainer is used. The
results are somewhat dense negatives (less dense if the restrainer is used)
with increased printing times but adequate toe contrast.
  I don't know how long Gevaert made Gevapan-30. I shot lots of it in roll
film form in the mid 1950's but it may have been in the Gevaert catalogue
for a much longer time. It seems to me, however, that Gevaert used other
trade names at earlier times. I doubt these plates are as old as the
camera, perhaps the style of the printing on the box will be a clue.
  Also, most film of the post WW-2 period carries a well-marked expiration
date. Look for one stamped somewhere. 
  Film or plates from the mid fifties or sixties stands some chance of
being usable to the extent of recording some sort of image. Older stuff
will probably be so badly fogged as to be useless.
  Kodak still makes some glass plates. They are made for special and
scientific use and are very expensive.
  You may be able to find a roll-film adaptor for the camera or even sheet
film adaptors for the plate holders.
  Most people used plate cameras with film pack adaptors but the last film
packs were made about ten years ago.
  I hope this is helpful. Plese let us know about the results.

Thanks very much for a very thorough and useful reply, Richard!

I have all the stuff for the developer, so I will go for the real thing!
I was already planning to shoot it at half of it's speed. And I will
process plate for plate (also because I only have one glass plarte
holder which is light tight..;-)..

Obviously I will post my results!

.

..well there is no date on the box I have, I could scan the label and
put it up on my web side if that would help dating it. I did obtain a
image on one of the plates in a preliminairy test.

Thank you very much again!

Checking in a 1960-61 Handbook Of Chemistry and Physics, Gevapan 30 is
listed as a ASA 64 daylight and ASA 40 tungsten film (both sheet and roll).
Gevapan 33 was listed as the ASA 125 film.  No processing data given.

  This is the original ASA speed method which had a 2.5X safety factor
built in. The method was changed about 1961 to agree with the German DIN
method and the safety factor dropped. It resulted in about doubling the
speeds for all films. My source was late enough to give speeds by the
second ASA method.
  Curiously, the original ASA method of 1945 was based on Kodak speeds and
the work of Lloyd A. Jones of Kodak labs. Jones' idea was to find the
_minimum_ exposure which would result in an "excellent" print. The idea
being that thinner negatives look less grainy and have better sharpness due
to less irradiation (light scattering) because the image is confined more
to the surface of the negative. The ASA evidently thought that a large
safety factor was necessary to insure that some sort of image would be
gotten. The old Kodak handbooks warn that there is large safety factor and
that negatives may be dense along with the recommendation that exposure be
reduced. 
  The original Kodak speed method accounted for the slope of the toe and
was difficult to measure. The DIN method which replaced it used a simple
point defined as 0.1 log density above base+fog. There is some difference
in speeds measured by the two methods for films with unusual
characteristics but not enough to justify the much more difficult analysis
of the Kodak method. The DIN method continues to be the heart of the
current ISO method.

Hello, to the list.

I was in Hay-on-Wye[1] last weekend, and was dismayed to find the photo
bookshop in Back Fold has gone.

Does anyone (e.g. Ed B) know whether it has closed altogether or moved
somewhere else?

Alistair.

[1] For those that don't know, Hay is a small town in Powys, right on Wales'
border with England. Its main special feature is its large number of
second-hand bookshops. They claim to have over 5 mission books for sale in
the town -- I don't know who counted them, though.

Alistair,

Shucks... that must leave only a couple of dozen book shops in that small
town to look through for photo books <s>. Seriously though, I Haydn Pugh
closed down his "Blinking Images" photo bookshop last year which leaves a
bit of a gap in the marketplace. 

I can't think which one the Back Fold shop was... was it the one within the
precincts of the castle? If so then that is a loss... it was expensive but
full of unusual finds.

Hello again, list

Now, let me try to get my words back into order for another message :-o

Has anyone else had problems with a stainless steel sink in a monochrome
darkroom?

I used SS for years without problem. When I moved into my present house six
years ago, I had the opportunity of fitting out an empty room[1] as my
darkroom. I fitted a fairly cheap stainless steel sink. Over a few months,
it developed bad rust spots, but only on the drainer where equipment was
being dried. The manufacturers agreed to replace the sink, but the same
happened to the replacement. I bought another more expensive sink, but the
same happened, albeit a bit more slowly.

I talked to a technician from Ilford (who made most of the chemistry that I
used at that time) but he was of the view that SS was the best material for
resistance to their chemicals, and that they stored many of their
concentrates in SS in their lab.

My present sink is now so badly rusted on the drainer (but the bowl is
unmarked) that it is horrible to use and I'd like to replace it. I don't
want the same to happen over again.

My problem is that the sink does get used for non-darkroom stuff, so a
shallow darkroom sink is not appropriate, much as I'd like one. I have never
seen a plastic sink that lasts well, without discolouration. What I really
want is what I have had in the past; a SS sink that remains mostly
stainless.

Possible causes: the water here is very soft and I have always had quite
hard water in the past; the water sometimes has a lot of dissolved air, such
that it can come out of the tap into a measuring cylinder looking almost
like milk; maybe I am buying cheap and sub-standard SS.

Before you all point the finger, I DO wash my equipment properly! I have had
rust marks form under a film spiral that has been washed by clean water for
half and hour. Anyway, I never previously had problems with SS even when I
first started working in a darkroom at age ten, when cleanliness certainly
was not utmost on my mind.

of that!

Alistair,

There are numerous "Stainless Steels".

Any stainless steel that is to come in contact with photographic chemicals
should be of  "Type 316", otherwise the problems you have already
experienced will continue to plague you.

IOW, "cheap" stainless steel will not survive very long.

cheers,

Ken

Alistar, a couple of questions:

1.  What type of stainless steel is the sink and  drainer made of?  Or does
the supplier know?

2.  What else goes down the sink?  Anything with salt (good old sodium
chloride) in it?  Pd/Pt clearing bath made from hydrochloric acid?  Bleach?

3.  What is the chloride content of your soft water?  Is it "natural" or is
it from a water softning system where salt is used to regenerate the resin bed?

What I am thinking of is the possibility of chloride induced pitting
corrosion which can be a bad actor on most types of stainless steel and will
cause rust like a bugger.  There are some types of stainless steel (some of
the 400 series?)  which are more prone to rust when compared to the usual
304  and 316 types (most commlnly used for sinks and the like).  Usually
stainless is pretty corrosion resistant in wet service as long as you keep
the halogens out.

Best Regards,
     Howard F. Efner

Dear All,

The term "stainless" steel seems to be nothing more than a generic term, more 
often honored in the breach than in the observance.  There are probably 30 
different compositions of stainless steel, having chromium contents ranging 
from 4 to 26 %, nickel from none up to 22 %, and lesser variations in various 
other metals.  I have seen "stainless steel" silverware covered with rust 
after only two nights out on an Aruban "lawn".  It all depends on the type of 
stainless you get, and, from normal retail sources - no one is going to know.

P.S., I think I prefer the rook.

I ordered the 20 rolls of Verichrome Pan from B&H by airmail on 21/2/00 
sending an international bankers order. B&H shipped this to me on 1/3/00 and 
I received it ok on 14/3/00.

I have not used any as yet, but will post results on pure-silver.

Phil Stiles enquired about the cost of FP4 film in the UK. In 120 format, 
single roll rate is ca 2.45 ($3.8), buying ten rolls at a time ca 1.80 
($2.83), prices vary.

Hi Lorena
A 'must read' is Developing by K.I Jacobson and R. E. Jacobson published by
Focal Press ISBN in USA 0 8038 1547 6. There are enough formulae in there in
easy to understand form to keep you busy for years!
Also have a look at the developers section of my web site which has some
interesting info on two bath -
http://website.lineone.net/~barry-thornton/Default.htm - be careful to make
the D in 'Default' a capital letter.

Commercially, I work for my university (La Trobe Uni, based in Australia) as

Don't order any books from amazon, they told me the book i ordered, Zone
system for 35mm photographers, was shipped the same day as i ordered it and
i'm still waiting. Orders from the US usually take 7-14 days to get here.
They said if it is not here by May 2000 to let them know!. This can't be
right. They take your money and keep you waiting.

Hi,

Does anyone have any experience of making and using texture screens for
monochrome printing? As I understand it, textures can be added either by
sandwiching with a texture negative, or placing a screen over the
printing paper. What kind of materials are suitable for the latter - and
are there any commerically available screens which would give a
'painterly' effect? I've seen such screens used in Stu Williamson's
work, which give a nice effect rather like cracked paint on canvas.

I'm going to try shooting some textures specifically for sandwiching. To
get a thin negative, so what is the best approach - underexpose (by 2 or
more stops, I should think) or underdevelop? 

Thanks

Photoshop makes the best texture screens now, but in the past, I used 
patterned shower glass and hi contrast lith images of interesting 
textures.  The shower glass was placed over lith film when the images 
was exposed...leaving a texture on the image.  Or, the lith film was 
sandwiched with the negaive in a glass carrier.

I just received their latest supplement.  I've been a subscriber to the Photo 
Lab Index for 10 years.  The supplements aren't sent on a regular basis, but 
they do fill your subscription in time.  Mine has just run out and cost for a 
new subsciption is $52 for four supplements. "#203 to 206"

You may want to start out wit some tracing paper.  Crumbling  the paper is a 
good idea, you can control the degree of texture by the amount of crumbling.

I have some old photos I want some excellent 4x5 copy negatives shot.  Anyone 
know some GOOD places in the US to send them to have them made?

No, that was not my intent--since the other fellow was saying, in effect,
"boycott them because of so and so" I said that it is not always the
case. They ship millions of items, and are bound to have a mistake here
and there, but it constitutes only a miniscule percentage. Since this is
photo-list, I'm sure some one here has bought stuff from B&H or
Cameraworld. Chances are, /someone/ got screwed, but that does not mean
they are a rotten bunch.

Geez, this is great, my first post the the list and I've already gotten
into hot water...any OMers here?

Oh, if you're wondering, I am in no way attached to Amazon.com, hold no
stock, know no one in the system, etc.

I find it amazing that whenever someone says that I got screwed by so-and-so,
somebody always says "well I got good service from them".  I have never
understood what that means.  I hate Amazon, I bought 3 books that weighted
less than 8 oz, and they charged me like $8.00 for shipping.  I thought it
was outlandish.

Hello All.  I am new since this weekend.  I am a school teacher and had a 
few students interested in photography.  They have been shooting Ilford
Delta 400.  I haven't processed B&W for years, but I had been reading Basic
Tech. of Photo Vol 2 and came across Adams' divided D23 developer  and
thought I would mix up a batch and have the kids try it, figuring that with
its great tolerance for temperature and time they couldn't miss.  Turned out
a complete disaster... negatives so thin I could barely make out what was on
them.  I had taught B&W in the '70s and remembered how easy it is for kids
to screw up...deja vu all over again etc.

Here's what we did, and you can figure out the many possible errors.  We
were using a Jobo CPE2 processor.  I have been developing color films for
years in the Jobo and did a pre wash.  SInce part one of the divided
developer is to be absorbed by the film base maybe wetting the film first
with water was not a good idea?  Temperature was about 24C and we processed
for 4 minutes in bath 1 with constant agitation and the tank as full as
possible...remember this is in a Jobo and the tank is horizontal.  After
Bath 1 we removed the drum from the Jobo and filled the tank, vertical this
time, with Bath 2,  letting it sit for the recommended time, I think 4 or 5
minutes.  Then rinsed the film with water followed by a 7 minute fix in
fresh Kodak fixer.

Processed 4 rolls.  The first film reel out of the drum was incredibly
dense, but then a kid realized she had loaded reversal film on that reel.
The remaining 3 rolls were very thin, almost clear.  I figured that the kids
hadn't paid attention to the EI of the film?  Or that something interacted
with the reversal film and screwed up the developer?

Now the kicker that will have you shaking your head.  The Elon was a pound
plastic jug I had purchased in 1972 for $8.95.  I remembered I had used it
to make D23 back then so it had been opened.  It was now a sandy colored
compound and I thought it was originally white.  The sodium sulfite and the
Kodalk were also purchased in '72.

Called Photographer's Formulary.  They figured Elon should keep for a "long
time, at least 8 or 9 months".  I ordered 100 grams of Elon, and they
suggested I order fresh Sodium Sulfite and Kodalk.  I wondered about the
necessity of that, but it is cheap, and what the heck, I didn't want the
kids to be disappointed again.

So the point of this ramble...fresh chemicals for sure this time, skip the
presoak?  constant agitation in Bath 1 OK?  recommend the kids set their EI
to 250 for Delta 400?  Anything else?

Cordially,

Dan

Screens of many different textures were available many years ago from 
photostat houses in New York and other advertising centers.  They were film 
negatives (or positives, depending on your viewpoint  ;-)   that were 
placed over the photopaper during exposure.  Haven't heard of them for 
a   l  o  n  g    time.

You can also try nylon stockings, gauze, cheesecloth placed over the paper or
the enlarging lens.
Also try experimenting with saran wrap kinda crushed up over the paper.
I also remenber reading where a print made on fiber based paper allowed to
soak in hot water until the emulsion started to loosen could be gently
manipulated and stretched into weird shapes.
Another effect called 'crazing' can be produced by soaking film in hot water
until the emulsion softens, but doesn't float off the celluloid base, then
dunking it in cold water. The emulsion snaps back and breaks into lots of
little cracks. This is obviously permanent so don't try it on one of a kind
negatives.

Dan,
        I was a devoted user of D-23 two bath when the thicker emulsion
films were around.  For the alkali second bath to work advantageously, the
emulsion must retain enough developing agent from the development.  Perhaps
such a modern thin-emulsion film as Tmax is not the best candidate for this
treatment.  D-23 two-bath worked wonderfully with Super Panchro-Press and
Super-XX for normal and compacted development.  As for your initial
development, four minutes seems quite short to me, based on my experience
with the Tmax films.  They seem to require a fair amount of time to develop
sufficient inertia in development even with energetic developers.  Ten to
twelve minutes seems a more likely starting point to me.
Best of luck!
Mike Chambers

Hello !
May I give you my 2 cents ?
Long ago in a metallurgic class, I was told that "true" SS is
"amagnatic" (this is French, I do not know how to translate it) (i. e. a
magnet wouldn't stick to it) this is due to the fact that iron is not
the prime constituent of SS. So as it is iron which rusts, the term SS.
There are many many grade of SS some sort, like the one used to make
catalyzed car exhausts, will suffer from hard corrosion (turning blue to
the heat of the gasses passing through) but not "turning into rust" in
front for high temperature water coming from the chemical reaction into
it.
So if you are unable to find a "correctly" priced SS sink in your area,
why not consider a china sink ?
Or a wooden one coated with fiber glass and resin ? (sold at boat repair
shops)
Hope this helps !

Hi everybody !
May I ask you all something ?
I am experiencing difficulties with some of your postings, as they often
do not relate to the original subject.
As an example, the Stainless steel discussion turned out to texture
screens....
Some of you use HTML postings, with so tiny fonts I must enlarge them to
read the text.
So could you please revert to "text only" messages and hit " reply to"
or "new message" button according to your feelings....
I ask this because I think this discussion list so valuable I keep all
the messages stored somewhere on my disc as a reference.... So threading
_is_ important to me !
Cheers !

Dan, since you are modeling a scientific approach (as opposed to random
behavior) pre testing one test before going ahead full steam would be
better.
It is clever to go from horizontal to vertical for this developer in spite
of how easy it would have been not to.
As I recall there is a great loss of film speed with split D-23.  Since this
is a to completion type developer (sort of) "things" aren't all that
critical.  The prebath would stabilize the reels, film and tank temperature
for repeatability (precision) but this developer process is not "critical"
er, precision demanding.  Modern films are "tough" and can handle the higher
temperature and the time is just long enough to make the pre-bath not
critical even though Jobo recommends it.

I seem to recall that the simplicity of D-23 included the teaspoon
measurement system.

Existence comes upon us

Make your four minutes into 7 and a half.  Jobo's need extended and I never
develop for less than 6 minutes with anything.

I do everything by inspection, so I look and thentime, and that's possibe,
too; if you use a gree light for 15 seconds or less and check in the dark,
chart it yourself.

Yes, by the way, you must add another minute for the pre wash; and 400 is
best shot at 265 at normal , anyway.

Oh dear! How could you murder divided development in this way!
It sounds to me as though your chemicals were dead, or that the reversal
film damaged them in some way. The trouble with Ansel Adams D23 formula,
fine for sheet film, is that it is too strong with roll film, not too weak.
You should have got very dense negatives with your regime with roll film. My
web site will give you amended formulae for two bath (same as divided)
development. It's http://website.lineone.net/~barry-thornton/Default.htm -
be careful to make the D in 'Default' a capital letter.
The whole point of two bath development is not to have continuous agitation.
This destroys the very auto compensation that the process is designed to
achieve. It also destroys the edge effects that the split metol formulae
provide for excellent acutance.
The idea is to give the minimum agitation possible in each bath without
streaking occurring. Usually, this is about once a minute in bath A, and a
couple of times in bath B. depending on water supply, some people can
actually get away with no agitation at all in bath B.
Prewash makes no significant difference. The water soaked into the film in
the prewash is replaced by the developer in the first 30 seconds in bath A.
Development does take place in this bath. It is after all D23 which is quite
capable of developing Tri-X, for instance, on its own with no bath B
activation in about 7 minutes if my memory serves me right.
The modified formula I use (see web site) is excellent for students being
very tolerant of exposure variations and the development of different films
together (within reason - don't mix Pan F with Neopan 1600!). It is also
very economical, long lasting, sharp and fine grain. Speed is just about
normal.
You don't have to mix your own bath A. There are ways of using standard
developers for this, and simply teaspooning bath B. The web site reveals
all. Don't be put off by your poor results to date. The results are well
worth the persistence.

Hello All.  I am new since this weekend.  I am a school teacher and had a
few students interested in photography.  They have been shooting Ilford
Delta 400.  I haven't processed B&W for years, but I had been reading Basic
Tech. of Photo Vol 2 and came across Adams' divided D23 developer  and
thought I would mix up a batch and have the kids try it, figuring that with
its great tolerance for temperature and time they couldn't miss.  Turned out
a complete disaster... negatives so thin I could barely make out what was on
them.  I had taught B&W in the '70s and remembered how easy it is for kids
to screw up...deja vu all over again etc.

Here's what we did, and you can figure out the many possible errors.  We
were using a Jobo CPE2 processor.  I have been developing color films for
years in the Jobo and did a pre wash.  SInce part one of the divided
developer is to be absorbed by the film base maybe wetting the film first
with water was not a good idea?  Temperature was about 24C and we processed
for 4 minutes in bath 1 with constant agitation and the tank as full as
possible...remember this is in a Jobo and the tank is horizontal.  After
Bath 1 we removed the drum from the Jobo and filled the tank, vertical this
time, with Bath 2,  letting it sit for the recommended time, I think 4 or 5
minutes.  Then rinsed the film with water followed by a 7 minute fix in
fresh Kodak fixer.

Processed 4 rolls.  The first film reel out of the drum was incredibly
dense, but then a kid realized she had loaded reversal film on that reel.
The remaining 3 rolls were very thin, almost clear.  I figured that the kids
hadn't paid attention to the EI of the film?  Or that something interacted
with the reversal film and screwed up the developer?

Now the kicker that will have you shaking your head.  The Elon was a pound
plastic jug I had purchased in 1972 for $8.95.  I remembered I had used it
to make D23 back then so it had been opened.  It was now a sandy colored
compound and I thought it was originally white.  The sodium sulfite and the
Kodalk were also purchased in '72.

Called Photographer's Formulary.  They figured Elon should keep for a "long
time, at least 8 or 9 months".  I ordered 100 grams of Elon, and they
suggested I order fresh Sodium Sulfite and Kodalk.  I wondered about the
necessity of that, but it is cheap, and what the heck, I didn't want the
kids to be disappointed again.

So the point of this ramble...fresh chemicals for sure this time, skip the
presoak?  constant agitation in Bath 1 OK?  recommend the kids set their EI
to 250 for Delta 400?  Anything else?

Cordially,

Dan

Hi everybody !
May I ask you all something ?
I am experiencing difficulties with some of your postings, as they often
do not relate to the original subject.
As an example, the Stainless steel discussion turned out to texture
screens....
Some of you use HTML postings, with so tiny fonts I must enlarge them to
read the text.
So could you please revert to "text only" messages and hit " reply to"
or "new message" button according to your feelings....
I ask this because I think this discussion list so valuable I keep all
the messages stored somewhere on my disc as a reference.... So threading
_is_ important to me !
Cheers !

Hi everybody !
May I ask you all something ?
I am experiencing difficulties with some of your postings, as they often
do not relate to the original subject.
As an example, the Stainless steel discussion turned out to texture
screens....
Some of you use HTML postings, with so tiny fonts I must enlarge them to
read the text.
So could you please revert to "text only" messages and hit " reply to"
or "new message" button according to your feelings....
I ask this because I think this discussion list so valuable I keep all
the messages stored somewhere on my disc as a reference.... So threading
_is_ important to me !
Cheers !

I'm Howard's daughter, but I noticed your note.
I've ordered several things from Amazon with admirable results.  However,
you may want to check the shipping type that you asked for.
I ordered a new cd that was marked "Next day."  However, the shipping
preferences were set to normal mail - so it took about three to four days to
arrive.
Also overseas shipping may be more chancy then normal - I wouldn't really know.
I also think there's some sort of tracking thing on the website that allows
you to check on the status of your order.
Hopefully I've been some help -

Hi Dan,

Well, you've come to the right place.  I processed thousands of 
rolls/sheets of film in D-23 on a Jobo when I ran an in-house lab for 
a hot shot commercial photographer.  We may have been murdering two 
bath developement, but the method I used worked for us and has lots 
of lattitude.

I ran a 5 minute pre-wash, Bath A for between 5-12 minutes depending 
on the film and exposure, Bath B for 3 minutes (still on the Jobo 
with constant agitation) and then stop 45" and fix 5'.  The recipe 
for the chemistry was straight out of the Darkroom Cookbook and the 
tanks were filled as reccomended by Jobo for the size of the tank. 
It's simple, down and dirty and it works.

Good luck.

Amy Hahn

P.S.  If you don't have the Darkroom Cookbook, let me know and I'll 
fax the D-23 page to you

I'd second the motion on insufficient developing agent picked up by a thin 
emulsion.  Note on the Diafine box TMZ is rated at several stops less than 
its 3200 speed.   I tried it--that is correct.

Hai, 
About a week a go I wrote about a small project:

> I have this box with 12 (well 11 now) unexposed glassplates, and a 1932
> russian bellow camera "Fotokor" with glassplate holders. You guessed the
> project by now: exposing these glassplates with this camera. This is a
> not to serious project, mainly for the fun of it.

> The glassplates are: 9*12 cm Geveart Panchromatic ant-halo GEVAPAN 30
> PL, made in Belgium,

>From the responses I understood that these plates were at least 38
yesars old (older than me..;-)..), and Richard Knoppow kindly provided
the formulka for the appropiate developer.

I just did some preliminairy experiments: I made a photogram by placing
a object on a glas negative, exposed (turning the light briefly on) and
processed in the G214 developer. Sadly, but not very surprisingly the
unexposed area showed a very high B+F, about middle gray.

I am afraid that there isn't much use for the plates anymore, and adding
benzotriazole wouldn't probably help a lot I assume (although I might
try it anyway)

One more related question, more out of curiousity: how do you determine
on which side of the glassplate the emulsion is? I ran a wet finger
along the glass side (at least what I thought what the glass side was),
but I do not find that a very good or recommandable metod.

Thanks again for all the feedback on this little project,

Cor

  If the back of the plate is plain a damp finger will tell you which is
the emulsion side since it will feel tacky. I think that is what you
already did. Since these are "anti-halo" plates they likely have a coating
of gelatin on the back with the anti-halation dye in it. That will feel
exactly like the emulsion side. AFAIK there is no marking, like the edge
notches on sheet film, to orient the plates. Probably you simply have to
determine how they are packed and keep track of which side is which.

Thanks to each of you who responded to my call for assistance re: divided
developer.  I mixed a new batch with fresh chemicals using Barry Thornton's
formula as published on his website.  Film used was Ilford Delta 400, a thin
emulsion T-grain(?) type of film I understand similar to Kodak TMax 400.
Manually processed for 4 minutes with 5 seconds of agitation every minute in
Bath 1.  Chemistry at 22 C.  No rinse between Baths 1 and 2.  4 minutes in
Bath 2 with 5 seconds of agitation at 2 minutes.  Fixed for 7 minutes.  Wash
15 minutes and Photo Flo.

Had 2 runs: I did a test roll before the kids came in, and then they
processed 2 reels in another run.  ALL the negatives are printable as re:
density.  I was very pleased with mine from a technical standpoint...nice
gradation and printable highlights as well as good shadow detail. The kids
will be able to print any negative that they wish.  That is quite a
statement at least from my remembrance of teaching teenagers.

My conclusion is that this will become my developer of choice for 35mm.
Must have incredible tolerance while producing very printable negatives.
Each of you respondants have your own method of using this developer...some
of you use it for 2 or 3 times my time, some with constant agitation, some
totally automated in a Jobo, some with prewash, and each of you have stated
good results.

For sure it works fine with "modern, thin emulsion" films.

Dan

Hi Dan,
While I have limited experience with D-23 per se, I do have a lot of
experience with its cousin Microdol-x and Kodalk.  I have never used a Jobo
to process with that combination.  I generally tray process everything.
Large format and all.  Even with the new emulsions I pre soak.  I am told by
those that should know (People at Jobo) that you should pre soak for 5
minutes so that your development times remain close to your tray development
times.  I have always done that for at least 20 years now.  I use the
divided development for reciprocity failure problems and to help reduce
contrast.  I generally cut about 15% of the time off the Microdol part and
continue to agitated in the Kodalk for 4 minutes.  Then straight to the fix
for the required times.  I have found that I need to support the shadow
detail by increasing the exposure by at least one more stop.  In this case,
Box says 400 I normally would shoot at 200 and for this I expose at 100 for
the shadow detail.

As to the age of the chems I would point to that as most of the problems.
Good luck.
As usual,
Lee Carmichael

I am delighted you got good results. I run a commercial custom hand
processing business, mostly for professionals, and this formula has
processed thousands of rolls of film for very satisfied customers. I always
use it when the customer is not sure of their film speed assessment and
exposure technique with monochrome film, and it has saved many films from
being unprintable.
Of all films, ultra tolerant as the developer is, I find that Delta 400
needs a little extra time to produce the very best negs. 5 minutes in each
bath works best for me for this emulsion. I found this out when I field
tested Delta 400 Pro for Ilford before they released it, and tried it in
about 50 different developers! For the record, I still prefer HP5 Plus. That
too responds beautifully to my modified D23 two bath, or to
Perceptol/Microdol X 1:2 12 minutes @24C, or my two bath Di Xactol.

I have limited experience with anti-halation coated plates, but I don't
think the anti-halation coating is in gelatin - it doesn't have to be. My
favourite method for finding the emulsion side of a plate is by trying to
scratch the upper right corner (where the notch would be on sheet film)
using a pocket knife. If you can scratch the plate, you've got the
emulsion side. This can also be used for a primitive numbering system if
you are exposing several plates at the same time - one scratch, two
scratches, etc. I dislike damp fingers on the emulsion, the resulting
fingerprints are likely to damage larger areas of the plate than a small
scratch.

For the plates I have dealt with, the plates are either stored in a
slotted plastic insert in the box, in which case the emulsion side is
facing in the same direction for all plates, so if you've found it for one
plate, youre sorted. The other packaging style I've seen is the plates
packed in pairs, with spacers between them. In this case the emulsion
sides of each pair of plates are facing each other.

One of the hairiest things I've ever done in the darkroom was to
spray-paint an anti-halation coating on a batch of panchromatic glass
plates - in total darkness. Matt black Tetenal Kameralack did the job
nicely, and I managed to coat all the plates completely, and not too much
of the darkroom fittings...

Hello Barry,
We exposed this film at EI400 (Ilford Delta 400).  Had another run today
that looks fine.  This student has been spending the last 9 days (actually
evenings) in jail.  Interesting pictures!  My point is that we have now
processed 6 rolls shot by 4 different photographers, 3 of whom have never
used an SLR before.  No calibration, no film speed test, no checking of the
meters on the cameras much less their shutters.  None of the cameras used
are recent vintage...I use a Pentax LX, I gave the fellow in jail an older
Canon FTb, the girls use a Nikon FM and a Canon A1(?).  All manual cameras.
All the pictures are "grab" shots or "candids" which are tough to expose
correctly even if you do know what you are doing.

Next run we'll try five minutes in each bath, though I suspect from our
style we will be unable to make a good assessment of the difference.  What I
particularly like is that we can process rolls so easily not having to be
particularly concerned with temperature or time for that matter.  Kids can
"go to it", and only have to futz with the wash water temperature for the
entire process, and concentrate on taking interesting pictures rather than
the processing side of equation.

Again, thanks to each of you for your thoughts, and particularly to Barry
for putting up the "modern" information needed to try divided developers.

Dan

Hi, I am Daniel Eugenio and this is my first message to the group although
I've been reading all mails since several months ago.
Sorry if this is not a photographic issue but I couldn't stop myself on
telling anyone the following.
Just to contribute to the "buying by mail" confussion.
I ordered from Family Tree Maker (Broderbund software guys) update to
version 7.5 of FTM. The ad in the web said U$D 19.99 as an offer and U$D5
for shipping in the US  and a small warning that overseas charges could be
greater (not specifing how much).
I bought it anyway (closing my eyes) and expecting, let say U$D 10
(double!?) for
overseas shipping (I live in the UK).
5 days later the goods arrived, guess how much the shipping
was...........U$D 35
So in within US is 5 dollars, everywhere else seven times more!, and there
is no option to select a cheaper shipping.
You've been warned.

Regards

Daniel Eugenio

Sounds good. By the way, don't knock the Pentax LX - it's what I use. To me,
it's modern!

During the late 1950's early 60's I worked in the darkrooms of the local 
evening newspaper. When loading 5x4 plates into dark slides I would touch a 
corner of the plate lightly on the inside of my bottom lip, the emulsion side 
was distinctly tacky.

Hi Jim,

Right here is the best place, in the mail list that is...  I also shoot LF 
(4x5) and develop the FP4 with PMK Pyro in a Jobo 3010 processor.  I only 
recently started using PMK and the Jobo, I love the results!

Slightly off topic, but not too much I hope.

I recently obtained Gordon Hutchings Book of Pyro, and on page 69 I came
across his opinion on flare: he claims that (esp. when working Large
Format) flare adds considerable to the effective EI (by acting as a
pre-exposure?), and one should add upto 1 stop extra to the tested EI
(depending on the light conditions).

Thus far I did not pay to much attention to the contribution of flare
and this is the first time I came across such a reference.

Are people following his recommendations, and have tested this
contribution of flare?

Hello Guy,
Texture negatives suitable for sandwiching can be made on Kodalith type 3.
2556,
developed for high contrast in lith developer or in a print developer where
some
half tones are needed. This film has a clear Estar base that makes it ideal.
It can also
be processed in a red safelight.
Bracket exposure and develop normally until you can see what you are after.
If a full
range of tones is needed use Kodak fine Grain Positive film, again use print
developer.
Stone, brick, concrete, marble, cement, plaster, sandpaper, "arty"
wallpaper, tomb stones!
are some suggestions; photograph in side lighting is usually best.  You may
have to reverse
some of these negatives by contact printing (emulsion to emulsion) on to the
same film stock.
Some materials can be used as a sandwich directly with the negative, such as
certain
lens cleaning tissues and negative storage bags.  Fine fabrics such as
chiffon, tulle and the
like make good contact printing screens. These can also be copied via a
lightbox onto film
for use as a sandwich. Tissue paper (big choice here) is effective, covered
with a sheet of
glass from a cheap clip frame which comes nicely edged. Non reflective glass
(single sided type)
with the etched side in contact works well, as do A4 plastic wallets of the
kind that have a very fine
bubble pattern.
PhotoShop textures have been suggested, but these are not sufficiently
random for what I suspect
you want,  but if you can create something you like in PS, reverse and print
on matt paper, you have
something ready to copy for use as a sandwich negative. An original border
could be created this
way. Inkjet plastic film is another possibility which can be copied from a
lightbox onto film. Another
way with acrylic sheet is to paint with brush sponge or fingers using black
or red acrylic artists colour,
to suit your negative and copy in the same way onto Kodalith type 3.
I hope this gives you some ideas.  Happy hunting!
Clifford.

This maybe a little off base for this group.
After spending the weekend working and attending a Lepp seminar, I feel I'm
not ready to enter the digital age.  It seems you are going to be constantly
upgraded some facet of your digital darkroom.  Anyway, I walked away with a
question.

Do you think it will still matter what kind of developer you use on your
negatives, if you plan to scan and print them out on one of those new epson
printers.

Being an "analog" darkroom (ie classical ) type, I say yes!  The data from a
scan is only as good  as the starting negative or in other words, GIGO
(garbage in, garbage out).

John,

Of course it matters, ever hear the term Crap in, Crap out.  The better the
image is to begin with the better the final product will be, A good scanner
and Photoshop can make even the most under or over exposed negative usable
and possibly OK, but a image from a good negative always ends up looking the
best.

Hi All, As I am fairly new to the list I realise that this topic may have 
been covered recently, please excuse me if it has. It has been a great shock 
to hear that Ektalure is to be discontinued-- I am probably the last to hear 
of this---it is one of my favourite papers. I am thinking of ordering a stock 
from Silverprint and would like to know of anyone's experience as to how long 
it should keep,( in the fridge, ) presuming that the stock I receive is 
relatively fresh. Best wishes, Saffron Branfoot.

    I think it will, not only that, but your choice of film also matters.  
Different films and different developer combinations create different 
characteristics/moods.  You gain insight into photography when you're capable 
of recognizing the different characteristics and producing the varied results 
for your prints.  You may be able to duplicate these characteristics with a 
digital format, however, the initial steps are still with film selection and

Everyone, thanks for answering my question.

I thought it would matter too, but you are able to make changes to the
scanned negative during the prescan that could defeat the purpose of using a
specific developer.

Yes, its sad but true.  I myself stocked up on a lot of the paper and 
have had my local supplier keep it in their emulsion control fridge. 
I have had it their since the last summer and it still is holding up 
as if it were brand new.  I can't say how long it will last but cold 
storage does keep it for quite a while.

I have a question about Tech Pan.

I was recently given some 4x5 Tech Pan film.  Does anybody have any
experience using Tech Pan as a continuous tone film?  I usually use Tmax
100 and prefer quite a gentle negative. My photographic subject is usually
landscapes and would like to be able to use this free film.  The
developers I usually use are HC110 or TmaxRS and I process in a
JOBO.  I was wondering about HC110 dilution F and starting at ca. 4
minutes?  Any other ideas?

Hi - I've been Lurking on this list for about a week without contributing
anything, but I have used quite a bit of Tech Pan film.  My best results
have been with Photographer's Formulary TD-3. This developer is especially
formulated to achieve the maximum speed from Tech Pan, and does a nice job
at ISO 80 (or so).  Kodak's Technidol will also work well at a lower ISO
rating.  I would not recommend HC110 for Tech Pan. Regards --- John.

I have a question about Tech Pan.

I was recently given some 4x5 Tech Pan film.  Does anybody have any
experience using Tech Pan as a continuous tone film?  I usually use Tmax
100 and prefer quite a gentle negative. My photographic subject is usually
landscapes and would like to be able to use this free film.  The
developers I usually use are HC110 or TmaxRS and I process in a
JOBO.  I was wondering about HC110 dilution F and starting at ca. 4
minutes?  Any other ideas?

I don't know about any possible differences in emulsion between the 4x5 
version and the 120 size that I use, but......if they are the same, I think 
you'll like the results.  I rate my TechPan at 50 ASA and develop it in 
dilution F for 6 minutes at 68F.  I am pleased with the negatives I get and 
find that they print quite well with normal -ish contrast grades of paper.  
However, I like contrast and, at 6 minutes, the negatives might be more dense 
than you'd like.  Starting at 4 minutes sounds about perfect.

rather than the rather more flat 0.50 to 0.70 achieved with Technidol (which 
I didn't particularly care for).  In addition, I found myself losing more

I have always kept my out of production papers in the deep freeze - an 11x14
box of paper just fits inside a two-gallon ziplock bag, which I use as a
vapor barrier.

Pete - I guess it depends on the nature (and contrast) of the subject.  The
kind of stuff I shoot tends to be quite contrasty and HC110 wasn't able to
control it.  What problems did you have with Technidol liquid? --- John.

<SNIP>

Two suggestions that have worked for me on small and medium format Tech Pan:

1.  Try Ethol TEC (thin emulsion compensating developer) and start with an
EI of about 80-100.  They recommend a 1:30 dilution on the developer and 5.5
min time.  Might want to go to 6ish.  35mm negs look thin but print well on
a cold light head at a 2 to 2 1/2 grade setting.  Don't worry about the
highlights but get the shadow exposure.

2.  A second developer is Rodinal at 1:100 and about 7 minutes.  Film speed
is a bit less than with the TEC and tends to be a bit more contrasty.  Got
to be careful to get the shadows exposed or they will drop to black.

I have done some with HC-110 but have had problems with controlling the
contrast.  On the other hand 10 min in dilution B is a good start for
astrophotography applications where the higher contrast will supress low
level sky fog from the %*^%* light pollution.

Good luck and let us know what happens.
Best Regards,
     Howard F. Efner

In a message dated 00-03-27 18:40:11 EST, you write:

<<  What problems did you have with Technidol liquid?  >>

Well, John,

I think I had the usual difficulty determining just how quickly to agitate, 
how long to agitate, how often to agitate.  I got it to a point where it 
looked pretty good in the negative, so I did a bunch of rolls.  I didn't 
notice any problems with the contacts, but when I enlarged them, I noticed 
that I was having to burn-in the sides a bit.  On every frame.  I knew what 
that meant, and then I happened to read an article in Darkroom & Creative 
something or other - they keep changing the name over the years.  The fellow 
who wrote the article had tried other developers, and managed to wean himself 
from the hassle (and ridiculous cost) of Technidol, and switched to 
Flexicolor.  I don't do any color work (at least, not since 1968), but the 
idea of heresy appealed to me.  I bought a small trial color kit, just to get 
the developer.  I also decided to try the HC-110, based on the Kodak 
information.  As a control, I used the Technidol.  Regarding grain, of course 
the Technidol won.......but it didn't allow me to guarantee any sharper 
prints.  My eyes are bad, and I rely on the Microsight grain focuser.  I 
couldn't use it with the Technidol, so my prints were touch and go.  Both the 
RA-4 (is that what its called - I forget) and the HC-110 were a dead heat, 
and with barely detectible grain - but just enough for my enlarging work.  I 
haven't looked back since.  And I can be as irresponsible with my agitation 
as I want to be, and the negatives come out perfectly.

Hello John,

First you must be aware of the dynamic range of your scanner as you are with the
contrast when you develop for condenser or diffusion enlargers. You have to
control your developing process to meet the requirements of your scanner so you
can get the max. of your negative. The resolution needed  depends on the kind of
output you want to get, postscript outputs are AM outputs and ink jet printers
usually are FM. AM outputs control the amplitude of the point and FM the
frequency of points. AM outputs require more input resolution than FM so the
scanner must get more data from the negative.

Regards,

Technically, paper and film do not freeze. They do not have enough moisture
content.  Still, lowering the temperature does slow the chemical changes
that occur over time that constitute aging, thus extending their life.

Exposed film can be kept a long time before development, especially if cold.
I suspect the same is true of paper.  For some reason, paper not processed
right away increases slightly in density compared to paper that is processed
immediately after exposure.  At least that used to be true.  I have not
tested papers recently but I suspect it is still the case.

Frank,

Nova supply a product called "Hydra Sprint Processor Cleaner" in a
spray-type dispenser available in 1 or 5 litre sizes... the 1 litre package
retails for the equivalent of $15 in the UK. Nova have a trade link-up with
Jobo in the States so it should be available where you are.

BTW: I wouldn't be surprised if Hydra is a US company and the product is
rebadged for use in the UK.

Its not necessary to buy commercial cleaning solutions - using a weak
(say, 5%) solution of citric acid, which is easily obtainable from
chemical suppliers. While you are there, pick up a burette cleaner. This
is a long, thin nylon brush which is ideal for cleaning the slots of
nova tanks.

Hope this helps.

How much water does it take to successfully wash an 11x14 RC print?  I know 
the instructions for Ilford is to wash for 2 mintues.  I usually go for about 
5 using about 11 gallons of fresh water a minute.

Guy,

I've used a flue-brush too... but probably the wrong size. Got mine from the
hardware store and learnt the tough way not to use it. After a couple of
seconds pulling and thrusting my face was covered in specks of chemical,
soap, gunk and whatever had accumulated in the first slot... luckily I was
wearing glasses so my eyes didn't smart... and I guess I wasn't too smart
either.

I suspect you might be overwashing to the point where the optical brightner
is being washed out of the support. "Successful" RC washing does not need
11 gallons/minute. Since RC prints are (generally) fixed in a non-hardening,
"rapid" fix the fixer will wash out of the emulsion relatively quickly.
I think 5 minutes at your "rate" might be a bit of overkill, and suggest
(if you
have control), you turn the time/volume per min. down... considerably.

....No...no joke.  Sometimes I wash longer.  I figured out my gal/min rate by 
collecting the water in a cooler tub.  Is this enough or too much or does it 
really matter?  I have washed up to 15 minutes at this rate when I get busy

  RC prints wash out fine in four minutes in a washer where the water is
replaced every five minutes (Kodak recommendations). You CAN overwash
prints. The old idea that _all_ hypo should be washed out is wrong. A small
residue of hypo protects the image from damage by oxidants in the atmosphere.
  Long washing will tend to wash out the brightners as pointed out in
another post. However, the brightners tend to come out rather quickly at
first and not much more comes out after an extended time. Still, overly
long washes are not necessary and do no good.
  11 gallons a minute is a _lot_ of water. What are you washing in?  I
usually wash RC prints singly in a tray with a Kodak tray siphon. Works
fine. I have prints several years old which show no sign of fading or
staining.
  For really long life tone the print.

supples flow at the 1/2 to 2 1/2 gal per minute range, so I bet yours is 
1.1 gal min. unless you are at the firestation.......
4 minutes at this rate is plenty- use a hypo clearing agent before 
washing.

Phil,

No washing aid is required for RC prints.

Sodium or ammonium thiosulphates tend to become "attached" to paper fibers
as fixing progresses... the washing "aid", before washing helps "change"
the thiosulphates to a more soluble chemical to reduce the long was times
you would need without the wash-aid. Ilford proposed that a shorter fix
time at a higher concentration (with no hardner) assisted the reduction of
thiosulphates absorbed by paper fibres

Since RC "papers" have no paper fibres to "absorb" the chemicals, a washing
or clearing aid is not required.

Titanium dioxide is not water soluble.  I do not think that extended
washing will affect it by either chemical or physical means.

  Its not recommended for the reasons I mentioned in my post about
over-washing. RC washes out so fast that using a wash aid is really not
necessary and may take out too much hypo. It _is_ a good idea to use it for
prnts which are to be selenium toned or sepia toned with a bleach and
redevelop type toner. Both sepia and sulfiding toners provide the image
protection. Sepia should be used in a concencentration of not less than 1:9
for at least three minutes since it does not tone all densities evenly.
  The wash aid prevents the deposition of elemental selenium which can
happen if the print is acidic. The increased washing is beneficial when
bleaching since the ferricyanide bleach used for indirect toning forms
Farmer's reducer with any residual hypo in the print. This slight reduction
is one reason that it is often recommended that prints to be sepia toned
this way be made darker than the final print is to be. Full washing of RC
with a wash aid will pretty much eliminate this effect.

  Its not the Tio2 which washes out. The Tio2 is the material which
provides the white backgroiund for the iamge. It is contained in the
plastic layer under the emulsion. 
  What washes out is the optical brightner. This is a material, very
similar if not the same, as the stuff in laundry soap. It glows blue under
UV light making the white areas of the paper seem brighter. You can see its
action under UV light. The same long wave UV which makes you shirts glow
blue will make the prints glow blue.
  Not all paper has the brightner. Kodabromide is free of it as (I think)
is Azo. If you compare a Kodabromide print with one on an RC paper in
daylight or under flourescent light you will find the Kodabromide print
looks dingy. Under tungsten light the prints will look the same or nearly
the same. There isn't enough UV in incandescent light to excite the
brighteners enough to make a visible difference.
  AFAIK, the brighteners have no effect on image liftime. They are also
found in many modern fiber papers.

All this information on the washing of RC prints has made me (again)
question my methods for washing the single weight paper prints that i
customarily make.

A question on this subject was posed some time ago on this list, to the
effect that the photogapher would accumulate prints in a water bath during a
printing session, if I remember correctly, and then conduct the washing of
the dozen or more prints at one time. I don't recall seeing direct response.

My routine is to wash the bunch of prints for five or more minutes after the
last print is placed in the bath, with much agitation and using a Kodak
siphon, then constant agitation in PermaWash for five minutes, then a final
wash of about 10 or more minutes with frequent hand agitation of prints and
enough water flow to operate the siphon, followed by ferrotyping (Polymax F
paper).

Any advice?

Bill and all,

I want to chime in and stir things up a bit.  I do not feel that the
PROCEDURE is that important.  The RESULTS are the desired product.  Whether
one uses a tray siphon, archival washer or ties the prints on a string and
dangles them in the stream behind the house does not matter.  If the amount
of residual fixer and silver salts can be reduced to satisfactory levels,
then the goal has been accomplished.  There are too many variables in the
equation to give a washing procedure that will work for all of us.   Local
water quality, temperature, availability, paper, fixer, other processing or
toning done, etc. etc. will determine the washing sequence that works for
each of us.  Water conservation requirements may require the use of a
washing aid and a low  flow archival washer.

Myself, I wash single weight prints (AZO) in a archival washer after
selenium toning for about 20 to 30 minutes (water flow ca 1 gpm).  Double
weight fiber prints  usually get an hour. Residual hypo and silver test
results were satisfactory.   RC stuff (mainly work prints) get 10 minutes in
a tray washer and then flopped out to dry on a screen.  Not interested in
permenance here though.  

Best Regards,
     Howard F. Efner

  David Vestal has written that even with a wash of several hours he
couldn't see any difference in brightness, so perhaps it isn't a problem at
all with modern papers.
  Perhaps someone who has a reflection densitomer could test....

It should be OK. 
 An alternative process which may have merit is to use a two bath fixing
procedure with a holding wash inbetween the two baths. Essentially, the
paper is fixed after the first bath. The second insures the fixing process
is completed. The holding bath does no harm and extends rthe life of the
second bath. By giving a final fixing to all paper at once some control is
had of the degree of washing so that some prints will not be washed much
longer than others. The washing of the prints in the holding bath is
somewhat affected by hypo carried over into the bath with each print. 
  After the second fixing the prints are rinsed, treated with wash aid and
given the final wash.
  The fact is I don't know if this makes a big difference. There are lots
of prints of 50 or more years of age which are perfectly fine despite going
through routine processing at a photofinisher, I think its possible to get
too fussy. I am convinced, however, that insuring complete fixing by a two
bath method has more effect on permanence than almost anything else.
 Ten minutes is the Kodak recommendation for single weight so should be
enough.
  The tray siphon should be set for a fairly high flow. If you fix several
sheets at once a lot of hypo is going to diffuse into the water, especially
at first so the flow rate should be fairly high. It sounds like you are
keeping the prints separated in the tray. That is important since they will
tend to stick together despite the turbulance of the water flow. Keeping
the sheets separated is the main virtue of so called archival print washers.
  I have, BTW, checked the flow rate of a Kodak Tray Siphon using a dye
(actually beet juice) to see how long it would take to become invisible in
a 16x20 tray. It is about 3 minutes at a moderate flow rate. Not bad.

Test.
Test for residual fix. 
Test for residual silver.
Test for residual Hypo clearing agent.
Light Impressions used to sell a great test kit for photographs. 
It consisted of four pens. Three to test for the above conditions and a 
final pen to test for Ph. The Ph test pen was also good for leaving a 
small blue mark on the back of the mat to make sure the storage 
conditions were acid free as well as the mat- it would turn green if 
exposed to acid conditions.
Unfortunately they don't seem to offer any but the Ph pen anymore.
The Formulary however does offer tests for these conditions. You should 
run through the tests at least once. 
Years ago I was pleasantly surprised to find that my washing procedure 
with that particular water supply was more than necessary and I was able 
to cut back on water usage considerably. This was in southern California 
during  a water shortage. I now live in a different city with very 
different water and temperatures and have retested and readjusted my 
procedures. I test once or twice a year to be reasonably  sure.

I've seen other recommendations that sound as if they use 
surprisingly small amounts of water. For example, washing film in a 
Patterson tank, with only a single complete replacement of water in 5 
minutes (120ml/minute.) In the above Kodak recommendation, there 
isn't even a full replacement of water. For example, if I use a tray 
that holds 3.5 liters of water (an 8x10 tray,) the rate should be 0.7 
liter (0.18 gallons) per minute, or a total of 3 liters of water 
used. That is much less than flushing the toilet (which uses 1.6-7 
gallons; some people use that to flush out a single tissue that they 
wiped their nose with.) However, I don't think you can run for 
example a Kodak siphon that slow. Perhaps the critical thing is how 
long one keeps the film/paper submerged in water (with any 
agitation/inflow of fresh water), not the rate of the flow.

BTW, the recommendation is that if multiple sheets are washed in an 
archival washer, you should start timing when the last sheet goes in. 
But washing relies on the relative difference in concentration, and 
if I have a washer that holds for example 100l of water, and insert a 
sheet that would add say 0.01 liter of fixer, then we're talking 
about 0.01% change in concentration of the wash water, which should 
be magnitudes less then the concentration in the paper until the 
washing is finished.

I believe your decimal point is in the wrong place- most municipal water
supples flow at the 1/2 to 2 1/2 gal per minute range, so I bet yours is
1.1 gal min. unless you are at the firestation.......
4 minutes at this rate is plenty- use a hypo clearing agent before
washing.

What's the rationale for this?
I use hypo clear with film and also on the rare occasions that I use RC 
paper. I thought it was a simple base/salt solution that works pretty 
much like soap to help rid paper fiber and gelatin emulsions of fixer.  
With fiber paper I sometimes even use hypo eliminator in addition to the 
hypo clear.

I've got to tell you that I use perma-wash with my RC prints (and sometimes even 
selenium toner which tones MGIV beautifully).

In terms of a darkroom workflow, it is incredibly impractical to keep wet times 
to the 5 minute or whatever is recommended for RC.  I merely accumulate these in 
a tray of water over the two or so hours I work and finish washing and 
squeegying them as a batch.  The worst damage seems to be the corners.  Quite 
frankly, if I couldn't use this darkroom regimen I;'d just as soon go back to 
single-weight glossy paper and ferrotype tins - the way I grew up making work 
prints.  I really would'nt obsess over either the use of hypo clear OR 
extended wash times.  Neither seems to be a critical issue for work prints and I 
probably use more plastic than anyone else I know: about 2000 per year.

Curt

Because it does no good at all, and extends the wet time of the print which

  Wash aid is usually not recommended for RC paper because it isn't
necessary for normal washing. The emulsion is thin and washes out quickly. 
  Wash aid or a carbonate or Kodalk bath may be helpful for toning in
Selenium toner or toners like Kodak Poly Toner and Agfa Viradon, which are
combination toners containing Selenium. The alkali or wash aid bath
prevents the carry over of any acid to the toner which may result in a
yellow stain from elemental Selenium deposited on the print. Kodak Hypo
Clearing Agent leaves prints and films at neutral pH. Hypo Clear is similar
but not the same. I think it contains ammonium sulfite rather than sodium
sulfite.
  Total wet time for RC can be pretty long with modern papers. Half an hour
or even more should do no damage. The problem of chemicals creeping into
the edges is a bit exagerated. 
  As far as emulsion lifing it takes rather warm water to do that. Its a
useful trick for making paper negatives without the paper.

Sounds interesting. I've done emulsion lifts from polaroid prints but
never tried this from conventional RC printing paper. How hot does the
water have to be, and does all RC paper work? Do you get a similar
effect as with polaroid emulsion, in which the gel layer floats off and
can be repositioned on art paper?

Thanks
