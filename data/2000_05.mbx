Ditto: I just tinished a book about rice culture in the Philippines and my
main camera was the original Mamiya 7 with the 43mm, 65 and 80 lenses. Like
others on the list I found the system to be lightweight, quick and extremely
sharp. In particular the 43 is an awesome lens. Unfortunately, the meter was
almost unusable, particularly with that 43mm lens. After the first few rolls
I started using a handheld meter. I had hoped that Mamiya would have
addressed this problem with the Mamiya 7 II but I guess not.

Andrew
In the workshops I give, we usually start practical work by comparing the
meter readings of all participants off a common subject, usually a grey
card, under the same even lighting. The normal 'spread' of readings is 4 to
5 stops. Comparing readings from my Canon Eos 600 a few years ago from a
more-than-frame-filling grey card on an evenly lit north facing wall - I got
a one stop difference simply switching from 'spot' to 'average' metering!
The need to cancel out all variations in equipment performance and
processing technique by conducting personal film speed tests is obvious.
Even this does not take account of the differing variations obtained by
different meters at different lighting levels (bright, dim etc.), or
differing reactions to colour.
No, you are not being paranoid!

Robert
No arguments with your costing - but you will need to include the cost of
distilled, not purified or deionised, water in the PMK formula. The reason
so many people have a problem in mixing PMK, and, I suspect, why some
commercially supplied PMK doesn't actually conform to the published formula,
is that it is very difficult to get the Sodium Metaborate into solution in
part B. This demands distilled water I find, which is relatively expensive
in the UK. I buy it in bulk for my processing activities anyway.
Home mixers of PMK can manage with purified water, but may need to mix part
B in, say, double the amount of water; then double the amount mixed into the
working solution i.e. 1:4:100 instead of 1:2:100. I prefer to get the
formula right though.

Thanks Barry for your prompt reply. Its not the difference in actual =
readings that's the problem, I would  overcome that I think with a few =
tests. What has got me puzzled is the interpretation of the readings. If =
I set my (any ?) spot meter to say 400asa &  get a reading of EV  10 I =
will get a set of values that are usable for that light level. If I set =
the same on a handheld meter the values given for the same EV will be 2 =
stops more. This is completely ignoring any light reading, just setting =
a given EV on the meter. This is the bit that has got me puzzled, not =
the variations in readings from 1 meter to another.
Really that does not matter either, you would soon learn to adapt too =
it, but why is it there a difference? Surely an EV on any meter should =
always give the same set of values relative to the read value. Or have I =
got a meter with a strange scale?

  In the workshops I give, we usually start practical work by comparing =
the meter readings of all participants off a common subject, usually a =
grey card, under the same even lighting. The normal 'spread' of readings =
is 4 to 5 stops. Comparing readings from my Canon Eos 600 a few years =
ago from a more-than-frame-filling grey card on an evenly lit north =
facing wall - I got a one stop difference simply switching from 'spot' =
to 'average' metering!
  The need to cancel out all variations in equipment performance and =
processing technique by conducting personal film speed tests is obvious.
  Even this does not take account of the differing variations obtained =
by different meters at different lighting levels (bright, dim etc.), or =
differing reactions to colour.
  No, you are not being paranoid!

  I recently bought a pentax digital spot meter. The 1 I have had for =
years, an old Pentax seemed really large & hard to read when I compared =
the 2. When I did compare the 2 it was pretty obvoius that it was giving =
a false reading, & overexposing by about 2 stops. No problem when I took =
in back, but we decided to compare it agaianst other handheld meters in =
the shop. It soon became apparent the the 2 do not really compare. 2 =
completely different readings for the same EV value

  I went home, pulled out a Lunasix 3 & an old Weston both with =
instruction books, & same for the Pentax spot. All books say they are =
reading to give an EV value. But it the same EV value is set on a spot =
meter & on a handheld meter you obtain 2 different readings. Does one of =
the meters read something entirely different? If so what would you set =
as a EV value on a Hasselblad or similar? How do you relate the 2? Am I =
just being paranoid?

I don't understand the distinction you've made in these messages between =
a "spot" meter and a "hand held" meter. Many spot meters are hand held =
(e.g. the Pentax, the Minolta). Are you talking about in camera meters =
vs. separate meters or are you talking about spot vs. averaging, or =
what? It would be easier, for me at least, to understand the problem if =
I understood the terminology.

    I recently bought a pentax digital spot meter. The 1 I have had for =
years, an old Pentax seemed really large & hard to read when I compared =
the 2. When I did compare the 2 it was pretty obvoius that it was giving =
a false reading, & overexposing by about 2 stops. No problem when I took =
in back, but we decided to compare it agaianst other handheld meters in =
the shop. It soon became apparent the the 2 do not really compare. 2 =
completely different readings for the same EV value

    I went home, pulled out a Lunasix 3 & an old Weston both with =
instruction books, & same for the Pentax spot. All books say they are =
reading to give an EV value. But it the same EV value is set on a spot =
meter & on a handheld meter you obtain 2 different readings. Does one of =
the meters read something entirely different? If so what would you set =
as a EV value on a Hasselblad or similar? How do you relate the 2? Am I =
just being paranoid?

Hi Andrew,
I think the problem is that not all those numbers on meters that look
like EV's are really EV's. For example, an instruction book for an older
Pentax Spotmeter states "This scale (L.L.) should not be confused with
the EV or Exposure-value system used on some cameras and shutters...
There may be instances when the values, because of a certain combination
of the variables of light and film spped of the film you are using,
would result in the L.L. number being the same as an EVS number; however
this would be purely coincidental."

Sorry Brian, perhaps it's me. I tend to call an ordinary separate meter, =
not in camera, as a hand held meter. I refer to 1 that will give an =
incident or reflected light reading such as the Westons and Gossens, =
with a usual acceptance angle of about 30 deg. A spot meter is one =
capable of giving a spot reading, usually 1 deg. I realise they are both =
hand held, but not sure how you differentiate between them?

      I recently bought a pentax digital spot meter. The 1 I have had =
for years, an old Pentax seemed really large & hard to read when I =
compared the 2. When I did compare the 2 it was pretty obvoius that it =
was giving a false reading, & overexposing by about 2 stops. No problem =
when I took in back, but we decided to compare it agaianst other =
handheld meters in the shop. It soon became apparent the the 2 do not =
really compare. 2 completely different readings for the same EV value

      I went home, pulled out a Lunasix 3 & an old Weston both with =
instruction books, & same for the Pentax spot. All books say they are =
reading to give an EV value. But it the same EV value is set on a spot =
meter & on a handheld meter you obtain 2 different readings. Does one of =
the meters read something entirely different? If so what would you set =
as a EV value on a Hasselblad or similar? How do you relate the 2? Am I =
just being paranoid?

Andrew,

The Pentax Meter operates slightly different than many other meters.  What
is called EV numbers on the Pentax Digital Spot is really EV at 100ASA.
I.e. the 100 ASA is assumed in the EV value.  You take into account the
actual ASA on the mechanical calculator ring on the front of the meter.
On most of the more electronic meters (i.e. Minolta and builtin camera ones)
you set the ASA electonically and the actual ASA is used to get the EV
value displayed.  So comparing the EVs from the Pentax with a Minolta
set at 400ASA will show a 2 stop difference.  After calculating the
actual exposure -- shutter and aperture -- you ought to get the same
result except calibration issues.

Roy
-----------

What has got me puzzled is the interpretation of the readings. If I set
my (any ?) spot meter to say 400asa &  get a reading of
EV  10 I will get a set of values that are usable for that light level.
If I set the same on a handheld meter the values given for the same EV
will be 2 stops more. This is completely ignoring any light reading,
just setting a given EV on the meter. This is the bit that has got me
puzzled, not the variations in readings from 1 meter to another.
Really that does not matter either, you would soon learn to adapt too
it, but why is it there a difference? Surely an EV on any meter
should always give the same set of values relative to the read value. Or
have I got a meter with a strange scale?

  I am getting into this thread late.  How did you compare the meters?  A
standard type meter has a rather large acceptance area and averages the
light from everything it sees. The spot meter also reads the value of what
it sees. If the two read exactly the same thing they should read the same.
In practice that means reading something with an extended, evenly
illuminated area which will fill the acceptance angle of the standard
reflectance meter. Reading any spot on that area with the spot meter should
result in the same reading. 
  A spot meter is used to calculate the final exposure by taking readings
of the lightest and darkest areas and doing your own averaging. The
advangate of the spot meter is that it can be used for measuring the
"contrast" or lighting ratio of the scene. An ordinary reflectance meter
can also do this but only if it can be used close up. The spot meter can
make the readings at a distance.  The reflectance meters (and a spot meter
is a reflectance meter) and incident meters should agree fairly closely
when the reflectance meter is reading an extended 18% reflectance card.
Some caution needs to be applied when using an 18% gray card. Most are too
small, most are not very good diffusers. The theory assumes the 18% card is
a perfect Lambertian surface, most are pretty far from that. Also, most 18%
gray cards have considerable specular reflection which will give a very
false reading.
  BTW, I've found Weston meters have too large an acceptance angle. They
must be used with some caution outdoors if they are not to be fooled by
skylight.

Andrew:  Following the thread so far - I have a Pentax Digital spot meter
and the numbers that it generates are the same as and EV assuming an 100
speed film.  The actual exposure calculation it taken care of using the
front ring where the film speed is factored in to get an actual exposure
reading.  Other meters should agree if the ISO speed is set to 100. Have
done that excercise with a Hassy metered prism (calibration was high by one
stop or so), reflected and incident meters and several camera meters.  As it
has been stated, most of the camera and other meters will factor in film
speed and give a number that can be used directly for exposure settings.
There may be( probably is) a calibration error in any meter tested.  My
digital was off on the high end but was close in low light levels- a
linearity (span) error rather than a zero error.  There are repair shops out
there that will so calibrations and the $&#@*($#& meters will drift off over
time.

I'm confused by the statement in this message, and in the previous message
concerning the same subject, to the effect that the numbers generated by the
Pentax digital spot meter are "true" EV numbers only when  the meter is set
to 100 ASA. I have a Pentax digital spot meter and when I aim it at a
particular area I get the same EV reading regardless of what ASA number I
use. In other words, the ASA number set on the meter isn't affecting the EV
number. shown by the meter.  This indicates to me that, contrary to the
statements in the two messages, the number generated by the meter is a
"true" EV number. Am I incorectly interpreting the two messages or
misinterpreting what the meter is telling me or am I missing something else?
Thanks.

P.S. I'd like to thank everyone who responded to my inquiry of a few days
ago concerning alternatives to a dark cloth. I responded personally to most
of them but several were inadvertantly erased before I replied so I'll thank
those persons here. All of the responses were useful and I'm pursuing
several of the alternatives suggested.

Someone correct me if I am wrong but I beleive what should have been said is
that when the meter is set to an ISO of 100 then the EV numbers displayed
represent luminance values (lux per square meter or candles per square foot,
I can't recall). This is true for all meters not just Pentax -- I think.

I think the confusion arises because of the usage of the term EV.  EV
stands for Exposure Value and "true" EV is just a measure of how much
exposure is given to some film.  Its defined as EV = 0 means 1 second
at f/1 and each number higher is one stop less exposure.  Eg. EV = 10
means ten stops less or 1/15 sec at f/8 or any other combination with
the same exposure.  For most people EV numbers are just intermediate
numbers on the way to calculating a shutter and aperture, but for 
Hasselblad lenses you can directly set the exposure by EV number and
easily cycle thru equivalent shutter/aperture combinations.  For this
situation you need "true" EV numbers that depend on the ASA of the
film you are using.  The Hasselblad meter prism as well as the
Minolta Flash Meter work this way.  On both of them you must set the
ASA and it is incorporated into the EV calculation.

Your observation about the Pentax Digital Spot is entirely correct.
It reads the same numbers regardless of the ASA wheel on the front.
So these numbers are not what you'd call "true" EV numbers because
you must factor in the film speed later on to get the actual
exposure.  The Pentax numbers will be identical to the Minolta EV
numbers if you set the Minolta meter to ASA = 100, so the Pentax
numbers are really EV at 100ASA.

Personally for my large-format black & white I prefer the Pentax
because it just measures light intensity and I do all the exposure
calculation using my own tested ASA, filter factors, bellows factors.
For incident meter readings and a Hasselblad, the Minolta meter
makes for an extremely convenient transfer of one number from tbe
meter to the lens.  So each system has its strengths, its just too
bad that the EV term is so loosely thrown around.

This interesting thread says a great deal about the various periods when
members learned the black (and white) arts of photography. It is
understandable that one who learned photography in the 89's and later using
automated cameras would be unfamiliar with EVS and mand held exposure
meters.

EVS (Exposure Value System) was a "feature" incorporated in many cameras
and exposure meters during the 1950' and 60's. The idea was to take a light
meter reading and note the EV of the light, usually a number between 5 and
17, then set the lens and shutter combination to that number. The aperture
and shutter adjustments were then locked together in inverse relationships
that would always yield the same exposure value of illumination on the
film. For example, EV 10 was 1/15 at f8, or 1/30 at f5.6 or 1/60 at f4,
etc. Selection of the appropriate pairs depended on DOF and motion
concerns.

Like many others who learned photography as a teen in the dark ages I
prefered to set aperture and shutter myself. I still ignore the EV scale on
meters and read shutter and aperture values.

I recently traded off a nice 1957 Voigtlander Vitessa because the mandatory
EVS locking of exposure pairs was a major irritation to adjust. I swapped
it for a 1948 Cannon II Leica copy that has no such frills. Fortunately, my
1953 Rolleiflex MX-EVS-1 has an EVS system which allows easy over-ride of
the lock.

Autoexposure systems made EVS irrelevant on AE cameras. Other than a few
Hasie lenses, I don't think any pro grade cameras still burden the user
with EVS.

Interesting.  I have the exact opposite take on this.  I used Mamiya TLR's 
for about 35 years, and routinely set my speeds and apertures independently - 
occasionally with screw-ups, when I wanted to change the DOF or the speed, to 
suit the subject.  Now I have a Hassie C/M, with all of the old "C" lenses, 
and wouldn't give up the joys of the interlocked speed/EV rings for all the 
advantages of the newer CF/etc. lenses.  I can still change the interlock 
quickly, if desired, but I won't inadvertently  alter the EV unless I want 
to.  Life is so much easier now.  Viva la "C" chrome lenses.

silver folk -

Be aware that a very nasty virus is out and about today.  If you
see an email with subject/content along the lines of
"I LOVE YOU", do NOT open it or run the attachment - very nasty
things will happen to your machine.

Existing anti-virus software does not yet detect this.

I realize this is not a normal part of this email list's
charter, but I wanted to warn you all so as to avoid the
suffering I am now undergoing in rebuilding my primary
WinDoze machine...

Best,

I had the I love you virus long before I had a computer, but I think I've
got antibodies now.

Its worth pointing out that if you never open/run attachments from people
you dont know, you will never get a virus through email. Most of these
email virus warnings are hoaxes, and the warnings themself constitute the
virus.

Wayne,

My warning came from my ISP (execpc here in Milwaukee) just a minute or two
before Tim's advisory came through.  Sounds real enough to me...

I got the warning through a gov. agency I work for too. This has all the
earmarks of a very succesful hoax. As I said, if you dont open unknown
attachments you cant get a virus from email, so these warnings are just
like saying "DONT OPEN UNKNOWN ATTACHMENTS", which is a policy everyone
should already know and be following regardless.

This is definitely NOT a hoax - it is true that you have to open
the attachment (which I normally NEVER do, but in this case I
had a brain malfunction and clicked w/o thinking).  This particular
little nasty exploits the services of the Windows Scripting Host
for Visual BASIC to rename files and load them with its own little
special version of nastiness.  This is quite real - you can
tell if you are infected by seeing if your .BMP and .JPG files
have been renamed to .BMP.vsh and .JPG.vsh respectively.

Wayne,

I must point out that not all virus' come as visible attachments. The Kak
Worm virus is invisible to anybody, comes through HTML format e-mail (which
is good enough reason to only use plain text formatting!!) and will totally
screw up your system. I know, I got it from another list and had to
re-format.

Best wishes,

Julian Smart.

Ok, so I was wrong, insert foot in mouth. Wont be the last time. ;-) I get
so many of these warnings and few of them ever turn out to be anything. I
never open attachments from people I dont know, so I just dont worry about
these things much. 5 years of internetting and no viruses yet (I'm sure
I'll wish I hadnt said that).

    Its visible on mail readers which show only plain text. This is a 
script which runs in Microsoft Outlook Express. News readers like Outlook 
which can run scripts automatically should be set to turn off that feature. 
In general, especially when posting to a mailing list, all formatting 
(HTML, etc) should be turned off so that messages are sent in plain text only.
    BTW, I just installed the new version of Eudora. If you have the older 
version of Eudora Lite and are thinking about upgrading to this thing I 
advise against it.

Miles and miles from photography...why you don't like Eudora 4.3? I
downloaded it but a little voice warned me off installing. Is it no good
even in Light Mode?

Is this another "feature" of Outlook Express or can it infect other e-mail 
clients as well?

Better still, all messages to anybody should sent in plain text only!  HTML 
in email is just a waste of time and bandwidth.

Well, two days ago I would have agreed wholeheartedly Richard, I had awful 
problems with it at first.  However, now I've got them sorted I think I'll 
stick with it because it does have many useful features.  Rather than let 
it install itself over your old version, install it into a new directory 
and let it create a new eudora.ini file.  This speeds it up immensely.  You 
can simply copy your old mailbox files into the new directory when you're 
happy with it.  It's a far more useable e-mail client than the horrid mess 
that is Outlook Express (just my opinion :-) ) and much less subject to the 
sort of virus attacks we saw yesterday. Although unfortunately it sets 
itself up in HTML mode this can be turned off.  SInce this is very much OT, 
anyone who wants more info is welcome to contact me off list.  Tim - I hope 
you've been able to repair the damage OK.

Best
Richard

   Lou and Lee, this is just what I mean. First, you can not install it as 
Eudora Lite, you must install the entire program, its huge. You can choose 
which mode to run it in from the "Help" file. However, when run in the Lite 
mode all the other junk is still there.
   When run in the advertising mode the left quarter of the screen becomes 
a screen for ads. The program downloads ads each time you use it. The ad 
cache would eventually become very large if you don't go into it and 
manually delete the ads.
   Also, although it seems to filter mail more quickly it does everything 
else slowly.
   Also, in my installation the "Blah Blah" button, which is supposed to 
display complete headers is on all the time and has to be clicked to get it 
off, really annoying.
   I think Qualcomm wants to stop distributing free Eudora and get everyone 
to cough up fifty bucks for the paid version. I think I still have a copy 
of the old Eudora Lite and may try re-installing it. The problem is that I 
don't know if the new program has modified the stored mail files. I can get 
them into transferred after an un-install by saving them to a Zip drive and 
reinserting them in the old program. This thing is a mess.  There is 
something very different about the personality of the program and the 
promotion for it. I wonder if Qualcomm hasn't replaced a manager or some 
exutive with a "modern" profit at any price type.
   I may have to switch to Outlook Express as much as I would hate to. 
Qualcomm does't seem to realize that everything they want you to pay fifty 
bucks for is available free from either Microsoft or Netscape.

   The recent "viruses" like Kak Worm and this thing are actually short 
Visusal Basic scripts. The problem with Outlook Express is that it can run 
them.  I am not sure what the point of this was but Microsoft evidently 
thought it was a desirable feature. So, one can write a little basic 
program which will tell the computer to screw itself up royally and send 
the same scrip on to every other computer it talks to.
   If your e-mail software does not run scripts you are safe. The worm will 
appear as either text in the message or as an attachment which can be deleted.
   Outlook can be set up so that it neither decodes or runs scrips 
automatically. Evidently, it is set up to do both by default when it is 
installed.
   You are relatively immune from this sort of worm is you don't run Visual 
Basic scripts automatically or you have some operating system other then 
Windows95/98/NT

      Well, with your prompting I fixed the all headers all the time

Dear Wayne,

After being a member of the Urban Legends forum group for a couple of years, I too have a tendency to discount all multiple VIRUS warnings. But after my own embarrassing post, I have learned to "check
it out first" with several virus and virus hoax web sites I've bookmarked. So, don't feel bad as I've also "been there- done that".

			yours a UB skeptic,

You shouldn't have a problem with getting to your mail files with an older version of Eudora, they are stored in a single text file with the name of folder 
that you store them in Eudora.

Don't try this with any of the Outlook products, I still haven't found
how or where they store the actual email.

There is unsurprisingly a lot of traffic in the comp.mail.eudora.ms-windows
newsgroup about how to get rid of all the irritations and sluggishness :-)
If you *do* revert to the previous version be aware that the new one by
default stores your outgoing msgs in HaTeMaiL even if you've set it to
"send plain text only".  You can disable this "feature" by the addition of
some lines to eudora.ini - which also gets rid of those stupid "excerpt
bars" and puts back the nice little > we're all used to for quoted
passages.  In addition, it further speeds it up.  Put the following in the
[settings] section of eudora.ini

AlwaysExcerptResponse=0
InterpretFormatFlowed=0
ConvertFormatFlowedtoExcerpt=0

Otherwise, there's no problem reverting to your old version though I advise
making a backup of the mailboxes anyway just in case.

> I may have to switch to Outlook Express as much as I would hate to. 

I had my first Outlook experience last night in an attempt to show some
friends who are new users how to delete the virus should they receive it.
Try as I may, I could not find where Outlook stores attachments.  At least
with Eudora, you get them all neatly placed into a folder where you can see
them and if necessary delete them. I personally consider the security risks
of using Outlook unacceptable and I won't let it, or IE, anywhere near any
of my PCs. I did try installing IE5 once, only to check that my website
displayed correctly in it, and it destroyed my Windows and System
directories necessitating, eventually, a new HD and a clean install of
Windows.  Had it not been for Quarterdeck Cleansweep and its ability to
undo some of the damage, I'd have been faced with a full restore from
backup tapes and been unable to do any work till it was done. Not very
impressive, Mr Gates ... 

Roll on Linux!

Thanks very much for your comments. I'm sure you know Lite 3.06 is still
available from Qualcomm, if that'll do for you. You are likely right that
they've completely succumbed to now fashionable bottom-line
nobody-doesn't-like-advertising thinking. Still, it was nice of Mr. Beckley
to give away his email program all these years. I'll skip 4.3 - even if it
can be made to work, I spend too much time modifying and fixing new
photography equipment to mess with computer programs, too ;)

While I'm aware of the rules of thumb for what size enlarging lens one needs
for a specific negative size, I'm not aware of how to derive it
mathematically. Does anyone have this equation?

Enlarging lenses may be different from taking linses.  There's no "normal" 
to me:  as long as it has the covering power to include all of the 
negative, it will work.  Assuming coverage, different focal lengths of 
enlarging lenses translate into different heights for the enlarging head to 
get a given print size.  Running out of enlarger height limits the print size.

For example, I'm tall enough to use a 150 mm lens for 6x6 cm negs.  I can 
still reach the controls to make an 11x14 print  ;-)   However, it is a 
stretch and I just bought a 75 mm lens designed to just cover 6x6 (51 deg 
included angle) so I can make 16x20 prints.

The same cone angle applies to other lenses of the same make, so the 80 mm 
covers 6x7 cm, the 150 mm covers 4x5 in., etc.  (El Nikors go up to 11x14 
neg size).

I am assuming that you would use the same formula that you would use to compute
the normal lens for a given format.  Basically you just measure the diagonal of
the format that you want to cover and use that for the normal.

For the life of me, I can't figure out what al the fuss is about.  To 
me, and i have been using Eudora exclusively for 7 years and find it 
much better in both ease of operation and user interface than Claris 
Emailer, netscape, or microsofts's email programs.  i used the lite 
versions for years but since my upgrade to an iMac at home and a G4 
at work, i went with the advertising version of Eudora and  to tell 
you the truth, i totally ignore the ads and would never buy anything 
form them.  Besides, even though i'm on a Mac and with all the 
problems lately with all the viruses geared toward Outlook, why use 
anything else?

Also,  what's the problem with paying for a program you use?  Does 
everything need to be free to be "worth" anything?  it's just like 
the film you use , the chemicals, the paper, etc. Should we expect 
the photo manufacturers to give us free chemicals if we use their 
film?

just a thought

That actually isn't a URL.  "aol" is not a standard transfer protocol
for use by web browsers.  This is actually AOL trying to stick to
their non-standard protocols and client programs.

The proper URL depends on how you want to read USENET news.  To read
the Dejanews archives you can start at <URL:http://www.deja.com/>.
Unfortunately Dejanews' current search method is pretty bad.  A search
of the web will lead you to better ways to search Dejanews.

To read USENET news directly with a news reader or web broswer you
need to point your client program at a NNTP (Network News Transfer
Protocol) server.  Your ISP will normally tell you the name of that
machine, or you can sign up with a news provider like Remarq.  In
Netscape Communicator you set this under
Edit->Preferences->Mail & Newsgroups->Newsgroup Servers.

Once you have found a NNTP server the URL for reading a newsgroup with
a web browser is of the form nntp:newsgroup.  For example
rec.photo.equipment.medium-format can be found at
<URL:news:rec.photo.equipment.medium-format>.  A news reader should
automatically be able to find any newsgroup the NNTP server carries
and provide you with a list to choose from.

By the way, the form <URL:{whatever}> (where {whatever} is a valid
URL) is the recommended way of quoting URLs in email and news
articles.  You don't type anything but {whatever} into your browser.
If your {mail|news} reader can handle embedded links they should be
able to deal with this form of URL quoting.

interested), I finally talked myself into a new toy.  What follows is
a quick review of the camera after shooting a half-dozen rolls of
E-6, C-41, and most importantly, Agfapan APX 100 (color is for
cartoons ;)
  
For the record: All my Hassy stuff was stolen in Spain this year -
before I replaced it (which I did do eventually), I rented a Mamiya 7
just to see if it suited me more than the Hassy (it didn't).  So, in
the last 2 months, I've used a Hassy, M7, and now, a Fuji 645 Zi so
this review is in a pretty good context of the current MF
state-of-the-art:
  
Ergonomics
  
 - Weight is terrific Shape and general control layout is fine, but
   unremarkable. The entire camera is "soft" - that is, all the exposure,
   ASA, modes, and so forth are set via the electronics and controls, not
   directly on the lens.  This is hard to get used to when you're used to
   exclusively manual cameras, but it's not the end of the world.

 - Whisper quiet and vibration free. Very well screwed together -
   definitely pro quality construction that should hold up well unless
   you're in the habit of dribbling your cameras off hard concrete floors
   or the like.
  
 Optics
  
 - In a word - "terrific" - I've blown up hand-held negs to 16x20 and
   the sharpness and tonal fidelity is outstanding.  Not quite up to
   the 'Blad optics, but close enough that you have to *really* look
   to see any difference - that may also be a rationalization to
   support buying enough Hassy gear lately at the cost of a small car
   - it *must* be better, right ;)

 - Zoom range is rather limited.  Think of it as a medium wide -
   normal zoom - there is effectively no real telephoto operation of
   any note Great for small groups, candids, and waist-height
   portraits.
  
 Meter
  
 - Surprisingly accurate.  Backlighting fools it, of course, but you
   can meter lock or use EV override to compensate.  Since the meter is
   centerweighted, I was successfully able to use it like a "wide" spot
   meter for zone exposure calculation with excellent accuracy.
  
 Flash
  
 - Surprisingly powerful for as small as it is.  It's not going to
   replace your Metz, but for grab shots, it seems more than adequate.
  
 Film Transport
  
 - Seems fine, though as a matter of taste I prefer manual film
 advance - why waste the battery on loading and moving film.  Oh well,
 the engineers at Fuji didn't check with me first, sigh ;)
  
 Autofocus
  
 - Fast and accurate for handheld stuff - I set things manually when
   doing "serious" work, more out of habit than necessity.
  
 Best & Worst
  
 - I love the built-in diopter correction, but wish they had made it a
   little harder to change since it keeps slipping out of the desired
   position when I stuff the camera into the bag.  A small thing.

 - I love the ability to imprint the film edge with exposure and date
   info.  Unfortunately, this barely shows up with B&W - you have to use
   loupe to see it whereas it sticks out more in color since it is
   imprinted in red.

 - The disease of all RF cameras - no depth of field preview.  You'd
   think that in a totally "soft" camera they could have displayed the
   DOF digitally in the viewed display.  Not a small thing and an area
   that Fuji could really have distinguished this camera if the feature
   were present.  The camera "knows" where it is focused and what the
   f-stop is - why not have the computer lookup DOF out of a built-in
   table and display it I ask you?

 - I want more zoom

 - Lens is a little slow for slower films if you're gonna shoot
   handheld.  It is fine with the more speedy color emulsions.

 - It is so light and small (lighter than say, a Nikon F5, by a bunch)
 that you tend to drag it around with you much moreso than you would a
 Hassy or Bronica or Pentax 645...  This means you take more
 pictures... this is a very good thing.
  
 All in all, I love this thing.  It will never replace my 'Blad or 4x5
 but it has made my 35mm camera essentially obsolete (anyone wanna buy
 a beautiful vintage Nikon F with a working FtN meter and lenses?)
 It's not cheap, but you're buying pro gear here.  Its natural niche
 is probably for street shooters and wedding photographers, but it
 makes an awfully nice point-n-shoot for the serious photographer.
 I'd also highly recommend it for *beginners* who can have a camera
 that makes real negatives for less than the price of a pro 35mm SLR
 body alone.
  
 Questions, comments, rebuttals welcome...

Over the last 3 years, I have had 4 prints returned to me.
All were made in the period 1978-1979.  All were dry
mounted on archival stock and all were processed 
archivally.  From my records, they all were made on 
IlfoBrom Grade 2 Glossy 11X14 and 16X20 double
weight paper.  All were selenium 'toned'.

The problem with the prints is the appearance of small
(from about .1mm to .5mm) specks of emulsion flecking off.  
There is no yellowing of print or mount.  All of these were 
displayed continuously for the entire time.  Other mounted 
copies of these same prints stored in the dark show now
sign of the disease.

Any ideas what might be the cause?
--on display rather than archivally stored
--I used to squeegee the prints before screen drying.  Could
this cause 'stretching' of the emulsion.  After I switched in the
mid 80's to non-hardening fixer, I have stopped squeegeeing
--bad paper

This is a very small percentage of my work.  I'm pleased the
owners have bothered to track me down after all these years
-- it means they like the work.

Thanks for any enlightenment.

Dennis,  I would be suspect of two things, the harding fixer and continuos
display. If the gelatin is harden and then subjected to heat and cooling
with change in humidity, the print is likely to be distressed.  I would
recommend that your clients move your work out of climates that are subject
to a change it heat and humidity.

I know this contradicts other suggestions- I had a similar problem with 
Ilford multigrade about 2 years ago.It was because I used a nonhardening 
fixer and then an extended wash time. Ilfords comment when I pointed out 
that the same problem didn't occur with Oriental or Agfa papers and they 
said," Let's just say this is an area where our papers could be more 
robust..." So I add a small amount (less than recommended on the label) 
of hardener to the rapid fix for the Ilford papers my clients request. ( 
And I print my own work on Oriental and Bergger)

   I think this does not have to do with hardening or not of the emulsion. 
It sounds like the problem originates with the baryta layer. This is the 
substrate for the emulsion, it is made of one or more coats of very hard 
gelatin with a dispersion of Barium Sulfate in it.
   It would be interesting to know if the flaking is emulsion only of if 
both the emulsion and baryta coating are coming off together.
   The reason the displayed prints are suffering is that they are being 
subjected to varying amounts of humidity and possibly to polutants in the air.
   If the prints were subjected to a very long wash, like the sort of 
overnight soaks that used to be recommended some years ago, the binding of 
the baryta to the paper may have been compromised by it. Fiber paper, and 
for that matter RC paper, will take quite long wet times but the sort of 
very long washes once thought necessary for permanence did damage to both 
paper structure and to the coatings.

Would you say this is still the case with today's papers?  What are the
outside limits for wet time in your opinion, Richard?  I ask because
sometimes I will, after an evening of printing, finish washing the group of
prints the next morning....

Thanks for your thoughts!

Subject: Re: print emulsion flecking off


Thanks Richard and others for your responses.

How would I determine if the emulsion and baryta are coming off
together?  I still have 2 of the returnees.  I have looked at several
of the flecks with a loupe.  The 'front' side seems to have the tone
of the region from which they flecked and is shiny.  The 'back' side
seems very slightly lighter, certainly not pure white and is duller.
The
flecks are pretty small, so I could easily be wrong.  The area from
which the flecks came seems very white and may be shiny.  Would
the backside of the fleck be pure white if the baryta were attached?
I'll try to corral some of the flecks and scare up a microscope later
in the week.

My technique of the time (forgive my memory -- this was more than
20 years ago) included a maximum of 4 hrs total wet time I believe
-- the washes were not overnight.  I used 2-bath fixing setup in a
hardening fixer (definitely not Rapid Fix, but very likely Kodafix or
possibly EktaFlow(sp?) ) followed by a rinse then onto Hypo Elim
step, the batch washer, then KRST then more wash.

Richard, I suspect your surmise about the pollutants is correct -- all
were displayed in residences in the San Jose, California area (the last
several times I was there I can't remember a single instance of a clear
view of the Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton).  One had definite
odor of cigar.  Houses are also not known for particularly good
temperature or humidity control.

Thanks again.

Interesting...  I probably have almost 100 bottles of the hardener from
just the last year or two.  I do use the hardener for film.  As
mentioned
in the earlier response to Richard Knoppow's message, I was using
hardening fix at the time.  A very interesting "squeak when pushed"
admission from our friends in Paramus.  I print on Ilford now only
when doing RC because the batch to batch consistency seemed poor
on the FB, particularly toning response.

What do you consider an extended wash time?

Thanks.

Hi

I can vouch for the pollution.  We live in Santa Clara about 5 miles
north of San Jose.  Nice place to work and pleased to be here but just
like many metropolitan areas, the air is not exactly mountain fresh.  We
can see the Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton from our house (I guess
it must be approx. 30 miles away ?) but if you drive up to the mountains
either side of 'Silicon Valley' there is s definite yellow tinge to the
air.

Does anyone know if we should be concerned about fine art print ?

Regards
Malcolm (the other half of Sylvia)

I would be more concerned if you could live long enough to enjoy the print!!!

I have negative ion generators in my home in Phoenix, Az.  They are 
absolutely incredible for pulling the junk out of the air.... I bet framing 
with them in the studio could not hurt.....Just keep the generators away from 
computers.  The areas around the generators do get dirty...

   Normal wash times for double-weight unprotected (fiber) paper is about 
two hours with water at 68F or higher. Using a sulfite wash aid like Kodak 
Hypo Clearing Agent will reduce the time to about half an hour.
   The hypo in the emulsion washes out in a straight forward exponential 
manner due to diffusion. The hypo in the fiberous paper base does not. 
According to Ilford's research and earlier Kodak research the paper tends 
to hold the hypo by a sort of frictional force so it washes out much more 
slowly than is predicted by the simple diffusion model.
   There is also an effect when using a fixer with an alum hardener. The 
alum seems to act as a mordant, bonding the hypo the both emulsion and 
paper. The use of a sulfite wash aid breaks this bond by a sort of ion 
exchange process so that washing times when the wash aid is used are no 
longer whether the hardener is present or not.
   Note that this effect seems to be due specifically to the use of 
potassium aluminum sulfate harderer rather than to the acid in the fixer as 
is sometimes stated. Kodak labs found out many years ago that emulsions 
hardened in chrome-alum washed out just as quickly as un-hardened emulsions 
despite having a much lower pH than alum hardened emulsion.

    I suspect the problem with the flaking is due partially to some defect 
in the emulsion coating rather than the processing or mounting. I can't 
suggest a specific cause. There was a similar effect with early RC paper 
due to gasses produced by the decomposing of the Titanium dioxide in the 
plastic under the emulsion. The structure of "fiber" paper is quite 
different so Its not the same process. However, there may be something the 
prints were exposed to that had some similar effect.
    If the display area subjects the prints to large variations of 
humidity, or to very high humidity, it could be a cause.

     My bet is a combination of some defect in the coating at the factory 
and either high humidity or strong polutants in the display area.

      This does not seem to be a very common problem with fiber paper.

Now you can see why the confusion in Archival circles. That's why the only things I can say for sure are "archival wash" are my negatives.

Eric, I have now problem with your recent posting except-

>Garry, I don't see anything here that is confusing.

I began this "archival" tripping in 1969. Since then everything that was "good" then is BAD now. What was "bad" then is GOOD today. Long washes have become short. Sepia is now better than Selenium.
"Gold protection" is completely useless. Ilford is the experts, even when conserning Kodak products. Leave fixer in the prints? How much- who knows? Hardenning- depends on the material and/or who you
are talking too. That's the "confusion I'm referring too.

>Extended wash times or soaking prints can simply lift the emulsion off the >paper.

Yes. This has even happen to me in my  . One late night printing sessions too many and fell asleep . Although, it was with a batch of RC paper in my younger days and I never print more than I can wash
in a single night these days.

>As for the negative ion generator,

I considered one and then started to read of the "ozone" issue. A research project still on going with me and am not prepared to debate about.

 >I didn't see any questions regarding framing technique employed on these >prints?  Wooden or Metal frames? with proper backing?  Non archival
>mounting techniques can fail to properly protect the art work from the >environment that surrounds it.

No arguement here. An "archival print" is a result of it total synergistic enviroment. But unless you do it yourself, there is no controlling what a print will be subjected too after it leaves your
hands.

>Do you provide your customers with
>information about how to protect their investment?

As a matter of courtesy, yes I "advice" them how best to frame and/or display
there prints. But after that It is their fault if things go wrong. Although,
I'm not so hard as to not replace a print if my customer is civil about it.

	yours let's keep on looking for the silver/sepia/selenium/gold/platinum lineing,{:-})

Garry, I don't see anything here that is confusing.  My suggestion is grounded in this reasoning.  If you harden a gelatin and then subject
that to heating and cooling with changes in humidity, you will get expansion and contraction under a more rigid surface.  This happens every
day all around us.  Since the substrate of paper is not stable and I suspect a 4 ply board was used to mount it is also not stable, in that
they will move as they are subject to changes in humidity and temperature changes, what ever is on top of them will also move if possible.  I
didn't even mention the pollution which Richard brought up.  I was also thinking of spot lights that many people point at their prints on the
wall.  These can produce strong local heat.  I have seen where Cibachromes that were mounted on black plexiglas became delaminated, in part,
due to the heat softening the adhesive and lack of humidity.

Extended wash times or soaking prints can simply lift the emulsion off the paper.  It would follow that too much washing could weaken that
bond between paper and gelatin.  I have seen images almost completely wash off Brilliant paper back in the early 80's with on over night
wash.  The studio owner had a little too much wine with diner and forgot to walk down to his studio and when I got there in the morning, much
of the emulsion was floating in the print washer.

As for the negative ion generator, I have been using one since the late 70's and yes they can deposit dirt out of the air on the walls around
them.  It is a good idea to get one with a filter and fan.

I didn't see any questions regarding framing technique employed on these prints?  Wooden or Metal frames? with proper backing?  Non archival
mounting techniques can fail to properly protect the art work from the environment that surrounds it.  Did the flaking happen around the edges
or all over the place? I'm sorry that I deleted the original photographer's post that started this thread.  Do you provide your customers with
information about how to protect their investment?

Having grown up in the Santa Clara Valley, I can certainly see that these images could have been subject to large changes in heat and humidity
as the cool coastal evening bring much welcomed relief from the days heat.

So, if you weaken the bond of substrate and image, then subject it to unfriendly conditions, it is certainly possible that something may
happen down the line.

a few more thoughts,

EJ Neilsen

Ah yes, Much has indeed changed.  There have been many changes in the papers over the years and changes in philosophy. This is one reason that I do much of my personal work in platinum/palladium.  It was
also affected in the early to mid 80's by changes in paper.

Tim
About a year ago I bought a used Mamiya 6, and I am very pleased with it. It
is much lighter and easier to use than the Mamiya 645 I used before. I did
try a Fuji 645 and was very impressed. I agree with all that you say in your
review, but for me there is one problem with this camera: in order to take
landscape format you have to hold the camera in what would normally be
portrait mode.
I found this very awkward.

"Mode"???

Did you shoot the images with a horizontal or vertical composition?

I found that the vertical orientation of the GS645S camera frame when held
normally was quite convenient. Rotating it 90 degrees was no problem and
there was a second tripod socket on the end of the camera to accomodate that
position. My GSW690II is more of a handfull when tipped on end, however.

I can echo this - I shot *tons* of weddings and portraits with this family of
cameras with excellent results.  Hint: Try an old *chrome* 105mm lens for
portraits.  It is a bit soft and therefore perfect for face shots.


The one difference I would add is that the 330 is pretty heavy by comparison
to the 220 - Personally, I never found the automatic cocking all that
necessary.   These are just plain terrific cameras that are vasty underrated
in today's feature frenzy cameras...

I find myself shooting almost all of my work in vertical mode, or square.  I was
delighted the first time I picked up a Fuji and saw the upright viewfinder.  I
don't own one yet, but it's on my wishlist.  Does anybody know if there was ever
a 35mm camera that was set up that way?

        I think that the Mamiya C330/ 220 are great cameras.  They are the
unsung heroes of  medium format,  I did over 600 weddings with the pair of
C330's that I used to own and i only had one repair.   Yes,  the C220 is a work
horse of a camera.  The main difference between the 220 and 330 is that the 220
you have to cock the shutter on the lens manually.  Because of this the 220 is a
much simpler camera design.    The crank on the C220 actually winds the film.  I
have a pair of very old Mamiyaflexes, which is the same design as the C220 those
things would never die.  By now it is pretty obvious that I am a big fan of the
Mamiya

Ed, you could try a Rollei, Yashica, or Ricoh TLR with a 35mm adapter to
give you a vertical 36x24 format, or the neatest way might be an Olympus
Pen F or FT half-frame SLR with a vertical 24x18 format.

hello alexis !
As you may see from the headers of this Email, I use "free" software.
I think your comparison is not as good as it should.
I will compare it to using the brand of chemicals/papers/films from the
companies helping me to improve my skills for free.
And at that Kodak is a world champion. Their web site is really full of
documents for improving B&W printing, toning, testing for safelight
innocuity, and so on. At this, Fuji for example is not as good.
That I _do_ refuse is to pay a tax at a company putting potentially
dangerous stuff on their softs without saying anything to the customer.
The ability to embeed a Visual Basic script into an Email message and
have it executed upon mail opening is a nasty thing. The only known
usage is a virus called "ILOVEYOU" .....
This is why I do prefer free software (even if I've paid for (because
CDROM and distributions are not free...) on that matters see the share
prices of Redhat Inc. or Suse Gmbh)
But I think we are going far away the "Pure Silver" 
Best regards

	I recently ran across a rather intriguing analysis of lens/camera
performance in which a "cost per line of resolution" was derived.  The
Mamiya TLR's scored quite high (or should I say, "low?")
	http://www.hevanet.com/cperez/proposal.html
	I got into the system after determining that a medium format "portrait"
lens of 180mm would be cheapest in this system.  I haven't been
disappointed at all, and I love the 1/500 flash sync.
	I'm shooting with a C330.  Heavier and clunkier than my old C220, but
in the "heat of battle," doing wedding or jazz photography, I don't have
to take the extra step of lens cocking.  For me, it's better.  A more
deliberate style (landscape?), and it might not make a difference.  I
might not dare to say it on the Rollei list, but I feel the Mamiya grip
is a better design than the Rollei pistol grip, too.

If this is the same left-side-mounted grip that I once used on my old C2 and 
C3 Mamiyaflexes, I continue to use it - with a bit of modification - on my 
Hassy 500C/M.  It's a great grip !!

Thanks to you all for the information, comparison of the Mamiya cameras.

I want to take this moment to explain my occasional attitudes.

I am a heart patient with congestion that effects my patience; and my usual
computer time is spent with my wife and I in conversation at the same time.
She a retired actress and our discussions vary between what I'm writing at
the moment and other essays and fictions.  Including the portfolios in
progress.

With five large cameras and eleven lenses that she helped me to collect,
what do I have to complain about?  But, aparently you all do, occasionally;
so thanks and your participationis much appreciated through it all.

Steve Shapiro, Carmel, CA

Thanks to all who wrote with advice and info. about 220 film. I manged with 
some difficulty to track some down--(Tri X was the only kind available,)and 
put a roll through the camera. I found it quite straightforward but was 
surprised to find that it is more than double the price of a 120 reel--a 
pity, as I could see myself using it more often otherwise. I also tried 
putting 2x 120 films on one reel to develop together and again no problems 
and a saving on chemistry.Cheers, Saffron.

More questions...I would be interested to hear from anyone who uses a 
Polaroid back on a medium format camera. I may have the use of an RB 67 with 
one---I have never used one, or come to that, a Polaroid camera. I can see 
that it could be dead handy for checking composition, light etc. I have 
looked up the UK Silverprint catalogue and find a bewildering array of films, 
some with a negative. I am interested mainly in B&W but may also try colour, 
so any advice would be most welcome, both on films and use of the back.  
Saffron.

I have found this a great camera, really simple to use, not too large and 
heavy, easy to change lenses and excellent results. Cocking the shutter 
separately does not pose a problem as it is well situated on the left of the 
lens, easily to hand. I found the website recommended to me by a PureSilver 
listee very useful and informative. It' is 
www.btinternet.com/~g.a.patterson/m_faq.htm .All the best, Saffron.

Tri-X is not to be sniffed at (not that you did :>)).  Try souping it in
HC110, 1:31.  This is the way a lot of A. Adams' disciples did it.  With
those Zeiss lenses (lust, lust), a tripod, and mirror lockup, you should be
able to get knockout 16x20's.

Ilford HP5+ is readily available in 220 and is an excellent film I think.

Thanks, John,  I shall try HC110 next time.I usually use HP5 but love Tri X 
for certain effects and have had amazing results in Barry Thorntons' Dixactol 
with a russian arsat lens,135 film, handheld, but I can see your recipe for 
sucess would have certain advantages!  Saffron.

You will find HP5 and FP4 readily available in 220. I personally think HP5
Plus is now a superior film to Tri-X in most situations, and it certainly
performs outstandingly well in my own DiXactol or in PMK.
As I wrote in 'Elements', I do not believe that Tri-X in HC110 is a
particularly good combination, and moved away from it some10 years ago. For
'standard' developers, I think that both D76 and Xtol are superior, but you
have to mix them from powder. If you can stand the tiniest drop in speed,
dilute Perceptol or Microdol X  (1:2, or 1:3) are better still I think.

This is a copy of a letter I sent to "Professional Photographer" October =
1996.

It was published but no one ever shed light on the question. (!)

I've just repainted my darkroom matt-black. For decoration, I've made =
constellation patterns on the walls, using luminous stars (naff, but =
useful for depth perception).=20

'Charging up' the stars, using a mini ultraviolet lamp, I noticed =
glowing spots on the black work-surface. These turned out to be =
developer splashes (from clumsy handling). Tongs, clothing and hands =
showed similar spots. The inside of my chemical fridge looked like the =
Milky Way, with marks on the bottles and caps of Acutol, FX39, I1ford =
Multigrade and C41 developers.=20

Further experiment, using only 'black light' , showed the acid stop- =
bath change from invisible to a milky colour, then return to =
invisibility on lower pH , after agitation.

Is this high pH fluorescence documented in any common literature or is =
it of any serious practical use?

Whatever the outcome, it's certainly changed my cleaning and testing =
procedures.



After three years, I still use the technique to check stop-bath and =
cleaning efficiency.

Have the Pure Silver band any comments?

Hello


I went back to using 3.05, because after a while there was a blank screen
popping up every time I opened the program saying "Update Eudora".
Returning to the older version did not make any changes to the saved
messages, I believe.

I was told a long time ago that this information might work on the program.

first name: Pure
last name: Silver
serial: 57901413-64988208

Obviously, I have no need for this information any more.

One good thing with Eudora - most new vicious viruses that affect mail
programs are aimed at Microsoft Outlook.

I must say I'm not completely surprised at that pub's lack of response.   
Have you tried writing to Photo Techniques?  Dr. Robert Chapman, PhD in 
Photochemistry , writes a monthly Q&A column, "Photochemistry."   Address the 
question to him at PHOTO Techniques, PO Box 48312, Niles, IL  60714.  I have 
a subscription, and would be glad to keep a lookout for your letter in future 
issues.

   I believe there is a fix for this problem on the Eudora web site. The 
new version has lots of problems mainly due to the way its configured and 
to the fact than many configuration settings must be changed by editing the 
ini. file.
   Much of this stuff is in the tech support section of the Eudora home site.
   Also see the Usenet news group comp.mail.eudora.ms-windows  If you are 
running Eudora on a Mac see comp.mail.eudora.mac
   I am also considering going back to the earlier version. I don't need 
the features in the paid version, at least not fifty bucks worth, and find 
the screen limitation and advertising in the commercial version unacceptable.
  The problem is that you must have the complete program on your hard drive 
even though you are using it only in "Light" mode.
   Its too bad Qualcomm decided on this marketing ploy.

   Exactly which message and what did the virus program detect? If its the 
UV message it doesn't seem to contain a script or attachment.

It is a worm virus, which does not require an attachment file to infect your
computer.  I deleted it before even looking at it but the first name on the
sender is Robert,and thus do NOT open up any messages from a Robert for a
couple days.  The worm virus is a pain because you can be infected and then
send it out to others via email without even knowing you have done so.

I believe this was from Robert Slater and was a message entitled 'uvlight'.
 My copy simply had some computerese gibberish at the bottom -- one virtue
of EUDORA is that it tends to take these viruses, worms, &c and simply turn
them into harmless strings of garble.

Christina,

Since you ar e using Outlook Express you should have detected that the
message in question had an unsafe Active X control. If you didn't you might
want to change the Outlook configuration to do so.

A worm and a virus are really two different software entities. You may
recall the worm from quite a few years ago that brought the internet to its
needs. It affected servers running Unix and really didn't destroy the OS or
affect any users software. It replicated itself in memory until all free
memory was consumed. I can't recall exactly how the worm propagated itself
over the net but it wasn't via an e-mail attachment.

A virus is yet another software that "infects" programs that are run by the
system or the user. Some perdict that software viruses will be the death of
the internet as we know it now.

Happy hunting,

Don Bryant

I did detect it.

This is exactly the point:  the worm is not passed through attachments.
Hence, 'not opening attachments' is not going to protect us.

That is really a scary thought.  I posted the following  to the alt process
photo group that I am also on:   I was here, side by side, with my friend
who was visiting from CA,  the morning of the I LOVE YOU virus, watched her
open up her attachment, and watched her computer lock up and send 118
messages out to 118 unsuspecting people from her address book before she
could stop it.  It was incredible.  I also was online at the time, my
computer on a different phone line, and luckily because I saw her problem, I
avoided infecting my computer with the virus.  Considering my computer is
LOADED with photo files and MP3 files, it would've been bad (not disastrous
because I am backed up).  But the point i made to the alt list is that if I
did not see that in action, why wouldn't i have opened an attachment from my
friend who sends me an I LOVE YOU message???  And, of course, virus
protection on your computer is ONLY as good as what viruses have already
been discovered, not newly created ones.

Marc, That was the source.  I use Netscape and have only recently reloaded
McAfee because it would not scan my email messages.  It would only scan if I
was using outlook, (Thank you Dell).  Any way, McAfee deleted it before I had
see any portion of it.  I only caught a glimpse of the name.

Not being deeply into computers much of the discussion here goes by me but
it is worrying. If one gets a suspect email how is it possible to delete it
without opening it? I use Outlook Express and cannot find a way of deleting
without opening.

Also, how do you know in advance that a message is unsafe - as mentioned
below?

Finally, if I click on an attachment, I get a dialoge box suggesting that I
transfer it to a floppy. Is it then safe to open from a floppy disc?

I don't know - my only suggestion is *not* to use Outlook since 90% of 
these things seem to target it.

You don't.  But if your e-mail software is correctly configured it should 
never launch scripts or attachments without asking.

Probably not.

I see, using a text editor, that Robert's uvlight message does indeed have 
an embedded script which appears to be the KAK worm.  Details here:

http://www.symantec.com/avcenter/venc/data/wscript.kakworm.html

Again, Outlook users are most at risk.

I have looked at the message in question - I use Forte Agent, which will
not open HTML messages by default, so the HTML part of the message was not
opened. The last part of the HTML part of the message contained what
looked to me like a script, which among other things looks for
autoexec.bat, and invokes "regedit.exe", both of which looks like highly
suspicious activities to me. I haven't run it past a virus checker yet,
but I believe this to be a worm or a virus.

I firmly believe that HTML should not be used in e-mail, particularly
since such messages can function as carriers for viruses and worms. If
possible, I think it would be a good idea if the mailing list could be set
to strip HTML sections before passing messages on, or to return them to
the sender with instruction to turn HTML off in mails sent to the group.

I _do_ agree !
In my unix version, and with the netscape version I use, HTMLmail
messages are a _real_ pain. The font is less than 4 points high... And
it helps netscape to crash with a buss error more often than not. 
So Html mail is I think, more than an annoyance.

Richard, I noticed this morning an unfamiliar error message upon opening Win
98. It said something about KAK!. I rebooted and it did the same thing
again. Then I read mail and saw you comments and advice. I went to the
symantec link, the microsoft links and followed directions. Now the warning
message is not present. Does that mean I'm clean of the imunity to the
script virus? Is there an easy way to verify this?

Have I sent this virus to anyone? The KAK message just appeared this morning
and I have only sent this message to you and after doing the suggested
patch.

Thanks very much for posting the information.

Bill Lawlor

You can put a message in the delete box without opening it by having it
highlighted (single click) and then drag and dropping it into the delete
folder, then delete it.  I do that all the time.  You can tell if it works
because your "delete" folder will be bold print to show there is something
in there you haven't read.>

I have this old 5x7 enlarger... and when I print something that is 
16x20 or larger, I have a hard time reaching up to focus and seeing 
into the grain finder. My arm is too short. As it is...the grain is so 
fine I have never seen any, but I sorta' can find/see a sharper or less 
sharper image. But I never know if it's the sharpest it can be, because 
I cannot focus and veiw at the same time... Does anyone know of a 
company that makes a oversized grain finder/focusing veiwing 
tool/whatever that thing is called?? or have any other helpfull 
focusing tips?
thanks
garimo

Some I once knew had a similar situation . . . she purchased a thingamajig 
people in delis use to reach items on high shelves - a bit awkward, perhaps, 
but better than not being able to focus!

I opened this e-mail before I could find out who the "Robert" was who sent 
it.  Does anyone know whether AOL users have the potential to be infected?  
I'm completely unfamiliar w/"Eudora" some of you have mentioned, & I don't 
have McAfee, only  NAV.  Anyone have any wisdom to impart?  Any help would be 
appreciated.  Thanx.

Last I had a few problems loading a roll of HIE on the spool, and I
ended up with several shots sporting substantial fingerprints (The
FBI would be proud!). Naturally, the prints won't rub off with a
clean cloth.

Did I just lose the shots, or is there a cure for the fingerprint
disease?

I am not Howard Efner - I'm his daughter since he's gone on a photo shoot
(Lone Pine, CA.) Anyways, I was told to delete all PureSilver stuff that
didn't look that interesting when I read it. I have not read the Uvlight
message or it's reply.
Would the best response be to delete the reply as well as the affected message?
Thanks for your time,
                Louisa Efner

No, it doesn't work. I tried that - and again on getting your answer. As
soon as I depress the left button the message opens - even if I don't
release the button.
I also tried right click to try and delete that way. Same thing

I have a Patterson grain focuser that is 14'' high, as opposed to the usual
6" or 7".  It's called the Major Focus Finder, and B&H has them listed for
$42.

I have a Patterson grain focuser that is 14'' high, as opposed to the usual
6" or 7".&nbsp; It's called the Major Focus Finder, and B&amp;H has them
listed for $42.

On my 5x7, I just took a vinyl covered clamp, such as would be used to
attach a light to a table, and taped a yard stick (I suppose a meter
stick would work for those of you upon whom the EU has forced
metrification!) to one arm of the clamp. Once rough focused, the clamp
can be put on the focusing knob in a position to place the stick
conveniently near the easel.

The Saunders LPL 4x5 enlarger offers an optional extension to the focus 
knob, sold separately.  It consists of a cup that jams on over the existing 
knob (friction fit), a short flexible shaft, and a longer rigid shaft with 
another knob on the end.  It could be modified to fit other enlargers, I'd 
guess.

BTW, I have this old 5x7 camera with a portrait lens....

Can't find the BlahBlahBlah button on this Eudora.   Pure-Silver changes 
"from" address so without a signature your address isn't available to me.

Hi,

You need to fully open  the message, instead of it being split displayed 
below the list of incoming mail. The toolbar on the fully displayed message 
will have the blah blah button.

Hi all
I'm a new subscriber, arrived by way of the Camera & Darkroom mag in the =
UK.

I'm thinking of buying either a Pentax or Contax 645 system. I'm aware =
of the price and specification differences and amazed at the very low =
prices of the Pentax lenses.  Has anyone had actual practical experience =
with either camera that you may care to pass on?

Additionally I'd appreciate any good articles/discussion forum links you =
may know of. Thx

Olaf

There were three series of Fujinon enlarging lenses made and I always seem to 
confuse two of them.  The EX series is the latest 6 element design.  i have 
both a 135 and 75 and these lenses are superp.  I reach for them just as 
frequently as my Componon-Ss...I just don't see any difference.  The there were 
the ES and EP series.  One of these is a 4 element design and the other id a 
six and the predecessor to the EX.  The 6 element lens is superb.  I've read 
that the 4 is typical of 4-element designs, not up to the 6s.  I happen to love 
Fuji optics and also use them on my 4x5.  Good stuff.

The EP series was Fujinon's top enlarging lens until a few years ago.

The ES was a 4 elements in 3 groups lens and was described as their economy
lens.    At least for awhile, both the ES and EP series were simultaneously
available.   The EP has 6 elements in 4 groups.   From the Fujinon literature
that I have, it appears that neither the ES nor the EP were multicoated.

These were replaced with the EX series, of either 6 elements in 4 groups (50
and 75 mm) or 6 elements in 6 groups (90 and 135 mm).  This series has Fuji's
EBC multicoating.

Michael, I have a Beseler Color-Pro 90mm 5.6 enlarging lens that I suspect
might have been made by Fuji. Do you know anything about it? I think it is
superb. Also, I have used some older Fuji enlarging lenses that were
outstanding.

We have been using PANF in your Di Xactol in single bath mode and the
results are really special.  Fine grain, beautiful tonality and razor
sharp edges.  We took your advice of 7 minutes for 35mm printing on
Ilfospeed grade 2 and it was perfect for our set-up.

In another mail, you mentioned 8 minutes for HP5 Plus in 120.  To save
us reinventing the wheel, would you please be able to advise if this
time should be changed for 35mm and what would your recommendation be
for 35mm FP4 Plus ?  Both of these would be for printing on Ilfospeed
grade 2.

Much appreciate any advice.

Regards
Malcolm & Sylvia

I have the Contax 645 system. I  love the ergonomics.  The lenses are
amazing and everything works and is located where
you expect it.  I love shooting T400CN with this camera--you can blow up the
prints very, very large and get beautiful results.

Downside:  Pricy lenses and not many of them.  I would recommend getting the
grip as it allows you to use AA batteries (thats
what they are called here-not sure what you call them over there).

Downside of the Pentax is that you do not get removable backs (my
understanding--I have not used it).

  Hi all
  I'm a new subscriber, arrived by way of the Camera & Darkroom mag in the
UK.

  I'm thinking of buying either a Pentax or Contax 645 system. I'm aware of
the price and specification differences and amazed at the very low prices of
the Pentax lenses.  Has anyone had actual practical experience with either
camera that you may care to pass on?

  Additionally I'd appreciate any good articles/discussion forum links you
may know of. Thx

I have used the Pentax 645 since it came out. Excellent camera and =
superb lenses. The 35mm, 120 macro and 300edif are as good as any I have =
tried and the 300 edif is in a class by its self.=20
As an aerial photographer in my earlier career I've worn out 6 complete =
Hassy systems { 1600 shots a day will even wear out the lenses! } and =
would much rather have the 645 Pentax. While the new auto body is great =
their older non auto body may be the best choice due to price. For the =
last few years I've been shooting nothing but 8x10 for business { I sell =
large nature images 16x20 through 40+inches } but the 645 is always =
there waiting for the chance for moving subjects and quick and startling =
light situations . With care I can make 16x20 inch prints and even 20x24 =
where the grain just starts to show - the camera quality never is the =
factor - it's always a film/grain failure that is the limiting factor. =
This is a very underrated camera, and lenses especially at both ends of =
the lens length selection are excellent. =20

    I have the Contax 645 system. I  love the ergonomics.  The lenses =
are amazing and everything works and is located where
    you expect it.  I love shooting T400CN with this camera--you can =
blow up the prints very, very large and get beautiful results.
    =20
    Downside:  Pricy lenses and not many of them.  I would recommend =
getting the grip as it allows you to use AA batteries (thats
    what they are called here-not sure what you call them over there).
    =20
    Downside of the Pentax is that you do not get removable backs (my =
understanding--I have not used it).

        Hi all
        I'm a new subscriber, arrived by way of the Camera & Darkroom =
mag in the UK.
       =20
        I'm thinking of buying either a Pentax or Contax 645 system. I'm =
aware of the price and specification differences and amazed at the very =
low prices of the Pentax lenses.  Has anyone had actual practical =
experience with either camera that you may care to pass on?
        =20
        Additionally I'd appreciate any good articles/discussion forum =
links you may know of. Thx
       =20

I'm a brand new subscriber so apologize if this has been the subject of
recent discussion that I missed.

I'm searching for a way to use the Jobo 3000 series 8x10 tanks with
DiXactol. I just received the developer from Photographers Formulary  here
in the states and hope to use it in the Jobo tanks due to volume of work I
need to do. I can be loading one and drying another while one runs on the
machine. - this really helps my business. I'm brand new to DiXactol and
would appreciate any comments on rotary processing with it.  My main thought
and worry is that I'll loose the advertised compensating effects. I do plan
to use the single bath system for more zone system control.
Again sorry if this has been discussed before and would enjoy any previous
post being forwarded. Also is there anyway to access older post? { I'm also
a newby to group/lists such as Pure-Silver }
Thanks

Jeffrey,

As an international attorney (and one who loves his darkroom far more
than his courtroom), I thought I'd forward a simple guideline I've
learned which seems to adequately resolve questions of form or function
in the UK.  Simply reverse your instincts and you'll do fine.  Want to
drive?  Do it in the left lane.  Want to discuss large format?  It's not
4x5, it's 5x4.  Get it?  AA batteries?  No problem...

I couldn't resist.

In Outlook, one can turn off the preview pane so that you are just presented
with a list of messages. They need a double-click to open. A single-click
selects, and the Delete key does the rest.

Maybe this will work in Outlook Express too.

You can put a message in the delete box without opening it by having it
highlighted (single click) and then drag and dropping it into the delete
folder, then delete it.  I do that all the time.  You can tell if it works
because your "delete" folder will be bold print to show there is something
in there you haven't read.>

Reminds me of a review of a UK manufactured 5x4 film processor I once read 
in a US magazine (Shutterbug I think) written by a UK reviewer.  It said 
that it would work fine in the US if you turn the film through 90 degrees 
before loading ;-)

For occasional use, one crude way is to make a focus extension handle from 
wood.  Get a length, sized for the extension you need, of 1 x 2or3 and drill 
a hole in one end the size of your focusing knob.  Cut a slit from the other 
end to the hole so that squeezing that end tightens the wood on the knob.  
Then get the focus close by eye and finish the fine tune with the handle and 
grain focuser.  Works on my Elwood.

Hi Sylvia
Glad you like the results with DiXactol. You should use 8 minutes for HP5
Plus in 35mm, but you will probably find that grain becomes a little
obtrusive for bigger enlargements. FP4 is very nice in 35mm in the
developer - use 71/2 minutes. To be honest, the developer is so tolerant
because of its tanning and compensating action that you could use 71/2
minutes for Pan F, FP4, and HP5 and still get highly printable negatives.
Barry

Barry

We have been using PANF in your Di Xactol in single bath mode and the
results are really special.  Fine grain, beautiful tonality and razor
sharp edges.  We took your advice of 7 minutes for 35mm printing on
Ilfospeed grade 2 and it was perfect for our set-up.

In another mail, you mentioned 8 minutes for HP5 Plus in 120.  To save
us reinventing the wheel, would you please be able to advise if this
time should be changed for 35mm and what would your recommendation be
for 35mm FP4 Plus ?  Both of these would be for printing on Ilfospeed
grade 2.

Much appreciate any advice.

Regards
Malcolm & Sylvia

Dear C. Downs (wouldn't it be more friendly if I could use your first name?)
I am not familiar with the specific Jobo tanks you mention, but guess it is
one of  the familiar Jobo continuous rotary agitation type. You can use
these, but you will need to experiment with reduced times. You will
sacrifice some compensation as well as some stain and film speed - the stain
provides extra 'artificial' film speed. But more than anything, you will
sacrifice the adjacency effects that give the developer its ability to
provide almost etching-like sharpness. Going in the opposite direction to
continuous agitation, I have been conducting experiments with partial
'stand' development with DiXactol allowing up to 3 minutes between agitation
with some excellent streak free and extra-sharp extra-compensating effects.
However, with 10x8 the adjacency effects when printed would show far less
than with 35mm and medium format when printed, so that may not be too much
of a concern for you.
So I do not recommend continuous agitation with DiXactol for ultimate
results, but you will still find it  pretty good. As a start, you might try
a 20% reduction in time, and 1/2 stop drop in film speed from maker's
published speed. Note that this is not a reduction on Zone system tested
speeds. DiXactol, unlike conventional developers, does not normally need any
reduction from maker's speed. It produces about one third to one half stop
more speed than PMK usually.
So, say you were using HP5 Plus (which is a particularly good performer in
DiXactol), you might start by rating it at EI250 and developing for 7
minutes - that should put you in the ball park.

Subject:	DiXactol on jobo

I'm a brand new subscriber so apologize if this has been the subject of
recent discussion that I missed.

I'm searching for a way to use the Jobo 3000 series 8x10 tanks with
DiXactol. I just received the developer from Photographers Formulary  here
in the states and hope to use it in the Jobo tanks due to volume of work I
need to do. I can be loading one and drying another while one runs on the
machine. - this really helps my business. I'm brand new to DiXactol and
would appreciate any comments on rotary processing with it.  My main thought
and worry is that I'll loose the advertised compensating effects. I do plan
to use the single bath system for more zone system control.
Again sorry if this has been discussed before and would enjoy any previous
post being forwarded. Also is there anyway to access older post? { I'm also
a newby to group/lists such as Pure-Silver }
Thanks

At 5 foot 6 inches even when trying to stand up tall, and with extra short
arms that leave hands hidden in the sleeves of even short fitting jackets, I
sympathise with your problem! Other than the Paterson Major focus finder, or
the focusing knob flexible extension, you might try the dodge I successfully
use which I mentioned in 'Elements' - a circle of rubber got from cutting a
section from an auto tyre inner tube (a used one free from my local tyre
dealer) can be looped over the focusing knob and stretched downwards. It
grips the focusing knob which can be turned quite easily from a foot or more
away.
Now if I had simply kept quiet about the method of making these rubber
loops, bubble-packed them on a brightly coloured card, and labelled it
'Photographer's New Technology High Precision Remote Focusing Flexible
Manipulator', I could probably have been a millionaire by now!

fine I have never seen any, but I sorta' can find/see a sharper or less

I cannot focus and veiw at the same time... Does anyone know of a

Sure like the friendly thought so ,
  Hi Barry,
It's Chuck.
 I was afraid that I would be loosing some of the effects of the DiXactol. I
would say that usually the 10x8 is large enough to not worry about edge
effects but my passion { and business } is large nature prints of the
Southern Appalachians and is in need of as much detail as possible to convey
the  feeling of the scenes. I was interested in the   DiXactol for two
primary reasons first its' reputed accutance and the other { more important
in my case } reason is that my images often need a waterbath { D23 }
development to allow for the full detail in the shadows but somehow hold the
highlights. Ansel Adams has a wonderful example of just what I'm trying to
achieve titled "Early Morning, Merced River c.1950 } . This is very typical
of the lighting and subject that I usually work with. I have been working
with D23 and trying different procedures for water bath and just haven't had
any luck with the films I can easily purchase. { Tmax400 and HP5+ }
 I plan to try either film { preferably the tmax 400 } with DiXactol and
need the best procedure to achieve the highlight suppression that the old
water bath on thick emulsion was famous for. All of the things I have tried
so far loose the shadow detail or flatten the whole range so much that the
light ethereal look of the image disappears. I have been able to come close
by using PMK or RolloPyro and an unsharp mask weighted to the shadows only.
 I also often find myself in a rocky, craggy, gorge type areas in the fog
and need something to allow for the fog to have texture without loosing the
contrast needed for the rest of the images elements. I was sent a post you
wrote in March that says......

> . . I have a TMX picture in my next book of a backlit
> misty melting sky over a Scottish loch which would have been virtually
> unprintable with conventional development. There is a tiny fishing boat on
> the loch which is etching sharp too........

This sounds very similar.
 Please excuse the long post but I thought that describing exactly where I'm
headed would work best.
Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. I usually place the shadows a
little high in zone 3 to 4 to insure the detail needed but will try any
thing that would help. For years I've just avoided this type of light as too
contrasty but love the great dimensional quality it gives when handled
correctly.
Looking forward to trying any suggestions with DiXactol.
One more thing -- how is DiXactol pronounced - taking into consideration
that I'm from the southern part of the US and have a drawl     - My guess is
Di - axe - tol  ?  :o)
Thanks,
Chuck

Hi Richard,

Hubris is not a genetic component of the USA.  I have a friend (who should have
known better) who complained constantly about the fact that the "English drive on
the wrong side of the road," until I pointed out to him the automobile was an
English invention and that the deviance from custom was ours.  This very nearly
sent him to bed...

Regards,

bob

Richard, that KAK.Reg unable to load message is back. Is it good that it is
unable to load or is it a sign of some damage? I thought I had eliminated it
by going to symantec and MS but I don't get it. Thanks for any advice you
can offer.
Bill Lawlor

If memory servs, Sweden used to drive on the left side too and switched a
while
ago (wonder how that went).  I always wondered how they transfered cars
that were crossing over from Norway (driving on the proper right hand side).

I could just see the highway interchange looking like a DNA helix!

I recall that they planned that switchover for five years, but on the
Monday, there was massive gridlock.

1966.  I believe they banned all road traffic on a Sunday and changed all
the signs about on that one day, then everyone drove on the opposite side
of the road on Monday from that which they had used on Saturday.

I think Sweden currently has a population of about 5 million people
compared with the UK's 60 million.  No doubt Sweden was a lot less at
that time, so in such a large (for Europe) country it was probably not
such a big deal as it would be for the UK to change.  Doubt if there
were any highways with complex interchanges as we know them now either. 

Still, Japan, India and Australasia manage on the 'wrong side' too.

Oh well, I best get going to work - on the wrong side ;-)

I have several question on processing larger negatives:

    -  Does someone sell a washer that I can use for 8x10
      negatives?  I'd like to wash about 12 to 16 at a time.  I
      don't like tray washing and all the accompanying shuffling
      and handling.  I don't know about using a print washer since
      I don't like the idea of the negatives leaning up against a
      divider.  I haven't actually tried using a print washer.  If
      this actually works well then please let me know.

      The 4x5 washer's I've seen have groove that hold negatives by
      the edges but I haven't seen one for 8x10.

    - I also need recommendations or ideas on washing 7x17 negatives
      so any thoughts on that would be appreciated.

    - Does anyone know where I can find plastic trays about 12"x20"
      to process the 7x17 negatives and prints?  I've looked in a
      couple of stores specializing in containers for the home but
      haven't found something that's suitable.  I don't have enough
      room in my sink to use 16x20 or 20x24 trays so I have to look
      around for some that's long and skinny.


Any thoughts on these two problems would be appreciated.  Thanks

Hadi

I am fairly sure that Daimler (or Benz) are credited with creating the
first automobile in Germany.  Certainly all the car magazines gave
them credit in both the "100th Anniversary of the Automobile" and
"turn of the Century" issues.

I've heard of people using film hangars in print washers, to prevent them
from sticking to the dividers.

Hi Chuck
Good to hear what you are trying to achieve. I am very familiar with the
Ansel Adams print you mention.
But to start with, the correct pronunciation of the developer's name is
DyZaktol. Perhaps I should simply have called it that! I had evolved a
single bath acutance developer called Xactol, and went on to extend its
formula to accomplish two bath - hence DiXactol.
I know that water bath treatments are no longer effective. T-Max 400
responds particularly well to metol based two bath developers - see my web
site www.barrythornton.com for details of the formula. I was pleased to see
that Phil Davies in 'Beyond the Zone System' had also discovered that as a
good pairing with a slight hump in the characteristic curve to lift shadow
separation. TMY also works well with DiXactol, though its highlights are not
as harsh as TMX where DiXactol really shows its metal. My experience of
producing fine prints of mist scenes has been mostly from medium format, but
I have always found the most satisfying results came from HP5 Plus in single
bath DiXactol printed on graded paper. My favourite has been FortÅÈ Museum
lightly gold toned. I'm not sure that you can get that or that it is known
by that name in the States, but it is the extra heavy base paper warmtone
chlorobromide paper.
Hope that helps

Sure like the friendly thought so ,
  Hi Barry,
It's Chuck.
 I was afraid that I would be loosing some of the effects of the DiXactol. I
would say that usually the 10x8 is large enough to not worry about edge
effects but my passion { and business } is large nature prints of the
Southern Appalachians and is in need of as much detail as possible to convey
the  feeling of the scenes. I was interested in the   DiXactol for two
primary reasons first its' reputed accutance and the other { more important
in my case } reason is that my images often need a waterbath { D23 }
development to allow for the full detail in the shadows but somehow hold the
highlights. Ansel Adams has a wonderful example of just what I'm trying to
achieve titled "Early Morning, Merced River c.1950 } . This is very typical
of the lighting and subject that I usually work with. I have been working
with D23 and trying different procedures for water bath and just haven't had
any luck with the films I can easily purchase. { Tmax400 and HP5+ }
 I plan to try either film { preferably the tmax 400 } with DiXactol and
need the best procedure to achieve the highlight suppression that the old
water bath on thick emulsion was famous for. All of the things I have tried
so far loose the shadow detail or flatten the whole range so much that the
light ethereal look of the image disappears. I have been able to come close
by using PMK or RolloPyro and an unsharp mask weighted to the shadows only.
 I also often find myself in a rocky, craggy, gorge type areas in the fog
and need something to allow for the fog to have texture without loosing the
contrast needed for the rest of the images elements. I was sent a post you
wrote in March that says......

> . . I have a TMX picture in my next book of a backlit
> misty melting sky over a Scottish loch which would have been virtually
> unprintable with conventional development. There is a tiny fishing boat on
> the loch which is etching sharp too........

This sounds very similar.
 Please excuse the long post but I thought that describing exactly where I'm
headed would work best.
Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. I usually place the shadows a
little high in zone 3 to 4 to insure the detail needed but will try any
thing that would help. For years I've just avoided this type of light as too
contrasty but love the great dimensional quality it gives when handled
correctly.
Looking forward to trying any suggestions with DiXactol.
One more thing -- how is DiXactol pronounced - taking into consideration
that I'm from the southern part of the US and have a drawl     - My guess is
Di - axe - tol  ?  :o)
Thanks,
Chuck

It happened in 1967, I was 12 at the time (and I am Norwegian). The
standard joke is that they started with buses and lorries switching sides
first, and then gradually progressed to private cars. That is very nearly
true. At the stroke of midnight on the changeover date, all traffic was
stopped. Emergency vehicles switched first, then buses. Other traffic was
banned for a while, and groups of vehicles were allowed on the road in
stages. If I remember correctly, private cars were banned for 24 hours. A
lot of preparation was involved - from switching roadsigns and rebuilding
junctions to changing the doors on buses.

Ah yes, I remember that. There were big signs on both signs of the border,
and a crossover arrangement at the border point itself. Of course, there
were big signs on the Norwegian side of the border for years after telling
people _not_ to switch sides as they crossed the border.

At the risk of waking up tomorrow and finding that my credit is no longer
good at this establishment, let me send another honor to the UK.  That of
the pre-eminent automobile of our age, the Austin Mini Cooper 1275 S Type.
Having said that, I promise to stay firmly within topic.  Or go back to
lurking.

Here in the UK, garden centres are a good source of "odd" shaped trays. The
ones without drainage holes of course would serve your purpose.  Shallow
trays, which I have found ideal for toning, and the backs for applying pot
ferri - known here as butchers trays - are available from catering suppliers
in various sizes. Sorry I cannot translate for those who drive on the wrong
side!

I am sharing what I found out about the KAK virus I picked up on this list
from a "uvlight" message.

Information I have came from www.cai.com/press/2000/01/wscript_kak.htm

I highly recommend anybody having a kak message on startup refer to the
abovementioned site and run the MS patch linked thereto.

The KAK virus is a prank rather than a destructive virus, but, the next one
could be bad unless the vulnerability is closed. It arrives as a script file
in a signature on email. The script will run if the preview window on
Outlook Express is open! It is too late to delete the file because the
preview already opened it if you selected it. It runs in HTML. It appends
the virus as YOUR NEW SIGNATURE on outgoing mail you send!

I downloaded the MS Activex patch, set text to text instead of HTML or RTF,
and deleted the virus from the signature option. I have not tried editing
the reg. files yet. I hope the patch is enough.

I think I sent the virus out in the past few days without being aware of it.
Probably others on this silver list did too.

If your computer is a PC, running Netscape 4.0+ or IE5 you might have the
KAK worm. It will annoy you at 5:00 P.M. on the first of every month.

None of this happened with Win 3.1!

What I have done in the past is to use one of those 3 1/2 gallon hard rubber
tank.    Drill a few holes at the bottom of the tank (on the sides, not
directly in the bottom).  Put the negatives on hangers in the tank.  Then you
can just put the whole thing under the tap.   This should be a very efficient
film washing solution.  Because, the water with the hypo is heavier then the
pure water, it should go right down the drain.    Or you can get really fancy
and drill a hole down low, and put in a fitting and run plastic tubing to the
faucet.  then you can just let the water bubble over the top.

Highly unlikely,  there really isn't enough macs in the corporate world
using the internet to peek the interest of virus writers.  They are usually
looking were they can cause the most damage with the shortest amount of
time.
I'm sure there are some mac viruses somewhere, I have never heard of a
single one.

There have been only a handful of Mac compared to the 1000's of PC viruses,
but you may have another worry.
Depending on the internet connection you have you may be targeted for
hacking. The hackers are trying to find high speed computers { G3's and
G4's } to do their remailing of whatever they want sent out. The recent
attacks on web businesses have been through hacked macs. Regular 56k lines
are usually not wanted but if you go to a cable or ADSL line you would be
well served to use a "firewall" or similar program to stop hacking - I
installed one and have several "stops" a week but am on line most of the day
when working in the darkroom. { Business emails } This is not a big problem
now but is gaining strength fast. The BlackIce program I use is one of many
out there and most are self installing with only a few preferences you need
to set yourself. Very easy to work with. You might want to check out
different types of "firewall" programs as they vary in quality and I don't
know enough to be any help. I hope my use of the word "FIREWALL" is the same
terminology you use in the UK for these programs - if not maybe someone will
furnish the correct term for you wrong side drivers! :o)
Good Light ,
Chuck

While this thread is certainly outside the "central charter" of the mailing 
list, its raison d'etre is due (even if  indirectly) to the list's existence. 
 With all the complexity & vagaries of viruses the & systems they infest, I 
feel making any related information available to the entire group is 
appropriate.  Certainly, without certain postings, I would not have been 
aware of the resources to consult to determine the extent of the damage to my 
computer.  Thanx.

Not really - viral infection occurs at the source not from the list.  It is
the obligation of anyone sending email to run the necessary anti-viral
software to minimize exposure to such problems.  The list merely echos
whatever is sent to it as-is.  It would be extremely inefficient, not
to mention very labor intensive for me to add viral checking to 
list contributions.

This is why I had no objection to the thread running for a while.  However,
at this point, I think it has been well discussed and further commentary
and tutorials on virus prevention really belongs off-list.

Is there any possibility to have gotten this KAK virus with Macintosh. I am
not an expert in computer and I would be interested to know. Many thanks.

   More details needed.
What are the symptoms?
Are these "rapid" fixers, if so what dilution are you using?
Do you use single or two bath fixing?
How fresh is the fixing bath?
  What is the temperature of the bath?
Type of film(s) used.

   I use SS Nikor tanks for 35mm, roll film, and 4x5 sheet film. I have 
never enountered fixing problems with any of them. Posting more details as 
above, will help to diagnose what is going on.

Hey
	Just wondering if anyone has ever had a problem with 
unusually long fixing times using steel reels. I've tried Kodak and 
Ilford fixers, and even used distilled water but I still have to fix 
for at least 14 minutes and even then it is not complete. Any 
thoughts?

This is not a problem and is not due to inadquate fixing.  The dyes are either
for sensitization or anti-halation.   The "high-tech" Delta and T-Max films use
more sensitizing dyes than most films.   Leaving the magenta hue will cause no
problem.   Some people find that they can remove it with wash aid, aka hypo
clearing agent.

My observation is that the determining factor for the density of the dye is the
development step.   Most of the dye washes out in the developer and short
development will leave more dye behind.

Have you changed ANYTHING in your procedures?   Particularly, the developer or
developer time.

The primary message is that you don't need to worry about this.

An advertising piece received recently from a vendor of archival storage 
supplies claims that glassine envelopes are not "archival safe" for 
negatives.  This could be disturbing to me, as I have over 15,000 frames of 
35 mm stored in glassine (from two makers of "photo" supplies).

Any comments or reports of your experience?

I've only recently started playing with B&W again, using Ilford HP4+.  I've
not yet been able to completely eliminate a pinkish hue from the film.
Additional fixing and wash-aiding helped but did not eliminate it. If I
look at one sheet I cant really see it, but hold two or more together and
its very obvious.
They (Ilford) told me the film base should have that color, but since other
people dont report it I am skeptical.

I'm still on my first batch, so i cant say if its a batch problem or not

Are you looking to get rid of the color  in your film, or fix the silver
image?  5 minutes is plenty with a rapid fixer be that Kodak, Ilford,
Formulary, Sprint....

The symptoms are there is still a noticeable magenta hue to the film 
after 14 minutes of fixing. The fixers used were Kodafix and Iflord 
Universal both at 1:3  dilution. I get this problem even with 
perfectly fresh working solutions. I tried using distilled water as I 
don't live in the best area for tap water. The temperature of the 
bath is 68* , the same as the Dev. and stop. The film is Delta 400 
from Ilford. I've only used a one bath method as this has been 
sufficient in the past. I use a Kindermann tank and reels
I've used this film for the better part of 5 years and never had this 
problem before. I'm beginning to think I got a bum batch.

Tim,

Use Kodak Rapid Fix .  The standard plain jane fixer, like Kodafix doesn't
do the trick with the Delta or TMax films.  The use of a wash aid (Hypo
Clear, Orbit or similar) helps get the stain out also.  The magenta stain
really doesn't hurt anything. It simple will add some density to the
negative.

   Glassine can cause problems with the emulsion sticking to it after long 
storage.

   Both T-Max and Delta films have sensitizing dyes which tend to persist 
through processing. For T-Max a normal bath in a sulfite wash aid will get 
rid of it. I am not sure of Delta films, the dye there seems to be more 
persistent.
   Both of these films have more than the usual amount of silver iodide in 
them. The iodide radical leaches out in the fixing bath tending to slow it 
down. Ammonium thiocyanate fixer (rapid fixer) is more resistant to this 
than sodium thiosulfate fixer. The fixing times for rapid fixer should not 
be over five minutes but it will still leave the residual dye. Standard 
fixers should be allowed to work for at least ten minutes.
  I strongly recommend a two bath fixing arrangement for these films, most 
of the iodide will come out in the first bath insuring complete fixing.
   Some other films will have slight resicual color, probably from 
anti-halation dye which has not decolorized in the developer. It generally 
fades out with exposure to light.
    35mm film has an anti-light-piping dye or pigment in the support 
itself. This is not removed or decolorized by processing. Generally it is 
neutral gray.
   Check the activity of the fixing bath by fixing a scrap of film in the 
light and measuring the clearing time. Soak the film in water for a few 
minutes before making the test.  Clearing time is when there is no longer 
any visible cloudiness in the film. Fixing time is generally twice this 
time. Check freshly mixed fixer this way and discard it when the clearing 
time becomes substantially longer than when fresh. The old books say twice 
the clearing time but that is probably much too long. Perhaps 25% time 
increase it more like it when a single bath is used. The capacity of a 
single bath fixer to complete the complex fixing process is very limited.

yeah, go through and move your best negatives out of the glassine and 
into poly pages right away- then start moving the rest of your negs out 
of the glassine.

Hi,

I used to work for a Provincial Archives photo lab as the technician, and
recieved extensive training on archival handling and storage practices.
Glassine is absolutely to be avoid for long term storage of negative and
prints. Even those sold as "acid-free" have stability issues, and should be
discarded for storage.

This is all almost certainly true, but I have many negatives dating back to
the 60s that are stored in glassine envelopes, and while the glassine
itself has turned yellow and brittle looking, the negatives inside are
pristine.  

However, as they say on those TV auto commercials, don't try this at home.

Same for me.  Late 50's, early 60's.  Two hundred fifty rolls of 120, all in 
those Agfa wallet-accordion things.  Look okay now, but I'll be keeping an 
eye on them.

  What you're seeing most likely isn't insufficient fixing but leftover
sensitizing dyes. You can safely ignore the dyes, or...

  Fix 3-5 mins/75-65F with _continuous agitation_, then give the negs a
couple minutes treatment in a hypo-clear agent, then 20-30 mins wash. You
can use store-bought hypo-clear such as Orbit Bath, or easily make it by
dissolving about a tablespoon of sodium sulfite in a quart of water.

You can also just let the film soak with several dumps and refill wit water.
The wash volume may not be as critical as just the time of the water soak.
This has been my experience with both Delta and TMax films.

Tim - I have the same problem and I don't know of any way to delete without
also opening. Also, in your original mesage you asked about saving
attachments to a disc. If you get the same message I get from Outlook
Express with attachments, the message is confusing. When it asks whether you
want to save the attachment to a disc,  it doesn't mean to a zip disc or
other similar disc, it means to your hard drive. In other words, it's asking
whether you wish to save the attachment to your hard drive. That's where it
will go if you click on "yes" (at least if we're refering to the same
message). Brian

Brian, I set outlook express to turn off the preview panel option. When I
click ONCE the email file is hilighted but not opened. I can delete it then.

Today I got a FW file of unknown origin. Suspecting a virus, I did as above,
then followed it into the recycle folder and deleted it again.

Good Luck, Bill Lawlor

The attached program is intended for anyone running MS Internet Explorer

1) Save the attachment on your hard disk somewhere.
2) Execute the program - it will install itself.

        Some email viruses spreading WITHOUT opening attachment

Systems running Internet Explorer (IE) version 5.0 and/or MS Office 2000 are
vulnerable to some virus attacks using most email systems, even if the email
recipient opens no attachments.
You don't even have to use IE; just have it installed with the default
security settings.  If you have not closed the hole, you can receive viruses
(and spread them) by viewing or previewing malicious email without opening
any attachment, or by visiting a malicious web site. The problem is caused
by a programming bug in an Internet Explorer ActiveX control called
scriptlet.typelib.
This is by far the fastest growing virus distribution problem and ripe for a
hugely destructive event - at least as large as the ILOVEYOU virus.
Updating your virus detection software, while important, is not an effective
solution for this problem.  You must also close the hole.  The hole can be
closed by running the following fix:

certainly anyone with any caution would suspect that Tim's address
book was hijacked by a virus, and that running the attachment
would be the WORST thing to do.  

If there is a patch, it should be posted on a legitimate place, 
e.g. microsoft's web site.  It should NOT be distributed in
a zillion copies attached to mail.

Tim: where did you get this?

   The patch is available from the Microsoft web site. It would be best to 
post a
link to that site rather than an attachment.
   There is a link to both updates and information from Microsoft's home 
page at http://www.microsoft.com  An article about security problems with 
Outlook, etc., is 
at:  http://officeupdate.microsoft.com/2000/articles/out2ksecarticle.htm

  The potential security problems from Active-X have been well known for a 
long time. Only Microsoft seems to have ignored them.

OK, here's the M$ KnowledgeBase article on what Tim sent out:

http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q240/3/08.ASP

There are at least 2 other links in this knowledge base article.  This
fix addresses the kak worm (which has been spotted here on this list),
bubbleboy and similar ilk.

and here's where to get the executable directly from MS (the link
may wrap in your mail reader and you may have to copy and paste
it into your browser address bar or use 'ftp' to get it (:^o   )
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/peropsys/IE/IE-Public/Fixes/usa/eyedog-fix/x86/q
240308.exe

As of 17:26 (Central Time) the file at the FTP site and the one Tim
attached
are byte for byte identical.

Hi folks

Does anyone out there manage to get their fibre-base prints to dry flat?  If
so, what method do you use?
I've tried:
-    Hanging from a line (the prints, not me) with clothes pegs, back to
back
-    Squeegeeing onto glass, face down
-    Laying horizontally on a rack
-    Placing in a Paterson drying rack (designed for RC prints)
-    Using a Kayser electric drier-glazer, both with and without the glazing
plate.
None of these is particularly satisfactory.
I'm persuaded by the argument that the air flow is greater around the edges
of the print and, as the edges dry first, edge curling occurs.  If this is
the reason, I have not made the intellectual leap to the solution.
Your thoughts, please.

Regards
Peter Young

'silver folk -

I have been (and continue to be) unwilling to sell the mailing list or otherwise
provide commerical vendors with information which would allow them to directly
attempt to sell you stuff via unsolicited email.

However, I have also been carrying the financial burden of the network costs 
and hardware to keep this list running entirely myself.

As you all know, any pure-silver mailing has a short tag line appended to the
end (see below) telling you the email came from this list and URL for the
relevant web site.

Here's the question:  What would you all think if I were to seek some
commercial "sponsorship" which would appear as a brief advertisement in
the trailing tag line of each email?  Let me be clear, I will not do this
if I hear that doing so will cause people to leave the list en masse - 
this list depends on you all to maintain the community we have formed and
I will not compromise this.

Another option is to run the list as "shareware" in which list participants
would be asked to contribute a nominal sum ($30 US / year ?) to defray
the operational costs of pure-silver.  I personally do not favor this
because I want the list to be freely available to anyone interested and
I do not want to prevent those unable to contribute such funds (such
as students) from joining.  Besides, this approach is an administrative
nightmare -  I would much rather deal with one funding entity if I am
going to do this at all.

For the record, the costs to do this are small - the real cost is time,
and there is nothing I can do about that.  My real goal is create enough
funding to do the massive hardware upgrade that the pure-silver server
desparately needs.

Options/objections/alternatives????

Hi Tim,

As a long time lurker and occassional poster, I saw go ahead get the
sponsorships.  Many people do not understand the costs involved in running a
list such as this.  If it will help you and insure the continued success of
thepure-silver mailing list, I'm all for it.

Hi Tim,

The sponsorship sounds quite acceptable.  I've often wondered how this
list is financed.  It's my favorite lurker hideout and the value is
significant to me.  I agree that the shareware approach may be a hurdle
to some.  Perhaps a short, annual voluntary contribution drive a la
National Public Radio would speed the acquisition and hardware update
process a little.

Regards,

bob

Get a sponser instead of charging a membership fee.
How about  Camera Arts/View Camera or LensWork Magazines as sponsors?
The Formulary or Calumet  also come to mind as "appropriate".

Dear Tim
Since Ed and you advertised this list on Camera & Darkroom, I do love
it.
So whatever way you will chose I will follow. I prefer you get some ad.
If you're lucky enough these ads will cover a little more than the
hardware 
needed.
This will help pay for your time, or give you some help buying
photographic stuff... ;-)
Please go !

Dear Tim
Since Ed and you advertised this list on Camera & Darkroom, I do love
it.
So whatever way you will chose I will follow. I prefer you get some ad.
If you're lucky enough these ads will cover a little more than the
hardware 
needed.
This will help pay for your time, or give you some help buying
photographic stuff... ;-)
Please go !

Sponsorship sounds fine to me (a lurker).  Goods and services related to the
list would actually be nice to see.

	I just now offered the list owner to host the list here at
kjsl.com, home of many other mailing lists (some related to
photography even). Never a fee or a banner :)

Tim,

Time for me to stop lurking and speak up! I think the sponsorship idea is a 
good one, but I would also be willing to pay $30 per year for Pure Silver. 
Whatever works best for you.

I agree with all the good comments on this subject. It is a win-win idea 
with benefits to the forum and the sponsor.

I appreciate all you hard work.

It's your site, but I have problems with "eye candy" graphics (but maybe 
that's isn't easily done in email ;-)

Otherwise, no problem, and there's even a chance I'd learn something.

Thanks for asking Tim. I don't have any objection to your sponsorship =
proposal. It would be slightly more difficult to pay a fee from here, =
unless you were to accept sterling cheques or credit card payments. In =
anycase I think that this route may limit the overseas appeal?  So if =
you can find advertisers to pay your bills go for that.

Either way thanks for the service, it makes a relaxing change to read =
the list after a hard day at the office eating dogs!

Regards Dave Miller

Same goes for me, too.  Have you considered approaching "PHOTOTechniques" 
magazine?  I perceive them as a benign, well-meaning bunch.  Thanks for all 
your time & effort to keep this list going.

'silver folk -

I have been (and continue to be) unwilling to sell the mailing list or
otherwise
provide commerical vendors with information which would allow them to
directly
attempt to sell you stuff via unsolicited email.

However, I have also been carrying the financial burden of the network costs
and hardware to keep this list running entirely myself.

Not to change the subject or anything, but it seems to be unanimous and I
shudder to think how many people might not have weighed in yet. 

Once upon a time I saw a web page with a table that showed every
conceivable type of film and their available sizes, speeds, and other good
stuff like color bias for color film (can I say color here?). I cant find
it now, anyone know what I'm talking about?

Tim,

Sponsorship sounds like a great idea to me.  I'd also pay 30 bucks (pounds,
lier, marks, rubbles, or dollars), but please don't sell the addy.  I get
plenty of junk mail already.

P-S,
Need your experiences, some time back I picked up an Omega C67.  The one
down side is trying to find another 6x7 condenser for doing 6x6 work.  My
neighbor is in the process of selling her color darkroom.  I don't know
anything about the Vivitar VI.  Just beginning to play with it before I
purchase it.  I didn't realize it had head movements, could be beneficial
and I do not have any desire to do color.  If I decide to purchase it, I
can't keep both.

So your suggestions will be appreciated.

Thanks
John

  It's a decent little enlarger but accessories, parts and repairs pretty
much don't exist. Go ahead only if it has everything you might possibly
need and it's sufficiently cheap.

John, I have owned and used both the Omega 67 and a Vivitar. I threw the
whole Vivitar away because I could not get any neg carriers for it. I see
why I got it for free. The Omega C67 I had was the model with the a dichroic
color difusion head. I did a lot of color and b&w printing with it. It is a
very good mechanical and optical design, IMO.I traded up to a 4X5 because I
wanted to do 6X9. It would be worthwhile contacting Omega for a new
condensor or one of the several guys who sell parts on the web. Glenn Evans
and Terry Seaman come to mind. Also, try rec.photo lists.

You can do multicontrast b&w printing with the color Vivitar but I would not
pay much for that enlarger because there are no parts available. There seem
to be a lot of used enlargers on the market now because people are going
digital.

Good luck, Bill Lawlor

Thank you for the replies, I'm just beginning to get my darkroom together.
I figured as much about the vivitar but it is complete.  Everything made out
of plastic compared to the C67.  The C67 came with just the supplementary
(35) condenser, no 6x7 condensers.  Terry Seaman was a big help, he had one
brand new 6x7 condenser,  still looking for another for my 6x6 negs.  I just
posted a question with omega.  BTW who in Glenn Evans or how do I get in
touch with him.

Here is a list of what she is offering.

Her equipment includes
Vivitar VI dichroic head
Color by beselar include electric roller, 3 different tube sizes up to
11x14.
Print dryer, looks like a hot plate with cloth.
Four lenses,
    El-nikkor 50/2.8
    El-omegar by rodenstock  50/3.5
    El-omegar 50/3.5
    Vivitar 35/3.5 wide angle
Omega SCA-100 Color Analyzer
Vivitar Digital Timer
misc. developing reels and tubes
safelight
etc, etc.

Anyway she is asking 150.

John

John, you don't need a different condenser for 6X6. The 6X7 is appropriate.
What you do need are 6X6 carrier and a good 75 or 80 mm lens. Minimum would
be an EL Nikkor 80mm/5.6 six element lens for superb results. All that other
stuff she is offering is of no use to you. Buy the lens and get a set of VC
filters.

Dear John;
        For that price I would seriously consider it,  The El-Nikkor 50 F 2.8 is
$129 at B&H. The other lenses you should be able to get at least 10 -15 each for
them on Ebay.  The nice thing about a color head is that it can be used for
printing on multi-grade paper or used when copying slides for color correction.
If you are a tinkerer, then you could probably adapt  the color head to your
Omega.  The color analyzer is also something that should easily sell on Ebay.
Also if the developing tubes and reels are the same system that you use, they
would be good to have.  The thing about buying used darkroom equipment is this,
Darkroom stuff hardly ever wears out and if you buy out someone's darkroom, you
get a lot of great little stuff thrown in that would you are arm some real money
to buy new.  I have always gotten new stuff for my darkroom this way.  Then sell
off the stuff that you do not need.  I am sure that you will do better than
break even.

        About the condenser for  6x6, the only real advantage in having that
condenser  your exposure times will be a little shorter.  But other than that
there is no real advantage.  I do everything up to 4x5 with one condenser in my
enlarger.

HTH

  It's probably worth that for all that stuff, providing there are
sufficient lensboards and neg carriers. If there's not a 6x6 carrier then
don't even bother.

  I got the impression the only condensers present was the set for 35mm
only. Perhaps I read wrong.

The vivitar has a 35mm and 6x6 neg. carrier.  Extra bulbs.

Perhaps I don't know enough about enlargers or just confusing everyone.
I picked up the omega C67 cheap.  It had only one condenser in the housing,
a small one, I figured for 35mm work, because the enlarger came with a 35mm
neg carrier.  I was under the impression that I needed a 6x7 condenser
sitting at the bottom of housing, close to the lens, with the smaller
condenser sitting on top of it.  Then in order for me to do 6x6 work that I
had to replace the 35mm condenser with a 6x7 condenser to do my 6x6 work.
So you would have a 6x7 on top of 6x7.

Please set me straight.
Confused in Katy,
John

If it's anything like the ancient Omega D2 I'm using, you don't stack the 
condensers.  They are replaced depending on the format you're printing.  I 
have a condenser for 35mm, and one for 4x5. When printing 35mm.. use the 
proper condenser.  When going to the larger formats (I use the 4x5 condenser 
for 120 and up), take the 35mm condenser out and put the 4x5 condenser in.

And of course use the appropriate lens for the format.  :-)

    I also picked up an Omega C-67 cheap some 15 yrs ago, and have 
been using it off and on since with good results.  On the inside of 
the cover to the condenser housing is a diagram of how the various 
elements should be arranged:  On the bottom, just above the neg. 
carrier is a large convex condenser("6x7" flat side down).  On top is 
either a large (6x7) or a smaller (35 mm) condenser with flat side 
up.  On top of that is the heat-absorbing glass and the filter 
carrier.  My setup (quite used at the time) came with all 3 condenser 
elements.
    I don't know where you would find a new element, but as I only do 
35 mm work for now (and dream of 4x5), I might see my way clear to 
parting with my "extra."
    Also: I recently had the bulb burn out on me.  After ~3 days of 
hunting for a bulb with the bizzare  omega part no., it turns out it 
is a very common bulb under several other numbers.

Hi All

We have been lumbered with a dreaded wedding photo shoot and have to now
print the results with sepia tone.  We are planning on printing on
Ilford RC multigrade pearl paper and toning with Agfa 'Brown Toner' - as
recommended by our local photo supplier.

The question is, does anyone have any opinion on the likely success of
toning all the prints in one batch after the prints have dried ?

This is one job we need to speed up and get out of the way ASAP !

Regards
Malcolm & Sylvia

Agfa Brown toner-could they mean Viradon?

    If so, you will need to tone individually rather than putting a batch in
the toner to avoid surface abrasions.

Hi Dan

You are right.  Underneath the extra US health warning label which has
been stuck on top of the original Agfa package, the word 'Viradon' can
just about be read.  Good point of yours about surface abrasions but how
about if we do the prints individually after they have dried from the
original print process ?  It's just that we want to get some kind of a
batch process going here.

Much appreciate your input.

Regards
Malcolm & Sylvia

I am new to the list, but sponsorship sounds like a
good idea.  I'd also be willing to make a small
contribution to help with aquisition costs of hardware
and any software.  It may be helpful to check with
Gordon Holtstadter of the Alt-Photo-Process list to
see how he manages the listserver.

Ya know...have you guys ever heard of a site called egroups.com ?? they 
recently bought onelist.com and offer free list hosting where anybody 
can start and manage email lists...And it's free because they run their 
own ads at the bottom of the posts. No need for hardware purchases...

Why wait for the prints to dry? If they are dry, then you need to 
presoak before toning. Wash completly before toning... incomplete 
washing will make for uneven toning. Are you going to re-fix and wash 
after toning?

	I already offered free hosting here, without any kind of ads,

Hi Sylvia. & group,
I've just picked on my mail after travelling and saw your post re. DiXactol.
FWIW, I have recently been using DiXactol with FP4 after discussion with
Barry and as a 1 shot dev I found it highly impressive (I got a little
streaking with 2 bath). I'm looking forward to making final prints from
these negs yet as I have been away, but the prelim. selective enlargement
tests I did look great
Tim

Sylvia,

    A few things you need to be aware of. Be very sure your rinse is
complete before toning or you will have problems. Then, you can batch and
tone easily, just do them one at a time as the surface becomes quite
delicate while in the Viradon. If you aren't going to use a sulfite bath
after toning, make sure you rinse the final time with purified or distilled
water if your water supply is at all hard water. If it is you may find a
white & milky/chalky residue on the surface of all your prints. The water
quality matters here. I recently had to re-do 125 16x20 prints in purified
water for about 15 minutes each due to the problem. But, the purified water
did get rid of the problem-forewarned is a good way to avoid the problem.

Why use a 'smelly' sepia toner? It is unpleasant and tends to fog unsed
emulsions. A variable thiocarbamide sepia type gives you the advantage of
being able to choose from a range of sepia colours and also to control the
effect at the bleaching stage. They work well with MG1V RC although giving a
cooler effect than on MGWT, and can be tastefully subtle.
It may be that the extra stage invloved and the risk of variabilty via the
bleach (if partial) are things you don't want if you want to push through as
fast as possible though.

You can buy 'variable' sepia toners from a variety of manufactures -
Fotospeed is a good one, but there are several, and most are based on
Thiocarbamide. They are very easy (and cheaper) to make up from scratch
though and formulae are widely published e.g. in the Darkroom Cookbook, or
for that matter in my first book where you can also find examples of some of
the colours obtainable.
They employ a separate bleach as a first step, followed by a 'redevelopment'
in a toning bath - easy.
The results can be varied both by the amount of bleaching allowed in the
bleach (- this controls how far into the tonal range the sepia will reach,
e.g. whether it is just the highlights, or down into the midtones, or
whether all tones including  the blacks are converted to sepia.) and by the
amount of 'additive' (sodium hydroxide) that you mix into the toning bath
 - this will vary the colour of the brown anywhere from a yellow brown,
through mid brown/sepia to a chestnut deep purple brown) The colours also
vary with the paper in use and how it is developed.

Try Fotospeed ST20 Vario Toner if you can find it.  It is made in England and
distributed in the US by Luminos.  There is no odor, and you can control the
color change.
Photographer's Formulary also has a similar toner, although I have not tried it
yet.

Been down this road many time recently.  The ONLY way I can find out to get 
FLAT fibre-base prints is with a Dry Mount Press.

This is what list members told me and what Ilford told me.  Nothing short of 
a Dry Mount Press will begin to flatten the edges, while the methods you've 
tried (and me too) will flatten the center, the edges will forever curl.

Peter,

I've tried everything as well, and finally gave in to using a Seal Dry Mount 
Press.

I dry my prints face up on fiberglass screens for 24 hours then two minutes 
at about 180 degrees in the press. I know they're expensive, but I would have 
to say it's become a virtual necessity for me. I cut two pieces of mat board 
as a sandwich, so the print never actually touches the press.

My only regret is I should have made the investment many years ago.

Hello,

> several places in Europe and US. Forte is sold in US  as Luminos.

I don't know about the Forte/Bergger similarities, but Forte and Luminos 
are 2 different papers. To begin with, Luminos is made in England. Their 
base is also different. Their speed is different. They do not have the same 
reaction to selenium toning. We do have Luminos and Forte in the US of A., 
and that's the only two brands of papers I use for years.
By the way, Bergger is still of a curiosity over here. Their film is not 
readily available. The last time I ordered Bergger in 4x5 from Bostick and 
Sullivan, I got the 3 last boxes, and was told that they didn't know when 
it will be available again, as Bergger was working with a new importer,if I 
remember correctly. Was 3 or 4 months ago.
Best.

Before I caved to buying the Seal Dry Mount, I had some success with the
following.

After drying, face down on screen, re-dampen (Spritz the back lightly). Then
place between two pieces of plate glass (1/8 - 3/16" thick) with interleaved
archival paper.

Peter,

>Does anyone out there manage to get their fibre-base prints to dry flat?  If
>so, what method do you use?

It has been years since I had more than the occasional wavy edges... IMHO
the wavy-edge syndrome is a result of trying to, or inadvertantly drying
prints too fast.

I would not generally recommend anything other than DW papers unless you
can drum dry... or ferrotype on either on squeeky-clean plate plate glass
or chrome plates.

If your area is very low in humidity.. like around here at times, we get
down below 15%.... I have, and still use, blotters... after the DW FB print
has been gently squeegeed back and front, place between thick (flat)
blotters... replace the now damp blotters with clean (and dry) ones after
about 15 minutes.... change blotters after about 30 minutes and again after
about an hour... leave the prints in the last set of blotters (with a
little top weight) overnight.  I have had prints dry "almost flat" in under
two hours by changing blotters as frequently as required

Alternatively, after the gentle squeegee, gently lay the prints emulsion
side down onto nylon screens for overnight drying.

In both cases you may need to (gently) iron the back of the pring with a
hot iron or leave in a DM press for a few minutes at temperature... I would
recommend the prints be sandwiched between blotters for both final
flattening procedures.

Eric,

Can you explain why face down, especially on larger prints? Do you get less 
curl or are you concerned with water spots or some other reason. My concern 
has been the emulsion picking up dust or chemistry in the screens, so I've 
always dried face up. I use PhotoFlo and squeegee well, so I don't have 
problems with water spots.

BTW, I've found that the PhotoFlo (spelling?) allows the rubber squeegee to 
move across the image with almost no friction. Without the PhotoFlo I feel 
like I might damage the emulsion. As far as I know, highly diluted PhotoFlo 
leaves no stains or dangerous chemistry on the paper.

As far as the 600.00 dollars (US) or so required to buy a dry mount press, 
has anyone found an alternate product? Seems like a restaurant supply house 
would have some kind of flat grill type device which can be set a specific 
temperature. Since you have to enclose your print in mat paper anyway, a flat 
surface is all you need. Add some heavy books and you have one half of a dry 
mount press for under 100.00.

Or is the selenium toner finally getting to me?

Thanks!

I got my press in a yard sale for 75 cents!!!  It was one of my best deals!!  
Before that I placed my prints between sheets of release paper then betwen 
flat sheets of mat board and ironed them with a cloths iron.  It works ok 
just take your time and apply even pressure for a few minutes.

I wonder if placing the print in the oven for 10 minutes then quickly 
applying heavy books might do the trick??? Just a thought...worth a try on a 
ruined print.

   This is in response to the recent thread on sepia toning.

   First advice, get Tim Rudman's book _The Photographer's Master Pinting 
Course_, it is a must-have book.

   The purpose of the toner is to change the metallic silver of the image 
to either Silver sulfide or Silver Selenide, or a combination.
   There are broadly two catagories of sepia toners, direct and indirect.
Direct toners are a single bath, in which the print is treated to tone it. 
Examples of direct toners are Kodak Brown Toner, Agfa Viradon, Kodak Poly 
Toner, Kodak Rapid Selenium Toner, Nelson's Gold Toner, and the classic 
Hypo-Alum toner.

   Indirect toners require the silver image to be bleached in a bath which 
converts the metallic silver of the image into a silver halide, usually 
silver bromide. The re-halogenated image is then treated in a bath of a 
sulfiding agent to convet the halogen to silver sulfide, or a seleniding 
agent to produce silver selenide.  Indirect selenium toners are not 
available on the market.

    The two chemicals used to redevelop the halogenated silver to silver 
sulfide are Sodium Sulfide, or Thiocarbamide. Thiocarbamide has the 
advantage of not evolving hydrogen sulfide gas (rotten egg odor) so does 
not have the odor problem of the sulfide. Hydrogen Sulfide is also a 
prodigious fogging agent, so a sodium sulfide redeveloping bath should be 
used well away from undeveloped film or paper. This goes for direct toners 
like Kodak Brown toner or Viradon, and otehrs, which emit a lot of hydrogen 
sulfide. If you can smell it keep it away from sensitive material.

    Kodak Poly Toner and Agfa Viradon are combinations of a direct 
sulfiding toner and a direct Selenium toner.
    All toners are affected by the structure of the original image. In 
general (meaning there are exceptions), warm-toned iamges will tone more 
and tone more toward a yellow color than colder toned images. The original 
image tone reflects the crystaline strucure of the silver image. Generally, 
the finer grained the image the warmer toned, or more yellow, its color 
will be. The final color will be affected by both the nature of the 
emulsion and the developer.

   Again in general, direct toners will produce a cooler (bluer) color than 
indirect toners given the same image characteristic.

   For indirect toners the structure of the bleached image is affected by 
the nature of the bleaching bath as well as the original silver image. By 
varying the bleach the final image tone can be changed over some range. 
While the best known variable color toner is a thiocarbamide toner it is 
also possible to vary the color of an image redeveloped in sulfide to some 
extent by varying the bleach.

   The color which can be obtained from any particular material must be 
discovered by experimentation. However, direct toners, especially direct 
Selenium, will cause little or no image color change with blue black or 
cold neutral papers. They do actually tone the image, often intensifying 
them, but there may not be a significant color change.
    For cold or nutral papers an indirect toner wil often produce a good 
cold brown or sepia tone, they may be too yellow for warm toned papers.
   For warm toned papers a direct toner will produce a variety of brown, 
purple, or redish sepia tones. They may be ineffective with cold toned paper.

   Any image _fully_ toned in either sulfide or selenium is very permanent. 
Prints toned so that there is still some untoned silver may be less 
permanent. Very little sulfiding is needed to protect the image, little 
enough so that a definite image color change may not be produced.
   Selenium, unfortunately split tones, i.e., it tones the finer grained 
particals of the denser parts of the image before it tones the highlights. 
When the often recommended procedure of toning with highly diluted Kodak 
Rapid Selenium Toner is used the highlights may not be toned enough to 
protect them from oxidizing.

   When an inderect toner is used the prints must be very well washed 
before toning. The bleach is ferricyanide, if there is any residual 
thiosulfate in the emulsion it will combine with the residual thiosulfate 
to form Farmer's reducer, diminishing the overall density of the print. 
Other toners vary in the need to wash before toning. Prints to be toned in 
the old Hypo-Alum toner do not need to be washed at all since the toner 
itself is sulfided hypo.

   Some toners must be used at elevated temperatures, Hypo-Alum and Kodak 
Brown Toner are examples. Paper to be toned in these toners should be fixed 
in a _hardening_ fixing bath to avoid emulsion damage

   The best known variable sepia toner is one published by DuPont-Defender 
many years ago. It is the one in _The Darkroom Cookbook_. It was originally 
intended to be used with Defender Velour Black  and Defender Varigam 
papers.  If the list is interested I can post the original recipes. This 
toner uses Thiocarbamide as the redeveloper.

   There are many published formulas for toners. Here are some examples to 
illustrate the many variations.
   Indirect toners include Kodak T-7a, Ansco/Agfa 221, and Defender 4-T are 
exemples.  The Kodak bleach includes Potsssium Oxalate, the Ansco bleach 
does not. The Defender bleach contains "strong ammonia water".  Also in 
this catagory is the Defender Varigam varyable toner which has three 
variations of the bleach and three variations of the redeveloper plus a 
gold modifier.

   Direct toners include Hypo-Alum toners like Kodak T-1a and Ansco/Agfa 
222 as examples. The Agfa toner contains Iodide, Kodak does not. Also in 
this catagory are Polysulfide toners like Kodak T-8, which is similar to 
Kodak Brown Toner. All of these are used at elevated temperatures.

   Gold-blue toner can be used to modify the tone of a sepia toned print. 
When used directly on a silver image it results in a soft blue color. When 
used on a sulfided print the Gold toner results in a red tone. It can be 
used on partially sulfided prints to produce split tones (see Rudman's book 
for more and for examples).

   Prints to be toned in Selenium or in combination toners like Poly Toner 
and Viradon must be neutral or somewhat alkaline. Otherwise there is a 
chance of a deposit of elemental Selenium on the print resulting in a 
brownish yellow overall stain.
   Prints should be treated in Kodak Hypo Clearing Agent, or other sulfite 
wash aid, or in a 2% bath of Sodium Carbonate, or in 2% Kodalk (sodium 
metaborate).

    Polysulfide toners (Brown Toner, T-8) have the unusual property of 
toning more rapidly as they are diluted or become exhausted. When the 
dilution is very great, or the toner nearly exhausted, it can leave a peach 
or yellow stain in the highlights. Great care must be used in insuring that 
the prints are very rapidly washed immediately after toning since the 
toning actin persists in the wash and can produce stains if not removed 
rapidly. Kodak recommends the use of a wash aid as a sort of stop bath for 
the toner. Agfa recommends something similar for Viradon, I think maybe a 
fixing bath, since Viradon can also cause staining from the same cause.

   I will also put in a plug for Kodak Ektonol developer. Its a non 
carbonate developer (uses borax and hydroxide) for warm toned paper. Its 
very nice stuff made especially for prints to be toned. Its available in 
liquid form as Kodak Ektaflo Type-2. Those who miss the old Selectol will 
find this a superior replacement.

   I hope this stuff is of some help.

Peter, The solution is the dry mount press, but that is not the only important
thing to keep in mind.  It is also important to final dry your prints face
down.  You can dry your prints face up if you are going to tone them after a
bit, but they should be dried face down.  That is really important with larger
prints, 16x20 and 20x24.  They should also be allowed to cool down in a cold
press at ambient room humidity after the dry mount press has been used

You can slightly raise one end of your racks to promote the moisture to drain
off the prints.  Once again it is more important with larger prints..

I never liked the cloths pin idea as it leaves marks on the paper even with
plastic style pins.

I bought my 20x24 press from a newpaper for $25. I though that was an

   I think the weight is the key to making this work.
   I use a procedure similar to that advised by Seal for preparing prints 
for dry mounting.
    First, put a sheet of acid free thick kraft paper in the press and dry 
it out for a couple of minutes. Clean photo blotter will also work.
    Put the print face up on a couple of sheets of the dry kraft paper or 
on a sheet of photo blotter with a sheet of release tissue on the emulsion 
side. Put the whole thing in the press at normal mounting temperature for a 
minute. Start with the press closed but not locked down. After a few 
seconds you can lock it down. Open the press and put the sandwich under a 
sheet of, preferably, aluminum. However, any flat material which absorbs 
heat will do. Leave it there until cool. The prints will be flat and will 
stay flat.
   I've found that some paper, especially Agfa paper, has a tendency toward 
edge frilling. I think this is a manufacturing problem. My memory is that 
the old Ansco papers of yore had the same problem. About the only thing you 
can do about this is to make prints with oversize borders and trim the 
frilled part off.
   It probably helps to avoid drying paper too fast. There curl and 
frilling is due to the differential shrinkage of the paper base and the 
emulsion. The slower drying helps to keep the shrinking equalized.

With regard to your 1:29 sellenium toning, are you talking about straight
sellenium or the sellenium solution by Kodak?

Bill,  I have seen that with larger prints that have been dried face up, the
paper tends to curl more.  When you go to flatten the print, there is an
unevenness between the paper and the gelatin.  The edges of the print may have
presses into it, a series of  fine crease marks. The size seems to really
matter.  I had never noticed it on 11x14 or small, but with 16x20 and 20x24's I
have seen this happen : ( . Not often though.

Face up does keep the surface away from the screen to avoid chemical
contamination and dust.  It is important to wash your screens from time to time
to help avoid those pitfalls.

I keep my squeegees fresh and don't press down all that hard, but the PF sounds
like it works for you.

The privately-owned darkroom I have been renting for over 1-1/2 yrs has the 
abovementioned enlarger.   After being on for an hour, the enlarger refused 
to work, giving the message "too cold."  

The darkroom owner's conversation w/his contact at ZBE (the manufacturer) 
yielded a sad answer:  the enlarger bulb could be dying (and/or the "heater" 
or some such needing repair), and no more bulbs have been made for close to a 
year.  Seems the mfg. tolerances are so tight that 15 bulbs were junked for 
every 16 made.  Consequently, ZBE has decided not to bother seeking another 
bulb manufacturer, especially since this is an enlarger out of production for 
some time.   

The enlarger finally  started working, but who knows for how long??  The 
darkroom owner is now faced with having to replace the entire head, just 
because these bulbs are no longer available.

Anyone have any ideas??  Thanks.

The easiest  way I know of, and the only way that's really been satisfactory
for me, is to place the print in a dry mount press for about 15 seconds at
about 150 - 200 degrees after drying on a screen or whatever other drying
method you choose. That will fix the edge rippling. The print will still
curl somewhat and that can be fixed by putting the print in a plastic sleeve
or under a book or other weight for a day or two.

yeah, use a substandard bulb and adjust your print times accordingly.

   I ferrotype my single-weight (8x10) prints on an ancient Pakomax drum
dryer (I've seen them for sale cheap at Levine in Boston), weight them under
plate glass when they come off the drum until cool. For presentation, I dry
mount using a Seal Junior prints. And store them in one-inch deep archival
boxes.
   Double weight prints I hang to dry and press under a 14-inch length of
railroad rail (heavy).
   Pretty good results.

	That's strange! I receive 10 times the amount of mail from my other list groups.
Am I missing some Pure Silver mailings? I always thought this group was a bit conservative on it's E-mail traffic. Frankly, I been enjoying the recent upsurge of postings and information on here.

			yours keep up the flow guys and gals,

My thanks to all the list members who supplied information on toning - I 
found all the posts helpful.

May I ask for some opinions? Someone mentioned the use of "hardening" fixer 
before using sulfite toners such as Kodak Brown Toner, yet I've often read 
advice to not use "hardening" type fixers for paper processing. 

Would anyone elaborate on the pros and cons of "hardening" fixer? My 
underlying question is, if the "hardening" fixer actually helps protect the 
emulsion, why not use it all the time?

Thanks in advance for your response.

Why not just put a filter on the incoming e-mail and put it to a folder.
That way
when you want to read it, its in one place and not clogging up your in-box.

I just put "pure-silver@tundraware.com" in the "from" filter of outlook and
it puts
it nicely into the pure-silver folder.

Mission accomplished.

Recently I compared Forte and Bergger papers. In France early this year 
there was some shortage with the Forte paper so I decided to make some
comparison as I have been told that they should be strictly identical. I
made the comparison with the VC warm tone from Forte and the VC CB from
Bergger (supposed to be identical to the VC WT from Forte).I would like to
share with you the results I got with papers. I worked with 24X30cm (9.5 x
12) sheets
1Å∞) the weight of one sheet of both papers is identical :Forte 23.05g
(average of 10 sheets) and Bergger 23.10g (average of 10 sheets). This is
very important because all the other papers ( Ilford VC WT, Kentemere
Kentona, Kentemere VC WT and......) I compared have different sheet weight.
2)Å∞the speed of both papers is identical (very slow)
3Å∞)they both reacted the same way to Maco selenium toning to give a split
toning at the dilution 1+29. Only few papers are able to split tone and at
different selenium concentrations.
So I can say that both papers are strictly identical and are certainly
coming from the same factory (from Hungary).Bergger papers are sold in
several places in Europe and US. Forte is sold in US  as Luminos.
If some one has also observed the same results I would  be please to share
them.
(Please I apologize for the poor English)

I am talking about selenium solution made by Maco. The concentration in 
selenium is higher than Kodak solution 3% in place of 2.

IMHO there is never any reason to use a hardening fixer with paper. Film,
maybe, but not paper.  If you damage the emulsion of a print, which isn't
easy to do, except perhaps when working with large batches, just make
another one. This is obviously not an option with damaged film so a
hardening fixer makes some sense there but, again IMHO and others may
differ, not with paper.

   Paper which has been fixed in a hardening fixer may respond more slowly 
to Selenium and may be harder to bleach in a ferricyanide bleach than 
unhardened paper. This may be more a function of pH than anything else. 
Selenium likes paper to be neutral or alkaline. A bath in wash aid or 2% 
carbonate or Kodalk will fix the pH problem.
   There may be an effect from the alum, it can cause washing times to be 
extended but that is cured by the use of a wash aid.
   Hardening is _necessary_ if the paper is to be toned at elevated 
temperatures, as in Kodak Brown Toner, Nelson's Gold Toner, or traditional 
Hypo-Alum toner. These must operated at 100F or above to tone in any 
reasonable length of time. Few papers are hardened enough in manufacture to 
withstand these temperatures. In fact, the old instructions for some toners 
specifically warn that the paper must be given an auxilliary hardening.
   Bleaches can also soften emulsions, the effect depending mostly on the 
pH. Some bleach formulas contain hydroxide, likely to really soften emulsions.
   Paper seems to vary in hardness all over the place. In my experience 
Kodak papers are reasonably hard, Agfa emulsion is very soft and tends to 
frill or even come off the subbing if gotten too hot.

   At some point someone with the time should do a Richard Henry type of 
test on the effects of hardeners on all the more popular toners and on a 
sufficient variety of paper to cover the variations.

  I deleted the original so can't check. I suspect this person has a 
mailing service like AOL where mail stays on the server. Many newcomers to 
e-mail don't understand the difference between storing mail on the server 
and storing in on a local machine. With a service like AOL there is a 
limited amount of disk space available to the subscriber. If he/she doesn't 
periodically delete mail from the server it will begin to reject new mail. 
Probably all of us have had error messages come back saying somthing like 
"Message undeliverable, subscriber's mail box full."
   Internet services are not simple and, IMHO, many  ISP's don't provide 
even the basic information to their subscribers about how it works.
   Curiously enough many tasks have become harder to do with technological 
progress. Note the telephone. Seventy years ago it was necessary only to 
pick up the receiver and ask the "voice with a smile" for the number you 
wanted (or even just the person by name where the system wasn't too big). 
Then came the dial phone requiring a little more work on the part of the 
caller. Now we have push button phones with all sorts of auxilliary 
funcions and "voice mail" an abomination which attempts to replace human 
intelligence with lists of things.
