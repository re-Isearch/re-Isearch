Hi John
It could appear that way, but actually it's pretty long-lived. It looks
exhausted because it starts off brown even when fresh. I have never been
able to fathom out the developing agents in this brew - I only know that
there are more than one, but even my friend inside Ilford won't give me any
kind of lead on the constituents. There were rumours that it contained
Ascorbic acid a long time before Xtol appeared.
I think the small pack size is because it's intended to be an amateur pack.
It has changed formulation a couple of times to my knowledge since it was
first introduced in the 1970s when it first emerged. It has always been in a
300ml pack only. I am pretty sure it was a straightforward Phenidone
one-shot developer, but it has always given particularly sharp results.
That's unusual for a Phenidone formulation. As a matter of interest, Ilford
recommend in their technical information sheets, of all their developers,
Ilfosol S for "maximum sharpness", "finest grain" and "best overall image
quality" with FP4 Plus. It's just a particularly happy combination.
I have customer who uses a lot of this developer - for instance with APX100
and APX25 -= and he gets VERY nice results. I tried it with good results too
with Verichrome Pan.
Shame they couldn't stretch to a one litre pack.

Barry,
Isn't the small pack size of Ilfosol because it has a pretty limited shelf
life after it's open?

Can't you get ahold of a MSDS safety sheet that is required here in the USA?
That should tell the ingredients even if it doesn't have the proportions.

Previous thread snipped...

  Ilford has finally gotten MSDS for its products posted. The site is
linked to the Ilford site at http://www.ilford.com  Follow the links from
the home page, you will need Adobe Acrobat reader (freeware).
  The MSDS for Ilfosol-S shows the following ingredients:

CAS No.:     CONTENTS:     INGREDIENT NAME:
7757-83-7    1-5 %         SODIUM SULPHITE
497-19-8     1-5 %         SODIUM CARBONATE
123-31-9     0-1 %         HYDROQUINONE
13047-13-7   0-1 %         1-PHENYL-4-METHYL-4-HYDROXYMETHYL-3-
-PYRAZOLIDONE
134-03-2     1-5 %         SODIUM ASCORBATE
67-43-6      0-1 %         DIETHYLENETRIAMINE PENTAACETIC ACID-
NA5
95-14-7      0-1 %         BENZOTRIAZOLE
86-93-1      0-1 %         PHENYLMERCAPTOTETRAZOLE
127-09-3     0-1 %         SODIUM ACETATE


 I've had to reformat this from the data sheet. I hope it stays readable.
  This is an odd concoction. It is about the only packaged film developer
with carbonate as the accelerator. The Phenidone is the same form Kodak
calls "Dimezone", supposed to be more stable than the original. 
  I don't know the purpose of the mercaptan. 
  It is also interesting that it contains both Hydroquinone and Ascorbic
acid. As a reducing agent Ascorbic acid has properties similar to
Hydroquinone. It is superadditive to Phenidone. I wonder why they need both. 
  The amount of Phenidone needed in developers is very small. That tends to
cause problems with shelf life since the vulnerability to oxidation is
pretty high. There is also some hint in the patent literature that
Phenidone based developers may be sensitive to iron in the water. If there
is lot it may be enough to overwhelm the EDTA. 
  It is interesting to compare this to the simplicity of Xtol.

what about using the FOOD SAVER vacuum sealer to store chemicals?  you can

Can't you get ahold of a MSDS safety sheet that is required here in the USA?
That should tell the ingredients even if it doesn't have the proportions.


Dan
Thanks for the suggestion. There is no such requirement here in the UK for
detailed safety information sheets, nor open public access to patent details
(the culture of government condoned secrecy here is a scandal). I don't know
how to go about obtaining an MSDS sheet, or whether one would be sent from
the US to the UK. Frustrating!

Barry,
I normally rate FP4 ISO 50 and develope in Perceptol  @ 1 to 1 for two thirds 
of the manufacturers recommended dev. time. The results I get are very good 
indeed and are similar to HP5 rated at ISO 200 in the same dev.

  Barry, you should be able to contact the Ilford web site and download the
MSDS from the referred site. It has both US and UK MSDS. I don't know the
law in the UK but MSDS are available for most products there. I suspect
there is some international law at work here.
  I posted a copy of ingredients from the US version of the MSDS to this
list earlier. 
  US patents can be found on the web site of the US Patent and Tradmark
Office. They go back about twenty years. The URL is http://www.uspto.gov
There is also an intellectual property site operated by IBM which also has
patents on it, using the same database. I don't have the URL handy. A
search using Google should turn up other sites. I am pretty certain there
is a UK site. 
  I don't understand how a patent can be kept secret. 
The whole idea of patents is to make new technology available by giving the
patent holder (not this is not the inventor) a right to a period of legal
monopoly, usually 17 years. After that patented technology become public
property. If you have some process that you think has a longer potential
life its better to protect it as a proprietary processor trade secret.
There is considerable protection under the law for trade secrets. Of cours,
if someone else discovers the same process independantly, there is not much
you can do. However, the formula for Coca-Cola has been a successfully kept
secret for over a century so it can be done. 
  Kodak used to rely heavily on trade secrets but some time ago began to
rely more on patents since the expected life of new technology was not
expected to be as long as in the past, and it was easier for someone else
to simply discover the same thing. 
  As you probably know the rights of a patent holder are basically that
he/she can defend the validity of the patent in court, its actually a
rather limited patent. 
  The history of patent litegation is filled with astonishing cases,
sometimes ligated for purely personal reasons, as was the case with the
patent suit procecuted by RCA against Edwin Armstrong on the basic patents
for FM broadcasting. RCA's attorneys protested to David Sarnoff many times
that the RCA position was wrong but it wasn't until years after Armstrong's
suicide that the court decided in his (actually his widow's) favor. Another
curious instance is the suit not too long ago by Polaroid against Kodak for
infringement of its instant photo patents. Kodak lost but most experts
believe that they would have won had they simply persisted. 
  Heigh-Ho. In any case, if you do a patent search on the USPTO site you
will find a staggering number of patents for developers containing Ascorbic
acid and/or Phenidone derivatives.

 Left out a part. Armstrong and Sarnoff started out as close friends.
Armstrong's invention of the Super Hetrodyne circuit was one of the most
important in the history of electronics. However, Armstrong was evidently
the possessor of a very difficult personality. After a time he and Sarnoff
became quite bitter enemies. Sarnoff had RCA pursue the FM patent
infringment case for decades simply out of personal pique. He also did
everything in his power, which was considerable, to kill FM broadcasting
and discourage other exploitation of the process. Armstrong was the single
largest individual stockholder in RCA at the time the patent litegation was
started. He was nearly bankrupt at the time of his death, mostly from legal
costs. 
  When Armstrong jumped out of a window of his apartment in New York
Sarnoff was very disturbed, protesting to an aid "I didn't kill him".
Pretty clearly, he felt he had. 
  Armstrong' widow eventually prevailed and RCA had to fork over a bundle,
but the whole thing was pretty shameful. 
 Phenidone sounds like its something to take for an upset liver.

Having spent the last 6 weeks laid up (low?) at home in damp old West Sussex
(UK), with a badly smashed knee, I've had plenty of time to reassess the
outcome of the last 2 years of b&w work. Not a pretty sight. In fact, if I
had been able to, I'd have taken a running jump off Worthing Pier!! 

So I read and re-read my collection of Ed Buziak's excellent Darkroom
User/Camera & Darkroom, and did the same with my personal (edited) archive
of pure-silver posts. As I read the frank, intelligent and sometimes
passionate views expressed through the list, I realised that working in
isolation, not knowing a single other photographer, had caused my head to
disappear so far up my own backside that any vision I might have had was
probably being clouded by my breakfast coming towards me.  I even tried
going to my local camera club, but was far too young at 50 going on 29, and
not really interested in inter-club "slide battles". Ho hum, never mind. 

I just wanted to thank you all, because, even though I thought I didn't know
another photographer, I realised I actually knew lots, you lot in fact. I
hope now I can look at my prints, not as a father who was there at their
conception and birth, but as a stranger would, and judge them on their
merit,  or more normally, lack of it. 

Once again, many thanks to you all

John

I usually read this list, and gain quite a bit of useful info. 
At this point, I would like to ask if anyone on this list, has any 
experience(s) of filing out negative carriers(using a jewlers file and emory 
cloths to rid the burrs caused) to the point where the numbers will be 
printed and the full frame is used . 
I know some may scoff at this, and I know it is used mostly in conjunction 
with 35mm formats, and some medium format , and was quite a popular way to 
print back in the late 60's and 70's.

Part B of this question is, : Does anyone know about making their own 
negative carriers for this process ? . If so, what materials were used, what 
was the most efficient method , etc? 

I have 35mm, 6X7cm and 4X5 carriers for a Beseler 45MXT enlarger, I know one 
can purchase full frame 35mm carriers from  Freestyle, but the cost is about 
$ 85.00 for the carrier , and I was hoping it could be done another way in 
terms of materiel , and method. To date, I have experimented a bit using 
Foam-Core cut the size of my carriers, and painted black, but am looking for 
something a bit more sturdy, plus I dont want to ruin the negative carriers I 
have now until I know exactly what  I am doing with more confidence.
I would appreciate any advice, and PLEASE email me directly , rather than the 
list, to save other people time . 
Thanks,

  I would only caution that the more material that is removed from the
carrier the less there is to hold the film. If you want to show the whole
negative to the edges and still hold it reasonably flat use a glass holder
and an oversize mask. 
  I am pretty sure this is not what you want to hear.

It's pretty easy to make a negative carrier like this out of mat board if
you have an existing carrier from which to work. Just make a paper template
of the carrier by tracing the exterior of it on a sheet of paper. Then use
the template to cut the two sides of your new carrier out of mat board with
an xacto knife.  Once you have the exterior done you make the hole for the
negative any way and any size (within reason) you want. Some people like to
leave the edges of the hole a little rough or uneven, others prefer that it
look more like a "real" negative carrier. A guy at the school where I teach
gives templates for the shcool's enlargers to the beginning photography
students each semester. They then make their own carriers from the templates
or he'll do it for them for $5.

Just wondering if there is _ANYONE_ out there still doing B&W film via
inspection.  I used to be a B&W film Developer in NYC doing film by hand
and inspection.  

I'd like to get in touch with some people who still do that and try to
keep skill around.  Perhaps we could share some stories, tips, and so
on....

Eric you must have worked with Gar at Lab One.  He's the only guy I know 
still does inspection.  Iy is a good practice at a lab because you never 
know what photogs are sending you.  I used to do it but have switched to 
pyro/jobo.  When I did use inspection; I did the ole "look at the shadow of 
your finger" for base density of acceptable highlight.

I added the detaiol about what this survey is about, because I hadn't opened
this heading before.

Nomatter, I develop by inspection because all too often, I under expose and
need to push my film; sometimes I over expose because I forget to reset my
diaphram using the 8X10, with barrel lenses, settin gup and photographing in
rush hour traffic in the middole of the roadway ... a-hem; to continue.

Sometimes I forget to reset the diaphram from f 11 to f 64, which is what I
establish my exposure time; and therefore I catch those, um ... errors
before they ruin a rare edxposure that mess up a potential portfolio.

I use the 'oh, oh shadows -- D Max of the neg (actually the highlights) --
are still mottled method and with my finger I get the official, 'hmmm, maybe
that's a'good' result.

I'm now using pyrocetchen, by inpsection; and it's a hoot because it goes
into a citric acid stop bath to finish it; while it could go into a SOD
Metaborate or Borax bath to slow it while I contemplate the result.

I do some single sheets to as many as 16 sheets at a time.  By inspection,
I'm like a one armed paper hanger, sometimes; and in the dark, too.

I laugh a lot.

No, not there.   I worked at Lexington Labs.  Me and Emmanuel Asante were
2 or the 3 in NYC that I knew who did it.  The other guy was the guy who
trained Emmanuel and opened up a lab in the East Side.  Can't remember his
name.  

The client list at Lex was impressive:
	Bruce Weber
	Annie Liebovitz
	Stepen Meisel

	Peter Beard
	Demarcheier`
	Bert Stern
..and a bunch more I can't even remember.

The lab founded the magazine "Blind Spot" and website of the same name.

The ingredients are available on the Ilford website, but you will need a pdf
reader to access the files. If you don't already have this software on your
computer, it is available as a free download on www.adobe.com/acrobat.
Feel free to contact me direct if you are unsure as to how to do this.

I am about to try Perceptol developer again. Haven't used it for many years.
I'll be using HP5+ (120) rated at 200. Ilford don't give any times for an EI
of 200 . Am I going to be somewhere close if I use the published times for
an EI of 400 and develop for 30% less time? Any tips about this combination
will be most welcome.

snipped.......................

Depending on the nature of the images and the film I do on occasions.  To
produce negs on unknown film I will start this way until I establish a time
for basic development. Michael Smith and Paula Chamlee teach this technique
in their workshops and many of their students I'm sure will use inspection
as a standard. I now use a Jobo with the large format drums { 3000 series }
and find that I prefer it for repeatable accuracy. My problem with
inspection is that I find it easy to watch the midtones come in and get the
right time for this to occur but have trouble getting exactly the right time
for the highlights { areas on negs that will print as highlights }. It seems
very hard for me to tell the precise density needed when the tones start
getting very dark, I've tried a couple of "blind" test where I would start
one neg 10% before another and at the normal time for the film/developer
combination would try to tell the difference......not able to with any great
accuracy. I would be able to get close but not close enough to be within 1/2
to 1 paper grade. I do like the technique and probably would use it if I
could see the slight differences needed to get the highlights perfect.

I'm back from my swamp and marsh trip and thank everyone again for the help!
I've got a stack of FP4+ to develop and even threw in a few rolls of
Verichrome and a couple of HP5+ also. I will say that after several years of
99% 8x10 work it sure was fun to bang away with the 645 camera. I use a 15
foot tall tripod and shoot from a canoe often and the reflex camera was a
real treat to work with. Really made things great to be able to shoot from
the rear of the camera instead of having to mark the axis of the tripod head
and swing the camera towards me and set the shutter and f/stop then swing
the camera back to its original position.!! Now all I have to do is work out
my developer times and I'm home free!!    I was lucky enough to catch huge
flocks of migrating Snow Geese feeding in the marshes.....can't wait to get
the negs done!
Thanks,
Chuck

I print quite often full frame 35mm/6x6 using an oversize carrier like this
to show frame edges. I haven't had to file out a carrier fortunately - the
thought makes me quite nervous since my handyman skills are limited. What I
found was that many glassless negative carriers have a bottom plate that is
made oversize. The top plate is the one that actually slightly crops the
negative format. If I replace the top plate with a glass, I get a carrier
that simultaneously holds the negative properly flat and gives me the black
border key line. In fact, as an aside, I get such a line with my Meopta
enlarger with Hasselblad negatives even with the standard top plate of the
carrier because the negatives from this camera are noticeably smaller than
other 6x6 cameras.
I don't know whether the Beseler carriers have the oversize bottom plate,
but it is worth checking.

Thanks for your input David.
For HP5 Plus I use Perceptol at 1:2 and 24C to keep times reasonable. I
rate the film at 160 and develop for an 'N' time of 13 to 14 minutes
depending on the enlarger I am using. When I am using the Meopta with double
condenser I give only 12 minutes. Agitation is constant for the first 30
seconds, then at 10 seconds each minute after that.
Looks like you would need  about 15 minutes for EI 200, but you will find
the developer very forgiving with the highlights staying nicely transparent
and graduated even if you over develop at little.
Hope that helps.

The ingredients are available on the Ilford website, but you will need a pdf
reader to access the files. If you don't already have this software on your
computer, it is available as a free download on www.adobe.com/acrobat.
Feel free to contact me direct if you are unsure as to how to do this.

I am about to try Perceptol developer again. Haven't used it for many years.
I'll be using HP5+ (120) rated at 200. Ilford don't give any times for an EI
of 200 . Am I going to be somewhere close if I use the published times for
an EI of 400 and develop for 30% less time? Any tips about this combination
will be most welcome.

I'm back from my swamp and marsh trip and thank everyone again for the help!
I've got a stack of FP4+ to develop and even threw in a few rolls of
Verichrome and a couple of HP5+ also. I will say that after several years of
99% 8x10 work it sure was fun to bang away with the 645 camera. I use a 15
foot tall tripod and shoot from a canoe often and the reflex camera was a
real treat to work with. Really made things great to be able to shoot from
the rear of the camera instead of having to mark the axis of the tripod head
and swing the camera towards me and set the shutter and f/stop then swing
the camera back to its original position.!! Now all I have to do is work out
my developer times and I'm home free!!    I was lucky enough to catch huge
flocks of migrating Snow Geese feeding in the marshes.....can't wait to get
the negs done!

This is probably the time when in the excitement of capturing great images
on film, you confuse the fixer for the developer and lose the lot! Take
care.
Let's hear how they print eventually, and how you feel about the images
compared to the perfection of a 10x8 negative print.

You can file out a carrier, however, in addition to emory paper
smoothing,
I'd suggest a thin coat of black paint for added insurance, and to
prevent 
reflections from being cast onto the negative. 

If the carriers come apart into two sections, you might consider
enlarging the 
bottom section and using a glass cover plate over the top of the
negative. If you
want to use a masked carrier, just use the original top plate.

The 35 mm Beseler Negatrans may be taken apart, and the metal mask used
to view frame numbers can be removed. The plastic tracks may be trimmed
with
an Xacto knife to give full frame 35 mm. The metal mask can be replaced
if desired.
I don't know if the 120/200 Negatrans permits that modification.

Personally, I'd suggest that you pick up a 4x5 glass carrier for the
enlarger, and use
that instead of filing out a carrier. The 35 mm or 120 film can be placed
in the center, and masked with an exposed and developed sheet of lith
film which has a rectangle cut from the center. The mask is sandwiched on
top of the negative, and will prevent Newton's rings while still keeping
the negative flat.

There are other home-made approaches such as using two sheets of optical
glass with a mask as the carrier, or cutting a bottom section from solid
PC board, and using it with a mask and glass top plate.

If you are just looking for black borders, it might be easier to cut a
sheet of posterboard the size of the print, and set the easel's borders
slightly larger than the posterboard size. After exposure, the
posterboard is placed over the print on one corner, and the edges exposed
to light, and then shifted to the opposite corner, and exposed again to
give black borders.

I have filed out negative carriers with a file, and then finer and finer
sandpaper.  the edges are beveled to minimize reflection
\
 \
  \
___\
negative here
----/
   /
  /
and then spray painted flat black.
	However, a few years ago, after reading _Postexposure_ by Ctien, I went
to a glass carrier in my Beseler 23C XL.  Since the carrier is 6X9, a
35mm negative strip can be printed in it's entirety.  I haven't used
that filed 35mm carrier since.  I recommend glass (w/anti Newtons' rings
glass) carriers.  The glass carrier and a Rodenstock APO lens have
dramatically increased the quality I get from 35mm.
	As a side note, it's interesting how the full frame, black border has
gone from a photojournalist/underground/art approach in the 60's, to new
being featured in upscale corporate advertisements!

Thanks for the "heads up!".
 I've "fixed" the problem of getting the chemicals mixed up
permanently......well so far..:o)
  I use liquid fixer and have it in the tempering bath but never mix it
until I pour in the developer! I sometimes run several tanks at the same
time so this became necessary for me to do in order to avoid just the
problem you cautioned me about. As soon as I pour in the developer the dev.
container goes in the wash sink and I pick up the stop container and either
use water, or for films that need it, a stop bath.  After this I mix the
fixer so my worst mistake will only be fixer first instead of stop. I worked
in a commercial custom dark room for a few years that gave me around 200
rolls and mixed orders of sheet film negs to do each morning and I found
that doing it my way would allow me to run at least 10 tanks at the same
time with no worries with the wrong chemicals. We had a large "dip and dunk
processor but found better results with hand processing { everybody wanted
different developers and + or - development times....bet you know all too
well about that!  :o) }

I am one who learned from Paula & Michael and use the inspection development
for all my LF work these days. 35mm I leave in the tanks as the eyes aren't
good enough to see the fine detail in the tiny negs by the green light.

I have found more success and a much easier time of it with FP4, HP5, TriX,
Bergger 200 and the basic films rather than the newer Tgrain films. The
newer ones are harder for me to read in the dark. If all I did was the newer
films and most likely stuck with only one I could get it down. But going
from FP4 to Tmax 100 makes it difficult. The FP4 is like reading a book in
good light while the Tmax is like trying to do it by candle light from the
next room in comparison.

If I am doing TMax only an have some time I can get it a bit closer but do
find I need to watch the clock to make sure I am getting 'in the ballpark'
to start with as the contrast doesn't show as well as the older style films.

Not having ever done development by inspection, I would think that the 
prudent thing to do would be to develop to the normal time and take it out 
and look at it in the green light.  If it needs more development then 
decide then.  Seems like a risky proposition though, for me personally.

  Perceptol is nearly identical to Kodak Microdol-X. Used full strength
either will yield a film speed of about 3/4 to one stop less than the ISO
speed for normal contrast. When diluted 1:3 the speed becomes the ISO
speed, grain is not quite so fine, and there are noticable adjacency
(acutance) effects.
  Both Perceptol and Microdol-X have nice tonal quality but if you want
fine grain its probably better to use a slower film and "normal" developer
like D-76 or Xtol. 
  The main effect of reducing development time is to reduce contrast. For
Ilford HP and FP films a 30% reduction will result in about a one paper
grade lowering of contrast along with about a 3/4 to one stop loss of speed
if the density range is to remain normal.
  T-Max type films (and probably Delta films also) will change one grade
with about a 20% change in time. This more rapid change in contrast with
development time (or temperature) is one reason some people find these
films touchy.

Anybody out there from the UK interested in a meeting sometime at a mutually
suitable venue.
It would be good to put some faces to names and maybe compare/discuss each
others work.
May add another dimension to our correspondence.

The Perceptol data sheet states for HP5+ at EI200 the same dev.times as for
EI400, namely:

1+0: 11 min
1+1: 15 min
1+3: 25 min

I have no experience with Perceptol and HP5+, only in combination with Pan F,
and the result of that is too
mushy for my taste.

Hello,

I'm somewhat stuck for a dev. time for this film (the 200 asa one) in a dish
of Xtol.
The negs were shot at 100 asa and half need to be developed for platinum,
the other half for gum prints. I've previously used FP4 for 5 mins @20C for
making gum print negs and had very good results.

Any help would be appreciated.

Julian.

Michaeal Smith and Paula Chamlee use and advocate this method. They teach it
in their workshops. I don't know how many students end up actually using it.
After watching Paula's demonstration it seemed sufficiently easy to me that
I've bought a green filter and now need the light housing for it, then I'll
give it a try.

  A couple of notes. Film is desensitized by the developer. Some developers
are better desensitizers than others, Pyro is particularly good. 
  The film should be allowed to develop for at least half of the "normal"
time before examining it. This is to get the desensitizing effect and also
to allow complete decolorizing of the anti-halation dyes.
  Remember you are looking at unfixed film. The halide is translucent but
not transparent, this is apt to make judgement of density tricky.
  Its too bad there are no longer any "pictorial" type orthochromatic films
on the market. They can be developed under a fairly bright red safelight.
It is very instructive to watch the film developing this way. It can be
done with pan film by using a desensitizing dye but I don't know if they
are still made or are available. Agfa made two Pinakryptol Green and
Pinakryptol Yellow. Green had to be used in a forebath, Yellow could be
added to the developer. The name comes from the fact that the dye type was
kept a trade secret by Agfa. 
  The green safelight operates on the principle that the dark-adapted eye
is most sensitive to this color and that conventional panchromatic films
(but not T-Max) have a dip in the sensitivity at around this color. 
  The other thing to keep in mind is that development affects contrast
mainly. If the the exposure is not pretty well controlled what you will get
is film with fairly uniform maximum highlight density but variable contrast. 
  My only point here is that there is nothing magic about development by
inspection. Mor uniform and more predictable results can be gotten by time
and temperature technique. However, it costs nothing to try (other than the
safelight filter) and is IMHO a valuable technique to learn even if you
wind up not using it often.

Would like to remind y'all that the cfm (cubic feet per minute) rating of any
fan is as measured against some specific pressure head.  In general, fans are
rated in "free air", which does not exist if you are filtering the air.  Don't
let a salesman tell you it will move air, it won't.  Buy a blower rated to move
air against the anticipated resistance of your filter (and ducts).

I agree with Richard on this point "More uniform and more predictable 
results can be gotten by time and temperature technique. "  Michael A. 
Smith is probably the best and  most famous of the "develop by inspection" 
advocates in the world.  He has been developing this way for a long long 
time.  25 years or more.  That he teaches it does not make it easy or 
better.  It is simply another way to get to the results that we 
want.  Mainly, film developed to the proper CI for the subject 
matter.  With testing, you can arrive at the same place with Time and 
Temperature.  Again, I am with Richard that it costs nothing more than safe 
light.   Oh, and,of course, film.  IMO, lot of film.  Have fun....

As usual,
Lee Carmichael

Not a silly question if you need the scene w/out the birds.  A suggestion
from psychology, which should sit well w/ the environment:  Try positive
reinforcement instead of negative.  If the birds are of a feather, learn
what attracts them, as in favorite foods.  Dispense same somewhere well
behind camera.  Word travels fast, all birds within the range that will show
up in your print and well beyond will immediately flock to the feast.

All,

I have overexposed a sheet of 8x10 Tri-X by placing Z3 on Z6. Not only that
that brightest highlights were on about Z14.

I recall an interview with Gordon Hutchings in View Camera magazine where he
mentioned a dilute variant of PMK for such situations but for the life of me
I can't find that issue.

Does anyone recall or know the dilution/time he recommended for extreme
compensating development?

Thanks,

Don Bryant

Fair enough question.

I used a dremel tool with carbid bit to do the gross work, a mill bastard
hand file the less gross work and touched it up with small files and
finished off with some fine sandpaper and steel wool.  Not as tough a job
as I would have thought, I have now filed out most of my glassless
carriers.  

To be honest, I still prefer glass carriers.  I get poppping with every
light source, anyway: condensor, Chromega or cold light.  Glass eliminates
more problems than it causes and you can print the numbers, sloppy
borders, etc. to your heart's content.

The real tip with development by inspection is to begin with the time and
temp. and to let it go for 3/4 of the recommended time before inspecting.

Staining and inconsistencies in the developing of negatives take extra time
dealing with repair methods, but not to discount a better negative in the
end.

My thanks go out to all of you who have responded to my query, 
Answers/replies were quite varied , but I did ascertain another/other ways of 
accomplishing my feat ahead of me. At this point I should add I have 
glassless carriers all around the formats, and there are pins on the bottom 
of the carriers which allow the carrier to rest in the enlarger, and allow 
the carrier to be swiveled , I also have used black paint , not only to touch 
up the carriers all of which I picked up at garage sales, and flea markets , 
but to the Foam -Core I mentioned previously . I also have done the border 
idea of using a slightly smaller piece of black cardboard to get the even 
black border, .............. but my primary interest was getting the " 
sloppy/wooly" borders again, the reason being is that I have gone through my 
" archives, " and wanted to print some old work that had the same/similar 
borders, even if it meant reprinting all the works of a certain type of 
project , to get uniformity/consistency , my aim was not to decimate my 
carriers if I could help it, or have to buy  the carriers new,(very 
prohibitive) ,and lastly I did not want to scour the sales/markets as I have 
done to acquire them as  it took me several yrs to get them all at the prices 
I liked.. 

Thanks again one and all who answered my plea, I appreciate them all.. 
Respectfully

There was a lot of discussion recently on just this topic.
One method is to use Rodinal at 1:149 repeat 149 for somewhere between 9-12
minutes with agitation at minute intervals.
May be worth deliberately doing the same with another sheet and giving this
a try.
There was an article last year in View Camera on this technique.

Hi there,
I think your idea about a meet has a lot going for it, I'm certainly

two things jump out at me when I see a 1:149 mix.
One: What volume of this mixture would you need to get
enough Rodinal in contact with the film to actually
develop it?
Two: To get that implied exactness (why not 1:150) you
need to be accurate to 2/100's of a ml in 500 ml of
solution.

Hi.

View Camera, jan/feb 1997 - a conversation with Gordon Hutchings and Phil 
Davis.

He calls it Minus-X development; cut your normat development times in half.
Exposure: He says" Simply read and place only the low values and add 3 
stops to the exposure. Do not even read the highlight values..."

I haven't tried this. I would rather try PMK than Rodinal, IMHO.

Anybody out there from the UK interested in a meeting sometime at a mutually

It would be good to put some faces to names and maybe compare/discuss each
others work.
May add another dimension to our correspondence.

The Perceptol data sheet states for HP5+ at EI200 the same dev.times as for
EI400, namely:

1+0: 11 min
1+1: 15 min
1+3: 25 min

I have no experience with Perceptol and HP5+, only in combination with Pan
F,
and the result of that is too
mushy for my taste.

Willem Falhaber

If you are using Perceptol diluted 1:3 Willem, it should be anything but
mushy. The edge effects with it are very strong.

What a b----y good idea! But after the monsoon season is really over, and
the floods subside. Then there is the threat from the petrol price
protestors. Could go on the train, if they fix the track safety problem
soon. Good idea though. Honest! GEOFF C3 UPP.

Hello Tim,

    You are right I should have said thiourea dioxide or Formamidine
Sulphinic acid. I have ordered the raw materials and I will start
experimenting as soon as I get them.

It is certainly a very good idea. I am located in France but if the meeting
place is not in the north of Scotland I could travel.

Hmmm - I happen to live in Aberdeen, which most people do consider the

Anyone have any advice on precipitating silver from basic ammonium thiosulfate fixer (TF3)?  I can't find anyone who strongly wants to recycle my small quantities so I figure I'll do it myself.  The San Franciscio Bay doesn't need any more heavy metals, see.


Anyone else really like smoked salmon?

I used to get hung up on Rodinal dilutions and how tricky they are to
measure, but 3ml Rod in 450ml of water will be plenty accurate enough.  I
can't answer your first point though. I have used Rodinal at 1:100 and
500ml was plenty good enough to process a 120 roll.

Me too! A venue suitable for all is likely to be the only sticking point
here ..... already we have reps from Aberdeen, Exeter and France!  Now were
everyone to go to the Focus on Imaging show in February we could kill the
proverbial two birds with a single stone (with apologies to the recent
thread about birds and Mono Lake!)

OK. It is an interesting toner in many ways.
As you said it isn't really a toner. It produces its colours by redeveloping
the silver, largely in very finely divided colloidal form. The varying and
small grain size gives the colours but as it is still a silver image you can
still go on to tone in other toners, or to rebleach and redevelop again.

As you would expect, papers do vary in their response. Some will produce
several colours in the print at the same time. The colours change as
development proceeds and so you can fine tune this by balancing the first
exposure and dev against how far you bleach and how far you redevelop or
'tone'. There are more variables than usual so you should keep careful
records otherwise when you get something you like you may not be able to
reproduce it closely.

The choice of bleach used is also important. Bleaches based on chloride and
on iodide give different result to a bromide bleach. More notes!

One interesting and very unusual thing about this toner is that it increases
the density if the tones on the print - especially the dark tones. This can
be considerable - up to nearly two and a half times!
If you make a 'correct' print to start with you may find that it gets much
to dark - although you don't have to keep it in the toner that long (it is
progressive) if you don't want to.
Start by under exposing by about a stop - yes that is right, a whole stop!
And reducing contrast by a grade. That is not a bad ball park to get the
feel of it - although it does depend a lot on which bleach you use. For some
effects I would print a G 2.5 print at G 00 with maximum preflash and a stop
or even two light - watch it build up in contrast and density to the 'right'
amount by the time the colours were right. The iodide bleaches don't
increase density as much, and may even lose it depending on formulation.
They can also redevelop very very slowly (heat does help)

Another unusual thing for a bleach toner is that there is little or no loss
of highlight detail. The reason for printing flat is not so much to protect
highlights but to weaken the blacks which will intensify.

Double bleach tone cycles can sometimes be helpful, especially with weak
iodide effects - and just to add another variation you can alter the bleach
type on the secind cycle.More notes!

You should take care not to bleach and tone in high UV light like sunlight
or new flourescent strip light as you may get some 'printing out' effects. I
ran several tests on this with safe lights and room lights and found no
difference in my darkroom.

Get yourself organised because the toner has a short life. Not as short as
is witten up I find but perhaps two hours from 'start time' Start time
begins about one hour after mixing up as it needs this time to 'activate'.
Not like your usual toners.

The main factors I found affecting results were:
1 Choice of paper
2 Choice of developer
3 Density of print ( enlarger exposure)
4 Length and temperature of 1st development
5 Toner dilution
6 Choice of alkali used in toner
7 Choice of bleach
8 Degree of bleaching (time/dilution)
9 Time in toner (some papers fully toned are quite sickly in colour)
10 Double bleach/tone cycle
11 Addition of small quantity of developer to toner
12 Bleach and redevelop in different developer, then go to bleach and toner

Re 6, I use sod carbonate as an alkali, it keeps it going quite a long time
and you can sometimes revive it by adding more. Stronger alkali will give
different colour again but shorten its working life.

I hope this helps a bit

Hi all:

I  bought the Nova Monochrome (thre slots) some while ago.
Now then, I've been using it during the last year whitout any problems.
Yesterday I was printing in Kentona, some very dark prints and for my surprise, the Honey
comb pattern of the Nova plexiglas was remarcably "printed" in the paper. I was getting
mad. I did all sort of things, even proccesed the print in total darkness, but again, the
pattern was there!
When the developer was strong (i.e. just replenished) the pattern was almost absent.
After a couple of prints,  it became more noticeable
I wonder if someone came to this sort of problem.

regards

Daniel Eugenio

Jeff, I don't see this as simplied axactness.  I read it as 1 unit of
Rodinal with water added to make 150 units, a convenient rounded quantity
that is marked on your graduate.  I see lots of  high dilution ratios stated
at 1 unit below a round number like that.  Your point is correct, extreme
accuracy is not needed.

Per,

Shortly after I wrote my e-mail I looked in the article index at View
Camera's web site and located the article.

I tried it and it appears that I have a printable negative, perhaps a bit
soft.

Thanks for the follow up.

If I am going to use, say D76, Diluted for 1 shot strength, should I still
use 60ml or 2 ounces of diluted developer per 4x5 neg?

Or should I use the EQUIVALENT of 2 ounces of un-diluted developer...????
In a 1:1 dilution, that would be 4 ounces into the tube......

Thank you very much Tim. it would be very useful information to start with
this interesting process. A lot of experimentation in the darkroom is
expected. I will let you know the results when I get the chemicals ( it
could take some time as I ordered the raw material not the ready to use
bottle ).

Daniel - you do need to agitate the print more or less continuously to
avoid theis effect.  I use a heated Nova 4-slot processor which has the
same pattern on the tank walls, and have only noticed the effect when I've
not agitated the print sufficiently. It's particularly noticeable on
Ilfrochrome.

Use a syringe. 1:100 Rodinal for a small Patterson tank is 6cc. 1.150 is

Hi Frank:
         While I have  never used the BTZS tubes, this comes from the 
instructions on their web site.

"4 - (Measuring dev.) While the tubes are tempering in the waterbath, 
prepare the developer, stop bath, and fixer. Be sure the developer dilution 
is correct and bring the solution to your chosen temperature. Pour 60 
milliliters of the developer working solution into each of the extra tube 
caps and return them to their tray receptacles."

Here is where I found it.
http://www.darkroom-innovations.com/BTZS_Film_Tubes/  So, in regards to 
your question, I would think that 2 oz of working would mean mixed 1:1 of 
D-76.

Good luck and for gods sake test before you do important negs and be sure 
to write and tells us how it went.

As usual,
Lee Carmichael

Anybody out there from the UK interested in a meeting sometime at a mutually

It would be good to put some faces to names and maybe compare/discuss each

May add another dimension to our correspondence.

I haven't ever noticed a problem using my three-slot 16x12 nova
processor with conventional processing. However, I have run into
problems with lith redevelopment work - bleaching back a conventional
print (which was made in the processor) and then redeveloping in dilute
lith (in daylight, in a dish). In about 50% of cases a nasty honeycomb
pattern appears during redevelopment, even with continuous agitation
during the initial processing. In his book on lith printing, Tim Rudman
warns that lith processing is notoriously intolerant of inconsistencies
in development. It seems that the nova processors do introduce such
inconsistencies, which are negligible for conventional processing but a
problem for redevelopment. Interestingly, I haven't come across the same
problem with bleaching followed by toning in thiocarbamide - it seems
specific to lith redevelopment, at least in my experience.

Hope that this helps.

Guy

Hi Frank - The 4x5 tubes actually won't hold 4 ounces, 2 is about the
maximum. You put in one ounce of D 76 stock and one ounce of water
(assuming, of course, that you're diluting 1-1 for your working solution).

The developer has to fit into the end cap of the BTZS tube, which limits you to
about 60 ml.  This prevents one from using very high dilutions for which 60 ml
of dilute developer doesn't contain a sufficient quantity of the stock
solution.  You shouldn't have any problem with D-76 1:1, but by all means
experiment with a practice negative first.

I think it is a good idea, perhaps sometime in the new year (when, we hope,
natural and man-made catastrophes might be less  likely?).

Anybody out there from the UK interested in a meeting sometime at a mutually

It would be good to put some faces to names and maybe compare/discuss each

May add another dimension to our correspondence.

Thanks for all the responses for the B&W with inspection.  Glad to see
that people are still doing it.  

Here's the reason why we did it.

You have 2 5Gallon tanks with developer.  Lets say that it is fresh.  You
have 100+ rolls of 120/35mm film.  Thats about 18 120 rolls per basket and
a bunch for 35mm.  

Now after the first batch, lets say you have all of the film in the drkrm,
all the film comes out around normal time/development.  The next batch,
(now I'm sure there is some type of formula here, will take longer).  And
so on , and so on...
	1.  The 5 gallon will decrease in temperature slightly
	2.  The developer will loose strength, but it is still good
	3.  Here's the kicker.  In 100+ film, you will have a mix of
	tri-x, plus-x, hp5, and so on.

So for economies of scale, it is a good system.  _PROVIDING_ that your
inspector is good.  

Stuff that I used to do it for but not anymore, as someone else on the
list mentioned, is large format.  In a commercial environment, it is easy
to damage large format if developed in trays so Jobo is the way to go with
that.

Some tips on doing it:
	1.  Yes, someone mentioned developing normanl and checking with
	the light.
	2.  Build yourself a push button switch on the floor or about knee
	high so your hands are free
	3.  Sit in the darkroom for about 10 minutes *before* you do
	anything so your eyes get accustomed.
	4.  Think TAO!  Just let it happen!

So far (Monday evening) I have had 11 positive responses to this idea
ranging from Aberdeen to France.
Yes Barry I am volunteering to organise this (theres one born every minute).
So would all those who have expressed an interest and have not advised their
town of residence please do so now direct to me at

It may need more than one meeting to cover the spread of locations but we
can see.
The suggestion of Focus next February may be worth considering but the
exhibition I believe will detract attention from the meeting itself .
Please advise any ideas on this or other venues.
After the current UK problems have gone away(floods,petrol etc) plus that
dreaded time of Xmas and the main part of winter may make travelling for
some easier.
I can also offer a bed for at least one long distance traveller if that
helps.
Lets see how it starts to pan out.

Too bad I won't be in the UK anytime soon on one of my occasional
business trips - it would be nice to meet in person.   Oh well, perhaps
next time...

I am repeating here data read from a View Camera article.
I believe the 1:149 is not due to a required accuracy but simply to make
calculating the amount of dev. for a given volume easier.
i.e.one divides by 150 and not 151 (for 1:150).
I cannot answer the volume requirements for a sheet of film but a sensible
experiment on similar exposed test film should verify this for you.

Regards

The commonly quoted formula for FSA is:
Thiourea Dioxide   10G
Sodium Carbonate 10G
Water to.             1litre and stand for 1 hour, active life 1 hour.

However, I have been using 5G Thiourea with 30G sodium carbonate and =
getting
excellent results with an active life of 3 hours or more.
It seems likely that many variations around this will work well.
I would think that your suggested 2.5 G of sod carbonate will be too =
little
though, but it will be enough for the much stronger NaOH - but will give =
a
different colour pallet and shorter working life.
Re papers, it depends on which bleachyou use and what you want. There is =
no
easy answer to this given the great number of permutations. Warm papers =
-
especially with the 'warm' and neutral bleaches - can give very rich =
colours
which I personally don't like, but of course you might. Some papers give
idiosynchratic effects, TT Vario Comfort is nice with several soft =
colours
together. I will be very intersted to hear your results
I will post this one last time to the group in case any lurkers are
interested in this thread. If no one says anything I will keep it off =
list
afterwards.
Anybody interested in this????

This does happen with this unit and you should keep constant agitation going
to prevent it.
It is not a Kentona problem, if you do a lot of bleach and redev you will
find it with many papers.
It also even occurs with dish developed prints which are then washed in the
Nova archival washer. Again, you will never see this unless you get into
bleaching processes, and most of all with lith redev.
The new Nova FB unit has a clear and smooth front face.

Whatever happened to "Blind Spot" - it used to be on sale here in Oz, but I
have not seen it during the past year at least - is it still being

There are several sources for chemical buckets that you pour your fixer into
and after a given time the buckets can be either returned to a processor or
even sold in some cases. Try Eastman's 1-800-242-2424 number and see if they
still offer and help or try a local lab with large processing needs and see
if they will take your fixer. Most local labs that run silver recovery near
me are willing to take small amounts but need some "prodding". You can
purchase an electro-plating silver recovery system but doubt that you could
recover enough to break even for quite a while unless professional amounts
are being run. I worked for a company that had a homemade silver plater that
ran constantly and used aluminum plates that were hooked up to a constant
current that would plate the silver on the aluminum sheets and every so
often we would send the silver to a processor after flexing the plates to
remove the build up.....we stopped due to the risk of electric shock
hazards.This was run from a storage battery that was recharged by a normal
battery charger. Evidently someone was injured by turning the tank over
while the current was on and the company stopped and went to drum
collectors.. The graphic arts community has shows of equipment that include
inexpensive silver recovery tanks and might be an easy to research industry
for this type recovery system. The PICA graphic arts shows last year has at
least 10 under $100 dollar recovery tank systems. I believe you have several
shows in your area.

Subject:  photography trip to USA
Date:  Mon, 06 Nov 2000 22:16:53 GMT
I am currently applying for a Churchill scholarship - available to teachers
- for May, June, July 2001 to photograph in the USA. I lecture in Politics
and am an experienced visitor to the USA (including leading fieldtrips) ,
primarily to Washington, New York and the east coast. Some of my time in the
USA will be spent recording politicians and the political process in
Washington.  But my main aim is to photograph communities in the USA and
especially families, their schools  and the community at rest and play. I
want a wide spread of the country - geographically, urban/rural etc. and
would welcome suggestions and contacts.

The scholarship covers travel and accommodation and I would be grateful if
any offers of hosting arise - either for payment or exchange favours -I'm
based in a lovely part of the UK in Devon. I would be most willing to engage
in colaborative projects.

I have photographed widely all over the world - in China, Russia and all
over Europe and am increasingly working in photojournalism and narrative
photography.

I'm new to this puresilver group - recommended by the brilliant Barry
Thornton at a recent teaching weekend. I've already enjoyed 'tuning in 'to
the exchanges. If you get a chance of being taught by Barry, seize the day
!! An impassioned man whose knowledge and communication skills are simply
exceptional.

Ian Wright

   I vote for posting all to the list. I gather that Thiourea dioxide is
not the same stuff as used in thiourea or thiocarbamide sepia toners as a
odor-fee replacement for sulfide.

This may seem rude, but I have some BTZS tubes that i would like to sell. I

Thanks to all for pointing out the BTZS instructions, the size of the cap,
etc.   ALl good answers....

The question really was about the exhaustion of the developer in such small
volumes...

Let me rephrase the question......

Does 60 ml of D76 ( in a diluted state of 30ml of D76 plus 30ml of water)
have sufficient chemical power to develop a negative of 20 square inches?
Will the developer be exhausted before the development is complete?

Maybe ditto any other developer....????

This is correct Richard, it is said to be safer than thiocarb - but not as
archivally stable. Swings and roundabouts.

The BZTS tube is a useful alternative to tray development.

The formula is two ounces per 10 sq inches of film surface.  Therefore, for
the 4X5=20 sq inches that equals 4 ounces of WORKING SOLUTION.

If you have to pour more inside the tube, for expanded development, so be
it.

I made 8X10 tubes from PVC Pipe and simple cut them so they would hold 16
ounces for expanded development.

One Shot Developer?  Isn't all developer one shot by this formula?  I tried
pushing Edwall FG 7 beyond the formula and had to bleach and re develop 175
negatives.

That's very interesting.

Well, there's one fact every 'commercial' film developer should know, by
now.

After the first 3/4 development time you can actually turn the lights on.

AFAIK, Kodak only provides recommendations for the required amounts of stock
solution for their XTOL developer.   For XTOL, publication J-109 specifies
at least 100 ml of full-strength developer be used (regardless of dilution)
per 80 square inches of film.  This means at least 25 ml per 4x5, and so with
the limit on the amount of diluted developer of 60 ml imposed by the BTZS tubes,
you can't go much beyond 1:1 dilutions: 25 ml : 35 ml which is 1 to 1.4.

As I said previously, I don't think that you will get into trouble with D-76
diluted 1:1, but the only way to be sure is to try it out.  Something like
1:3 might be problematic for general purpose development.

I use BTZS tubes for 4x5 developing and find them to work very well.

It may need more than one meeting to cover the spread of locations but we
can see.
The suggestion of Focus next February may be worth considering but the
exhibition I believe will detract attention from the meeting itself .
Please advise any ideas on this or other venues.
After the current UK problems have gone away(floods,petrol etc) plus that
dreaded time of Xmas and the main part of winter may make travelling for
some easier.
I can also offer a bed for at least one long distance traveller if that
helps.
Lets see how it starts to pan out.

I am in Chepstow as you know already John. Aberdeen residence is going to be
a travel challenge for anyone I am afraid, but otherwise Birmingham proves
to be a very good central point in the UK with excellent communications. I
agree about Focus itself being a distraction. I was thinking that
immediately before or after focus might be a good idea, but I assume we will
need to have a weekend meet, and that doesn't fit with Focus. Also, I may
well be working at Focus anyway, and the days before will be involved with
set up and preparation.

Focus actually starts on a Sunday, so the Saturday could be given over to a
meeting?  Your point about set-up etc is well taken though - I may well be
in the same boat!  The problem with any meeting such as this is finding a
suitable venue, and Focus provides a ready made one but I admit the
exhibition itself might be a distraction.  It rather depends on what we
want from such a meeting - a social chat or something a bit more in depth?
Perhaps we ought to take this off list to save boring our friends outside
the UK?

I've been using D 76 diluted 1-1 in the 4x5 tubes for quite a while. It
works fine, no exhaustion problems.

To this, below and the other query I tried answering on my experience with
my home made 8X10 tubes, which are much larger than the BZTS tubes sold
retail.

The design, as I understand, is meant to offer enough room for chemistry to
1) slosh around and 2) fully develop the negative NORMALLY AND NO MORE.  So,
the question of expanded development is answered by suggesting to use a
developer that can be mixed for single use such that it will expand or
dilluted such that it will under develop according to what you know as the
exposure.

D76 at 1:1 is expansion, as I recall from college days when last I used it;
and at 1:3 is minus development.  So, if you can only add 2 ozs or 60ml,
then you make it porportionate with water to developer to fit the amount
into the tube.

Close answer?  I just began with Windich pyrocetchen developer and it
expands or contracts depending on the mixture, same volume and same
temperatures.

Focus actually starts on a Sunday, so the Saturday could be given over to a
meeting?  Your point about set-up etc is well taken though - I may well be
in the same boat!  The problem with any meeting such as this is finding a
suitable venue, and Focus provides a ready made one but I admit the
exhibition itself might be a distraction.  It rather depends on what we
want from such a meeting - a social chat or something a bit more in depth?
Perhaps we ought to take this off list to save boring our friends outside
the UK?


This Saturday could work out if other people are agreeable. You are right
Richard - we should go off the pure-silver list to stop boring those not
involved. The trouble is I forgot to note who the people were!
One idea I had was that each attendee could give a 10 minute, say, (short
anyway) presentation on any topic they liked related to monochrome
photography. This could be anything from a show of some favourite prints to
the demonstration or explanation of an interesting taking, processing, or
printing technique or aesthetic issue. This needn't be a public speaking
tour de force - simply an informal chat.
Also, we might prepare some simple topics in advance for a discussion forum,
or even a debate e.g.. 'darkrooms are dead - serious photographers should
stop clinging to the past and take the lead into digital technology'. Each
participant might bring a topic to the discussion forum to be raised in
turn.
We might even do some photography if any participant, for instance, were
interested in portrait work (Polaroid 5x4 type 55?)

It's not my opinion - I've never kept any for long enough. But pg 9 of that

doc Richard quotes gives the shelf life of a half full bottle as three

months. Compare that to Rodinal. Somewhere in a remote village in the Harz

mountains the original 1891 flask of Rodinal is being eked out by the Agfa

hermit, 1.100. It's still half full. He may never use it all.>>

what about using the FOOD SAVER vacuum sealer to store chemicals?  you can
use to seal bags or jars airtight .  I have one for the kitchen and it is
truely an amazing gadget.

Mike
Three months for a part used bottle is about par for the course for normal
developers. Some like Rodinal or PMK aren't normal. I sometimes wonder about
the people who use them too!!
The FOOD SAVER gadget sounds intriguing. Exactly what is it, and where did
you get it from. I don't recollect seeing one in the UK, but perhaps other
UK pure-silver people could correct me on that. The thought of being able to
vacuum seal some of my stock solutions in thick brown glass bottles is
interesting.

What has been the experience of list members with Pyro (specifically PMK) in
BTZS?  This is a combination that I have been thinking of using.  I had not
realized that people were experiencing problems.

This may seem rude, but I have some BTZS tubes that i would like to sell. I 
bought them then found out they do not work with Pyro so well, so I got a 
jobo.  I have 5 of 4x5s and two of 8x10s.

Well for those of you who subscribe, I wrote this toner up a couple of
months ago for Photo Art. It should be in the next issue.

It's changed a bit since I first used it several years ago without the wider
choice of bleaches

Barry,

I've not heard of a Food Saver, but you might like to look into the
'Vacu-Vin' system - I bought mine from Debenhams, but I've seen them in many
kitchenware and home brewing shops. They are designed to keep wine fresh
once a bottle has been opened - never a problem in this house :-)

The basic components are a simple hand operated pump, and rubber stoppers
with a one way valve. The stoppers push perfectly into the neck of a 300ml
medicine bottle - or a wine bottle, its intended use. A few swift strokes of
the pump extracts the air, leaving a vacuum. To remove the stopper, simply
squeeze it and the valve opens. You know it's worked by the hiss as air
rushes into the bottle. Simple, inexpensive, and effective! And a great
excuse to empty wine bottles!

 Richard

  Gents, fwiw I routinely develop film in D-76H 1:3 at a proportion of 2
oz. per 20 sq in, whether sheetfilm with continuous rotary agitation or
rollfilm with intermittent agitation; curve shapes and speeds are identical
to the 1:1 dilution, of course using a longer development time for 1:3.

Hey Brian- thanks for asking.  I still have them in the original box, and as 
I said I never used them.  I will have to look in the box for the original 
receipt.  They were very expensive but I will part with them for a 
reasonalble price.  give me a couple of days.  I will be shipping from NYC, 
so tell me your region so I can include that in the price.  Thanks

Along the same lines, I use a wine bladder. I have purchased a supply from a
wine maker here. They are excellent for keeping dilute HC110.
I have also had the pleasure of drinking the wine then cleaning the bladder
and using it, just expel the air once filled and replace the stopper. It
works ok.

I just wish that 1 litre bottles had decent wine in them ;-)  Phil Brown's
idea about the bladder is worth a look too - presumably that's the innards
of a wine box which would hold up to 3 litres, a Nova slotful!

I've not heard of a Food Saver, but you might like to look into the
'Vacu-Vin' system - I bought mine from Debenhams, but I've seen them in many
kitchenware and home brewing shops. They are designed to keep wine fresh
once a bottle has been opened - never a problem in this house :-)

The basic components are a simple hand operated pump, and rubber stoppers
with a one way valve. The stoppers push perfectly into the neck of a 300ml
medicine bottle - or a wine bottle, its intended use. A few swift strokes of
the pump extracts the air, leaving a vacuum. To remove the stopper, simply
squeeze it and the valve opens. You know it's worked by the hiss as air
rushes into the bottle. Simple, inexpensive, and effective! And a great
excuse to empty wine bottles!


Thanks Richard, I'll try it out - the stopper system I mean, not the wine.

Along the same lines, I use a wine bladder. I have purchased a supply from a

I have also had the pleasure of drinking the wine then cleaning the bladder
and using it, just expel the air once filled and replace the stopper. It
works ok.

It's beginning to sound as though there is some connection between alcoholic
beverages and photography! Tough for a tee-totaller like me. I would just
have to find someone to force my spare wine on to.

Hi, Ian ...

If you're going to be in the southwest, we live in a beautiful area of the
Arkansas Ozarks. I will be off from my college counseling job in May and
June and could probably show you around. This area is pretty remote. Closest
towns of 12-15,000 are 45 miles away. There's more scenery here than people
but the latter are about as interesting a bunch as you'll find anywhere--old
timers who still use some Elizabethan speech patterns and homesteaders who
are aging hippies from the 60's. They get along amazingly well.

We usually have some extra room and pretty good food.

Come see us.

Charles Ellis

Subject:  photography trip to USA
Date:  Mon, 06 Nov 2000 22:16:53 GMT
I am currently applying for a Churchill scholarship - available to teachers
- for May, June, July 2001 to photograph in the USA. I lecture in Politics
and am an experienced visitor to the USA (including leading fieldtrips) ,
primarily to Washington, New York and the east coast. Some of my time in the
USA will be spent recording politicians and the political process in
Washington.  But my main aim is to photograph communities in the USA and
especially families, their schools  and the community at rest and play. I
want a wide spread of the country - geographically, urban/rural etc. and
would welcome suggestions and contacts.

The scholarship covers travel and accommodation and I would be grateful if
any offers of hosting arise - either for payment or exchange favours -I'm
based in a lovely part of the UK in Devon. I would be most willing to engage
in colaborative projects.

I have photographed widely all over the world - in China, Russia and all
over Europe and am increasingly working in photojournalism and narrative
photography.

I'm new to this puresilver group - recommended by the brilliant Barry
Thornton at a recent teaching weekend. I've already enjoyed 'tuning in 'to
the exchanges. If you get a chance of being taught by Barry, seize the day
!! An impassioned man whose knowledge and communication skills are simply
exceptional.

Thanks for this Tim. I have subscribed to Photo Art International  since
Roger Maile took the magazine over, and look forward to the next issue.
PAI, together with Ed Buziak's Camera & Darkroom, is essential reading.

Can soombody tell me if my developing times sound right? I'm shooting
Delta100 at EI100, developing in Ilfosol-S at 1+14 dilution, 68F. I print
with a condensor enlarger. Development time seems to be about 7 minutes.
Just need to check if this sounds reasonable or there may be something else
wrong in my system. The Ilford data sheet for the film suggests 10 minute
development.

So far I have 24 interested parties including myself-so quite a large group
if everybody turns up at the 'first' meeting.
I need the personal e-mail addresses of Richard Saunders, Ian Wright, Helge
Naried and Daniel Eugenio.Could they e-mail these to me direct at
johnhrhodes@btinternet.com.

Once I have these this idea can then be discussed off the pure-silver site
as suggested.

Some form of meeting around Focus is gaining momentum so perhaps this could
be first contact to establish what most people want to get from say a
weekend meeting. Not all would need to attend this but those who don't could
make their views known in advance.

JR

Focus is a very large photographic exhibition held at the National
Exhibition Centre in Birmingham England each year usually in February.
All of the large names in photography are there with many workshops run
simultaneously with the exhibtion.

Hey come on guys... I know WE don't do anything so stupid as sipping from
interesting wine (and soda) bottles in our darkrooms... but those containers
shouldn't be there in the first place. There's regular threads on this list
as to whether Pyro is safe or not in unsupervised darkrooms, but I think
that having domestic bottles reused for chemical storage in our darkrooms is
potentially far more dangerous... especially to other unsuspecting folk.

BTW: I'm way behind on answering pure-silver user's messages and queries
because the January 12th 2001 date for our move to France is fast
approaching... and there's a lot of paperwork involved.

John,

Focus would be the ideal venue for a Pure-Silver meeting... there will be so
much DI (Digital Irritation) at the show you'll all have plenty of time
during the show to talk about and compare your own portfolios of the real
pure-silver stuff...  <evil smirk>

How do your prints look? If they are just fine then the times are OK also.
If not, tweak the times to give you what you want as results.

You CAN'T rely no others times for anything but a rough guide. Water quality
has more effect than many realize on processing. Take my times from an area
where the water is so hard it wears down mountains compared to a location
where it is softer than the booze laden brain of George W and you get
different times using the same film & chemistry.

Let your results guide you.

I recently tried Ilfosol  after having read so many good things about 
it here, and these are my conclusions. But I am a 35mm guy, who uses 
Leitz ASPH lenses and likes his 10-16x enlarged prints dead sharp, 
believing that today's film are fine grain enough and acutance is the 
thing to go for. So my interpretation may be different from yours.

Here we go: Ilfosol 1+9, temperature, agitation and times as per 
Ilford's recommendations

Delta 100: less sharp in Ilfosol than it is when exposed at 200 and 
developed in Xtol 1+1 for 13 mins, grain is similar. One stop more 
speed is worth a lot to me. Ilford does not recommend Ilfosol for 
Delta 100 shot at 200

FP4+: I shot a series of grey cards at ei 125, measured the densities 
and plotted them. There was a constant underexposure of one stop 
compared to the graphs I have done for other films. With an ei of 64 
this combination can't beat Delta 100 at 200 in Xtol 1+1 or Delta 100 
at 100 in Rodinal 1+50 for 15 mins if you want biting sharpness. 
Gradation may be better, but I never printed the negatives due to the 
low speed, and Xtol negatives are very good gradation-wise

HP5+ exposed at 800: curve very similar to Rodinal 1+25 10 mins, but 
I prefer Rodinal's grain and gradation.


BTW; why do you use Ilfosol S 1+14 when Ilford's literature says 1+9 
gives better results? Edge efffect?
Are you sure you are getting any improvement in that area with 1+14?

Anyway, I guess you will have to try this out for yourself. Not only 
may our tastes differ, our thermometers may differ too. And a lot of 
other things. The main thing is that your negatives print well on 
number 2 or 3 paper. All other things,  like manufacturer's 
recommended time and temperature, should just be a helpful starting 
point, but never something to follow blindly.

Just need to check if this sounds reasonable or there may be something else
wrong in my system. The Ilford data sheet for the film suggests 10 minute
development.

Dave,
Your time sounds about right from my experience, but not the film speed. I
find it rates at EI 50/ 64 with this combination. Ilford's times are OK for
the usual colour head enlargers with diffuser lighting, not for condenser.
the reduction in time you need to accommodate the condenser head's greater
contrast also leads to a drop in film speed.

that having domestic bottles reused for chemical storage in our darkrooms is
potentially far more dangerous... especially to other unsuspecting folk.

I take your point. My interest was in using the vacuum system with my
existing collection of conventional brown glass "Winchester" bottles, not
used wine bottles. As I said, I am TT and thus ignorant of all these clever
devices that seem second nature to the vinoclasts among us.

Hi peeps, I have been lurking for some time now and feel I am now ready for
my first lambasting.

I recently attended a photographer's evening at a steam railway centre
hoping to take some outstanding photographs - Oops.

I had my Minolta 500si Super and my Bronica ETRS. I had taken some shots
with the SLR early on and was waiting for darkness and the floodlights
before I used the Bronica.

At last the floodlights came on and I saw the chance of some good shots of
an engine on a turntable. I set the Bronica up and reached for the light
meter. First mistake, the scale on my meter was not visible in the low light
and I had not brought a torch. I suddenly thought, I know I will use my SLR
to take a light reading and then bracket on the Bronica. I guess some of you
by now will have guessed the deliberate mistake.....

My SLR was loaded with Ilford Delta 3200 and the Bronica was loaded with
Ilford PanF.

My question to the experts is: Is it going to be possible to change the
development times for the PanF film or is it a hopeless case.

Sorry for the long post but we all have to begin somewhere.

Massively Underexposed Ilford PanFWow, Jon, I am a great fan of Ilford PanF
and find that it can forgive a stop or two of underexposure .... but you are
looking at 6 stops if you rated the Delta 3200 at 3200.

It's a lost cause for quality negatives, but you might get something
marginal by letting it cook in Microphen for a long, long time,  but I
suspect even that is a stretch.

Sorry, but these things happen to all of us.

Cheers,

John

an engine on a turntable. I set the Bronica up and reached for the light
meter. First mistake, the scale on my meter was not visible in the low light
and I had not brought a torch. I suddenly thought, I know I will use my SLR
to take a light reading and then bracket on the Bronica. I guess some of you
by now will have guessed the deliberate mistake.....

  My SLR was loaded with Ilford Delta 3200 and the Bronica was loaded with
Ilford PanF.

  My question to the experts is: Is it going to be possible to change the
development times for the PanF film or is it a hopeless case.

  Sorry for the long post but we all have to begin somewhere.

"BTW; why do you use Ilfosol S 1+14 when Ilford's literature says 1+9 
gives better results? Edge efffect?
Are you sure you are getting any improvement in that area with 1+14?"

I'm not sure that Ilford recommends 1+9 dilution. The data sheet I have
shows best grain at 1+14 devlopment. I prefer to use a one-shot developer
and the economy of the 1+14 dilution was also a factor.

Anyway, it sounds like 7-7.5 minutes is reasonable for my setup. I was
concerned since this was so much less than Ilford's recommended starting
point. If this is normal will I be able to get an N-1 development at  what,
about 6 minutes?

Hi
I am not an expert but I have tried pushing PAN-F in
Microphen, even at an EI of 100 I did not like the
pictorial results. A six stop push I would expect to
be beyond any hope. 
Perhaps some lith results with no midtones might be
possible, try just developing the first few frames
first, neat Microphen for 30 minutes would be my
guess.

If you try it let me know as I am curious.

Thanks
Richard

Dave
Ilford doesn't recommend Ilfosol S for best overall results with Delta 100 -
only for finest grain. For best alround performance with a liquid
concentrate developer, it recommends Ilfotech HC. That developer is even
more economical that Ilfosol S of course, but its short development times
mean that working at 1:63 instead of 1;31 gives more control and better
economy, and slightly greater sharpness.
Ilfosol S is only recommended for best sharpness, grain, and speed with FP4
Plus, and I would confirm that from personal trial IF the choice is from
Ilford's developers. Obviously, I am biased towards DiXactol for even better
results.
Watch film speed, however. Distrust all claims that best quality occurs at
EI ratings greater than manufacturer's standard speed, or even at rated
speed. There are comparative pictures in my new book, 'Edge of Darkness', of
prints from FP4 Plus negatives developed in Ilfosol S 1:9. One is at maker's
film speed and development time. The other is at half rated speed with
development time cut by 1/3. There is a VERY significant improvement in the
latter.
DiXactol does work well at maker's rated speed, but not above.
I guess you are already knowledgeable on how to measure personal film speed
with your own equipment, but if you aren't you can find the method set out
on my web site (www.barrythornton.com). You won't need a densitometer to do
this. The 'Unzone System' I describe there may also be helpful. If you are
already au fait with personal film speed assessment, just ignore this stuff.

Hope this helps
Barry Thornton

Massively Underexposed Ilford PanFNot much hope Jon I'm afraid. I would not
recommend stewing it any normal developer, speed increasing or not. Ilford
DDX or Microphen would be OK up to EI 200 to rescue something, but the
contrast would be fierce, and it sounds as though you had contrasty lighting
on the original scene as well.
I would opt for a speed increasing two bath to try to restrain the highlight
density. Diafine for extended times might be a good starting point. With
single bath developers, phenidone developers give high speed at normal
times, but don't do as well as metol developers well diluted for LONG
pushing = 90 minutes or more.
If the film is REALLY valuable to you, and you are prepared to mix your own
chemicals, please email me direct and I will let you have some details of a
two bath formula that will get the very last ounce of speed from the film
while holding back the highlight density. However, I think you are on a
loser with this one really. It must be really frustrating I know.

Hi peeps, I have been lurking for some time now and feel I am now ready for
my first lambasting.

I recently attended a photographer's evening at a steam railway centre
hoping to take some outstanding photographs - Oops.

I had my Minolta 500si Super and my Bronica ETRS. I had taken some shots
with the SLR early on and was waiting for darkness and the floodlights
before I used the Bronica.

At last the floodlights came on and I saw the chance of some good shots of
an engine on a turntable. I set the Bronica up and reached for the light
meter. First mistake, the scale on my meter was not visible in the low light
and I had not brought a torch. I suddenly thought, I know I will use my SLR
to take a light reading and then bracket on the Bronica. I guess some of you
by now will have guessed the deliberate mistake.....

My SLR was loaded with Ilford Delta 3200 and the Bronica was loaded with
Ilford PanF.

My question to the experts is: Is it going to be possible to change the
development times for the PanF film or is it a hopeless case.

Sorry for the long post but we all have to begin somewhere.

Thanks Gary. The American distributor is Amherst - hope I have spelled that
correctly. I can also supply direct from my web site's shop area. The books
are due with me today or tomorrow. I don't know when they reach the States.
I'll have to check with the publisher.

I've been reading conversations about film/developer combinations with 
interest. I use 1600 Neopan as my fast film for wedding photography, 
developing in ID11. Has anybody got any tips/experience for different 
combinations ?

Mr. Thornton: 

Thank you for your response. I think I have a handle on my film speed and
metering technique but did gain some new insight in reading your web
articles. You are never too old to learn a few new things. For example, I
realize that I have always made my test strip in increments to determine
minimum time for black and then gone to one total exposure time based on
that information. Is the error in doing this related to lamp start up times
or due to timer inaccuracy? Or is there another factor similar to
reciprocity effect at play?

"BTW; why do you use Ilfosol S 1+14 when Ilford's literature says 1+9
gives better results? Edge efffect?
Are you sure you are getting any improvement in that area with 1+14?"

I'm not sure that Ilford recommends 1+9 dilution. The data sheet I have
shows best grain at 1+14 devlopment. I prefer to use a one-shot developer
and the economy of the 1+14 dilution was also a factor.

Anyway, it sounds like 7-7.5 minutes is reasonable for my setup. I was
concerned since this was so much less than Ilford's recommended starting
point. If this is normal will I be able to get an N-1 development at  what,
about 6 minutes?

Dave
Ilford doesn't recommend Ilfosol S for best overall results with Delta 100 -
only for finest grain. For best alround performance with a liquid
concentrate developer, it recommends Ilfotech HC. That developer is even
more economical that Ilfosol S of course, but its short development times
mean that working at 1:63 instead of 1;31 gives more control and better
economy, and slightly greater sharpness.
Ilfosol S is only recommended for best sharpness, grain, and speed with FP4
Plus, and I would confirm that from personal trial IF the choice is from
Ilford's developers. Obviously, I am biased towards DiXactol for even better
results.
Watch film speed, however. Distrust all claims that best quality occurs at
EI ratings greater than manufacturer's standard speed, or even at rated
speed. There are comparative pictures in my new book, 'Edge of Darkness', of
prints from FP4 Plus negatives developed in Ilfosol S 1:9. One is at maker's
film speed and development time. The other is at half rated speed with
development time cut by 1/3. There is a VERY significant improvement in the
latter.
DiXactol does work well at maker's rated speed, but not above.
I guess you are already knowledgeable on how to measure personal film speed
with your own equipment, but if you aren't you can find the method set out
on my web site (www.barrythornton.com). You won't need a densitometer to do
this. The 'Unzone System' I describe there may also be helpful. If you are
already au fait with personal film speed assessment, just ignore this stuff.

Hope this helps
Barry Thornton

I think I have a handle on my film speed and

realize that I have always made my test strip in increments to determine
minimum time for black and then gone to one total exposure time based on
that information. Is the error in doing this related to lamp start up times
or due to timer inaccuracy? Or is there another factor similar to
reciprocity effect at play?

Dave
Both lamp warm up and an inbuilt paper characteristic. The latter is called
the intermittency effect, but this is nowhere near as great in effect as the
lamp warm up time. The intermittency effect is minor, and the lamp warm up
time I guess could be worked out as a constant % allowance with a little
trial and error. But since it probably varies with lamp age, current
fluctuations, and paper type, it's probably not worth the effort. I find it
simpler and quicker to use the multiple exposure technique. That's also
useful in the actual print for timing dodging and burning, and for
repeatability of dodging and burning.

Hello from a long time lurker on the list..

Anybody ever use Kodak's Panalure paper? I need to make some b&w prints from
color negs and was wondering how good this paper is. Or can anybody suggest
any other ways to do this.

Thanks
Dean

  Works like a charm. Its used like any graded paper. Processing is exactly
like any B&W RC paper except it must handled in total darkness or under a
#13 safelight up to the fixer. This safelight is just bright enough to
prevent falling over things.
  The results are far superior to what you will get with variable contrast
paper regardless of filter combinations.
  BTW, B&W camera filters can be used with this paper with the same effect
they have on the camera, useful for darkening skys, etc.
  I've used pan paper as a paper negative to make prints from color
transparencies. Maybe not ideal but works surprizingly well.

Richard,

Good tip about the filters! I've been using Panalure in the past, but was
disappointed about the results.
I found the prints too flat and soft, with some colours clearly printing
different from panchromatic film/VC paper combinations, so probably yellow,
red and green filters will make a difference.But I agree that for B&W prints
from colornegs it's better than VC paper.On VC blue and bluegreen come out
lighter, while red, yellow and magenta produce darker tones.Green is more or
less equal, a little darker sometimes.Do you know if camerafilters are useful
for VC paper as well? 
If a colorneg has good contrast and not too much blue in the subject, it's
possible to produce an acceptable print on VC paper, gr.31/2 or even 4.

Regards,
Willem Falhaber

Isn't Panalure the paper that was rumored to make gorgeous prints, but was 
being warehoused by savvy photogs since Kodak was about to discontinue it?

The other day I tried to scan some b and w negatives, and the results
weren't very good. I wonder if anybody else has tried to do this, and what
is the best way to do it. I was using a flat bed scanner at the university
that has a drawer for scanning negatives.  I followed the directions in the
manual, but when I printed the image out, it wasn't very good. Later I
heard that to get a good scan of a negative, you need a very high quality
scanner, and a flat bed scanner is really only good for scanning reflective
surfaces.

I hope this isn't too off-topic.

Shannon, several months ago I scanned a 35mm Tri-X neg of a 3-year-old 
self-portrait on a flatbed scanner at my local Kinko's.  I saved it as a 
JPEG, only using about 3/4 of the possible file size, afraid of taking up 
more than available on a floppy.  The quality was excellent.

I'm not sure what type of "drawer" you're speaking about, the machine I used 
had a device to place negs into to hold 'em in place on the scanner's glass.

If you're after better quality, perhaps you might visit a service bureau 
which has better or more gently-used equipment than at your school.  Bring 
them your digital file and hard copy output (if any) so they can see what 
you're dissatisfied with, and recommend/test scan an image for you.

I would suggest that you give ilford VC paper a try.  It all depends on the colors
in your original scene and what the print will be used for as results vary from
very good to unacceptable.  You can make somewhat nicer prints with panalure, but
it may not make any real difference to your needs.  It also depends on your light
source.  If you have a color enlarger you can use it with VC paper to adjust your
prints look as well. Panalure comes in three grades (or did).  Just my two cents
worth on this.

The results are far superior to what you will get with variable contrast
paper regardless of filter combinations.
  BTW, B&W camera filters can be used with this paper with the same effect
they have on the camera, useful for darkening skys, etc.
  I've used pan paper as a paper negative to make prints from color
transparencies. Maybe not ideal but works surprizingly well.

Interesting - I could do with something to stop me falling over things
generally. Do you think this safelight would keep me upright when climbing
walls, gates, steep hills etc. in the UK landscape?
It is years since I did any colour neg printing on monochrome paper - I
experimented when Kodak Ektar films came out with the then amazingly fine
grain at EI 25. I wondered if it was viable as a monochrome print negative
material. In the end it wasn't, but I did get some interesting results. The
grain was exceptionally fine, but the sharpness in monochrome was low and
the tones odd.
I have been trying to find an article I read not to long ago about using a
green or cyan filter to cancel out the orange mask with colour negatives
when enlarging on normal (non-panchromatic) VC monochrome paper, plus the
other VC filtration on top. Frustratingly, I couldn't. I seem to remember
that it did often work quite well with a bigger range of contrast available
than Panalure and the facility to use different contrast grades in the same
print. Exposure times were long but acceptable.
Not much help if I can't provide more accurate and fuller information, but
maybe enough to prompt an avenue of exploration in comparison to Panalure.

I would highly recommend getting a copy of a quite excellent book "Making
digital negatives for Contact Printing" by Dan Burkholder, published by
Bladed Iris Press. It contains a valuable CD too with curves for scanning
into Photoshop. Don't be put off by the 'Contact Printing' bit. It also
covers negatives for enlargement, and how to scan with flat beds or
otherwise. This is a vary complex subject and Dan Burkholder seems to have
reduced to simplicity with exact instructions on what numbers to enter into
what box in the scanning and output software. It isn't a geek's book
either - it is written for photographers, not computer experts. The author
also has a sense of humour. I am sure there are other similar books, but
this one looked like becoming a classic to me.
Anybody else read or used this publication? I was put onto it by Ray Spence
who is a great teacher and exponent of alternative printing processes in the
UK.

For 35mm. you can use a slide scanner.  Polaroid makes one, I'm sure other companies do as well.  It comes with a little plastic neg carrier and you can scan in to photoshop or whatever as b&w neg or pos (or color if you use pyro and like murky greens).  Some people, like biologists (like me), have access to slide scanners at work so ask around.  Some people like biologists; like me.

  That's Ektalure, a very warm tone paper. Evidently the environmental
regulations regarding cadmium affect warm tone paper. Both Kodak and Agfa
discontinued their long time warm tone papers at about the same time. 
  Panalure is an RC paper with panchromatic emulsion. The current product
is known as Panalure Select and is available in three contrast grades.
Unfortunately its available only in RC glossy finish. The Kodak data sheet
is G-27, downloadable from the Kodak site.

There is some interesting data on the http://www.bjphoto.co.uk site.if you
go to /ag-plus/Diginegs.shtml.
The article is by Tim Daly entitled Digital preparation of monochrome
negatives.
Sounds as though it would be useful to you without spending money.

Shannon,

I recently started scanning b & w negatives on my flatbed as opposed
to scanning prints.  My initial results were fairly poor as well.  After
quite a bit of testing using stepwedges and lots of scanning parameter
manipulation, I came to the conclusion that the default parameters for
negative scanning seemed more appropriate for color negs rather than
b & w.  I started using the positive scanning mode, read it into 
Photoshop and Inverted the results.  This immediately gave dramatically
better results.  You may have a similar situation and may benefit
from trying this.  I think scanning negs will in general need more
tweaking of results than scanning prints, but at least theoretically
you ought to be able to get better final results.

BTW, I'd also recommend Burkholder's book for the whole digital
process.

Roy

There is another panchromatic paper alternative - the paper that Kodak makes 
for its phototypesetting operations.  The paper is fully panchromatic, comes 
in long rolls, and is about the thickness of the old Thermofax copy paper - 
which is fine for paper negatives from color slides, but a bit inconvenient 
for regular enlargements.

The paper is probably not available through regular photo channels, but you 
can go to Kodak Polychrome's website, www.kpgraphics.com, for further 
information and dealer location.  One additional point.  The paper is SUPER 
fast.  I've had to use short exposures AND neutral density filters on the 
enlarger to make things work.

  Yes I have. I got EIs and curve shapes identical to Microphen, and the
overall look including sharpness and graininess is the same. The only
differences I've been able to find are that DD-X is awfully convenient to
use since it's a liquid concentrate and that development times for equal
CIs are longer.
  In short, no complaints about DD-X but imho not better than Microphen
either.
  Also it appears to be equal to Microphen for HP5+; I've used the 1:9
dilution as an equivalent to Microphen 1:1.

Barry,  I have Dan's first edition but have not really used it.  I
bought it some
time back thinking that I would make the plunge into the digital land of
enlarged negatives.  I have been able to avoid it for my platinum
printing negatives, but may use it on some new work to clean up some old
copies.

I have the good fortune of having Dan live close by and invited him to
go over some of his ideas with my students at a workshop last year.  His
new edition of digital negative making is much improved from his first
go round.  So Shannon,  I would recommend his book as well.  With all
the different  materials and output devices, you may have had an ok scan
and just
needed to manipulate the data to a new curve.  Good luck.

John,

Could you give an idea of the factor by which you should alter times when
changing dilution from 1:4 to 1:9? And are there benefits (besides economy)
of the increased dilution? 

I have an article from Photo Techniques Jan/Feb'00 where Phil Davies uses
1:6 for some emulsions in his assessment of DD-X (but not HP5+ or Delta
3200). He says that diluting 1:4 was too vigorous for easy control with
Delta 400 sheet film.

  Actually what happened was that I misread the data sheet and used the
time published for 1:9 at the 1:4 dilution; the result was a perfect EI
1600 push but that wasn't what I was looking for. Since I usually dilute
Microphen 1:1 for HP5+ I went ahead and diluted DD-X to the equivalent
strength and tried the same time, which turned out to be ok.
  Usually, when doubling dilution, about 1.5X the initial development time
is a good starting point.
  Increasing dilution gives a little better sharpness and can help prevent
getting development times that are too short for good control.
  Film and developer combinations vary in their response to increased
dilutions; some gain or lose speed when developed to the same CI and some
don't change.

Thanks for the help everybody. Let me take a moment and describe my
situation, so you have a better idea of what I need to do.

I am supposed to photograph a wedding in a few weeks. Although the details
haven't been totally worked out yet, they did mention that they wanted some
b&w photos. I'm thinking they will surely want the typical goup photos in
color, don't most people do?

Anyway, what I was thinking is to shoot everything with color film, and make
b&w prints from that. It was mentioned that Panalure is only available in
RC. Any idea on how that will survive display? Of course I would prefer FB,
but if they don't make it.. guess I'm stuck.

Does this sound like a plan? Or would I be better to carry two cameras and
shoot both color and b&w film?

thanks again
Dean

Dumb question department here.

I bought a tray siphon from Calumet.  It arrived without instructions and I
can't for the life of me figure out how it attaches to a tray.  I remember
seeing one a year ago or more but haven't seen one used since.

I've been looking for anything on-line, a picture or some indication.

Can someone give me a hint where this thingie hooks onto the tray?

  The MSDS for DD-X suggests its a liquid form of Microphen, probably
identical when diluted. Ilford now has MSDS linked to their site.
  BTW, Ilford's odorless stop bath is citric acid. It works with Ilford's
fixers because they have no hardener but should _not_ be used with any
_hardening_ fixer. Citric acid complexes aluminum interfering with the
hardening action. It may also cause eventual sludging of alum containing
fixers.

You should always shoot a wedding with two cameras just as simple 
insurance.
I shoot 12 or so weddings a year, mainly in black and white. I usually 
carry or wear 2-4 cameras.
Usually 2 with black and white and one color. This is what I think you 
should do but reverse the ratio.
2 color 1 black and white. Not only are you not relying on only one 
camera not to fail , you also are less likely to be loading film when 
something important is happening- instead of 36 shots you have 72 or 108 
available.
Black and white fiber prints always end up as the favorites of my clients 
( they rave about them and show them off to their friends) and have the 
added selling point of lasting 100 of so years longer, so the grandkids 
will see them.

Dean-- I shoot weddings almost exclusively in colour and if  bw prints
are wanted I  just have my local pro lab print them on "pearl" bw
paper.  Ithink it is a kodak RC paper but I'm not sure.  The results are
fine.   I always tell the couple that I can make bw prints from colour
negs but not the reverse.  It saves me from carrying two cameras or from
mixing up different camera backs in the heat of the action.    Barry

  Panalure makes excellent B&W from color negatives, however, it is no
different from other B&W resin coated paper as far as archival properties
are concerned. Toning will extend the life. Use Kodak Brown Toner, 1:25 for
a few minutes at room temperature.
  While modern RC paper contains scavengers and anti-oxidants to eliminate
the effects of the peroxides generated by the TiO2 in the reflective layer,
these chemicals have a limited capacity. Eventually RC paper will begin to
have problems with the mechanical integrity of the plastic layer under the
emulsion. No one knows the life expectancy of the paper. The exhaustion of
the scavenging agents is not predictable from normal accelerated aging
tests. It might happen in ten years or in ninety. The best estimate seems
to be around thirty years for dark storage.  Toning will protect the image
from oxidants but will not have any effect on the support. 
  UV light excerbates this effect so RC prints will have longer lives in
dark storage than when exposed to light. 
  For short term display prints Panalure is perfect except for the
super-glossy surface. 
  An alternative is to make duplicate negatives. This is a lot of work and
will result in a degradation of quality unless the master positive and dupe
negs are larger than the originals. 
  One possibility is to make dupe negatives by reversal processing of fine
grain negative film to save a generation. The resulting B&W negatives will
have a much longer life than the original color negatives.

  The syphon should have a spring loaded clip on it. It clips to the edge
of the tray. The exhaust hangs over the end of the tray so the end of the
tray must overhang a sink.
  The syphon will normally start by itself but sometimes they need priming.
Just cover the exit with your finger for a few seconds until water comes
out the other end. 
  Try syphons really work quite well but are best when not too many films
or prints are in the tray. When you have more than one you must pay
attention that they do not all bunch up or cover each other. I use a tray
syphon for RC paper, which I normally wash one at a time, and for sheet
film. A trick for sheet film is to clip a wooden clothes pin to one corner.
It keeps them floating and tends to keep them apart. 
  If the clip is broken off return the thing. 
 Another note: Old tray syphons can get a coating of calcium on them from
hard water. It can be removed by soaking the thing in any of the tile
cleaners on the market, or in a warm solution of Vinegar or 5% Acetic acid,
and table salt.

David,  It hooks on any side of a tray that has enough space underneath it so
that it does not prevent the siphon from sitting deep enough within the tray.
The spring should be held back while you slip the siphon down and onto the
tray.  Your water supply may be best secured with a clamp.  It can just be
slipped onto the tip of the siphon but you'd be asking for trouble.  Happy
washing.

Martin or Dean?,
it is of course your call.  If you feel that they are really interested in some
high quality B&W , shoot some B&W.  If the prints that they are going to want
from your negatives will be no bigger than 8x10 11x14 tops, B&W from color
negatives on to regular VC fiber paper will work quite well. It looks like you
have a few weeks to take a color negative and try a print or two. The fewer
colors that you have in the shoots the easier it will be to print.  You could
always make a positive from the color negative using a panchromatic B&W film and
then make a new B&W negative for printing by using an ortho film.  You could
then use any B&W paper.   Perhaps rental of a second camera body is a quick an
easy option if you are somewhat darkroom challenged or limited on time.  Wish
you the best.

  That's pretty much what the Ilford folks said. They indicate that it
contains a slightly different form of Phenidone that has improved
stability/shelf life, and that the tradeoff is that it costs more and has
longer development times.
  I recently used the last of a bottle of DD-X that I first opened a year
ago; I've stored it in the refrigerator, taking care that it stayed on a
shelf above 40F; although I didn't do any testing it appears to have worked
as well on the last film as on the first. No precitpitates etc.

  Interesting; I've been thinking about those two things....

  I thought about going to citric acid stop partly because or the ordinary
stop odor and partly because the local shop had some bottles of citric acid
on the shelf...which brings me to the point...
  During the summer months here in Florida I think I'm getting slightly
grainier negs; the only uncontrollable (without lots of gyrations) factor
is the wash water temperature, which can run up to 78-79F. I've been using
rapid fix w/o hardener, and I'm wondering about that.
  Do you think that wash, following the usual HCA rinse, could cause enough
emulsion swelling to cause or contribute to increased graininess? And would
a hardening fix help?
  The negs aren't tremendously grainier; it's more of a feeling that
summertime negs show more grain than wintertime negs...it's that vague.
  Thanks for any opinions.

The part of the siphon that is shaped like a "J" with the hole in it goes
inside the tray. There should be a spring clip on the back of this "J" that
holds the it to the tray. You need a deep tray to get it to work. The
regular run of the mill processing trays are too shallow.  If the clip is
not there, then there was a problem with the product and you should call
Calumet for a replacement.

It hooks onto the side of the tray and the height is set to give the depth
of water required in the tray.
The tray of course has to be raised up to allow this operation to take place
due to the size of the siphon.

When I did wedding photography and this situation arose I always printed
onto grade 3 paper for the B/W prints using the colour negatives.
Although a photographer would appreciate the difference the general public
is not aware of the difference-at least that was my experience.
Show them a B/W print from a colour negative before the wedding and gauge
their response.

Panalure makes excellent B&W from color negatives, however, it is no

It might be a good idea to finish in Agfa Systan as well.
But I still think FB prints are obligatory for clients when long life images
are important, as they certainly are with wedding pictures. If ever I need a
reminder of this I have some framed colour prints of my son, now 15, at the
age of 2 in my home and they are VERY badly faded. I also have a monochrome
print that I made of a much loved dog which died in 1997. The RC print on
Agfa Multicontrast RC was neither toned nor Systan-ed. Within 18 months,
framed on my office wall, serious bronzing was apparent. All the processing
chemicals had been ultra fresh and washing was more than adequate. There's a
lesson here.

Hi Martin,
I have photographed a lot of weddings and your quite right in supposing that 
many brides want B&W mixed with colour prints in the album. I would suggest 
that the best way is to use two film backs, one each for colour and B&W, 
making sure that you rate both types of film at the same ISO rating. When 
under pressure at a wedding it is very easy to make serious mistakes so risks 
should be eliminated before hand.
All the best,
Chris Morrison,(chris5by4@aol.com)

Reading all of these suggestions to shoot colour it seems a shame that
we aren't doing more to encourage/preserve an appreciation of
traditional black and white.  I think you need to establish exactly
what your client expects.  There seems to be a growing niche for PJ
style grainy wedding albums and if done well they are a damn site more
interesting to look at IMO, while the conventional posed album is
often forgotten at the back of a cupboard.

If you're feeling brave maybe you could lead them in that direction?
On the other hand shooting a wedding PJ style is probably more
difficult/stressful/demanding of the photographer, I hear there are
guys in the states charging huge fees for this kind of stuff.

Personally I wouldn't shoot the black and white on colour film but
then Ive never been paid to shoot a wedding, I just do it for fun and
if my prints don't work they have the boring posed group shots from
the hired guy with a Bronica to keep them happy.

Ideally you need an assistant to do the colour!

I am announcing a new website "A Wide Range Zone System" =
www.vsta.com/~alrob. This site presents a major modification of the =
Ansel Adams zone system, which makes it more flexible and powerful. It =
is also conceptually simpler.

To give you some idea of why you might want to check this out, suppose =
you are photographing a very contrasty subject, with a luminance range =
15 or more stops. My method gives you a process for placing any two =
luminances, anywhere in that range, on the print zones you desire. The =
method enables you to determine the development and exposure required to =
achieve these placements. In such a case, a low-contrast developer, such =
as POTA or Kodak Technidol would be required.

I would appreciate any comments on either the substance of the method, =
or on my presentation of it. Thank you in advance. This is not your =
father's zone system.

Call for articles:

Pyro, a new online journal, is looking for articles from practicing 
photographers.  The website is currently under construction, but needs some 
juicy articles for it's launch in the next month or so. The introduction 
page can be found at http://www.sae.bendigo.latrobe.edu.au/phototheory/

The journal is not currently refereed, but will be in the very near future - 
as soon as all that messy paperwork stuff is done!

Please reply to ljcarrington@students.latrobe.edu.au

OK.. so I'll end up with an upside down J with the tail hanging outside of
the tray?  I'll need a deep tray then, or I'll have to put the tray on a
stand of some sort..

thanks all.

took while at art school 25 years ago. I know I didn't do much other than
simple fix and short wash because I considered it disposable. No obvious
deterioration at all.

That isn't exactly correct as POTA an Technidol are not the only routes to
high contrast control. Other compensating can and may be used.

You may not want a deep tray if you want a rapid water exchange. Greater
volume of water, slower exchange. Time the exchange rate with food
coloring, aiming for about one complete change every five minutes.

I use a standard 16x20 tray - a Cesco-Lite, best darn trays ever made ;) -
with the siphon towards one end of a short side. The tray is in the sink,
propped up with egg-crate (the plastic stuff used over recessed fluorescent
lights). You may note the siphon's flow has a direction, and you may want
to adjust its position so the flow is aimed at the middle of the tray, not
at the side wall.

The funnel shaped push-on faucet attachment that comes with the siphon is
intended for a funnel shaped lab faucet, which you likely don't have. You
may want to cut the attachment off, adding whatever is appropriate for your
setup. In my case that's a female hose fitting with quick-connect.

you just out the tray on the side of sink, and  then the water will exhaust right
into the sink

   This is an interesting question. Ilford's processing technique is
predicated on the fact that the fibers in the support take up hypo in a way
that makes it much harder to wash out if allowed to soak for more than
about a minute. Longer fixing time allows the hypo to soak into the inner
structure of the paper where its held by a bindind force which requires
washing to be a sort of frictional effect. Hypo in the paper fibers does
not come out in a strictly diffusion process, as it does for the emulsion.
The use of a sulfite wash aid materially helps to break the bond and
substantantially shortens the wash time. However, if you can keep the hypo
from getting bound up in the paper fibers in the first place the washing
will be even more thorough. 
  I suspect the effect is not cumulative once the paper has been washed.
That is, if the paper is fixed in a short time and washed out, and must be
again fixed, if the second fixing time is short and the whole procedure is
followed, probably the fixer comes out as in the original washing. This is
speculation. Generally, in doing local reduction on paper the reducer is
confined to the emulsion until the process is finished when the whole sheet
is re-fixed. 
  Probably the only way to tell what is happening is to test for
thiosulfate residue. The simplest test is the silver nitrate test.
  Kodak HT-2
Water				750.0 ml
Acetic Acid, 28%		125.0 ml
Silver Nitrate		  7.5 grams

  Place a couple of drops of this on a clear area of a print or negative
and allow it to stand for two minutes. Wash off thoroughly. There should be
no stain or only a very slight stain. 
  Note that this stain is not removable so tests should be performed on
scraps or on areas of prints or negatives which do not show. 
  Kodak publishes a "Hypo Estimator" for comparison with the test stain. 
  Stains can be fixed by treating them in a 5% solution of Sodium Chloride
for a couple of minutes and washing. The stain will tend to continue to
darken with time if not fixed. When fixed the density of the stain can be
measured by using a Blue filter on a color densitometer.

  Its possible that Barry _overwashed_ his RC prints. It turns out that a
small residue of thiosulfate left in the emulsion acts to passivate the
image silver by patially sulfiding it  and provide a substantial amount of
protection against oxidation. Since RC washes out very rapidly it should
never be treated with a wash aid or washed longer than the recommended four
minutes. 
  If the prints are to be toned a wash aid bath may be necessary for the
toner to work well, but then the toner will provide the image protection. 
 Your photo finished snapshots were probably given a minimal wash when
processed. 
  The problem is that there is no quantitive test for the "right" amount of
residual hypo. 
  A more effective solution is to use a polysulfide toner like Kodak Brown
Toner to produce just enough sulfiding to protect the image. Brown toner
affects all sizes of silver particles uniformly so will provide protection
to all parts of the image with very slight toning. 
  Selenium tends to tone the denser parts of the image first, so slight
toning with Selenium may leave the highlights of a print unprotected. More
thorough toning with Selenium _will_ protect all parts of the image but
will cause substantial change in image color and density.
 RC has lifetime problems but they should be seen as happening in decades
not days or a couple of years.

  Neither of these are "compensating" developers in the sence of producing
a strong shoulder on the film curve. Both are Phenidone developers without
any other reducing agent. 
  Phenidone is a very low contrast developer. It is used in Technidol and
POTA for exactly this reason. When used in "normal" developers it is always
used with some other agent which is super additive with it allowing much
higher contrast. The other agent is usually Hydroquinone or Iso-ascorbic
acid. 
  Technidol contains a surfactant to control the uniformity of penetration
of the developer into the very thin emulsion of the film.
  While other developers can be used, dilute Rodinal and dilute Xtol among
them, both will have a tendency toward higher contrast than POTA or
Technidol. 
  The very thin emulsion of Technical Pan is the root of both its very high
resolution and also problems often encountered in processing it. Even
slight uneveness in agitation may cause major effects in uneven
development. Thus Kodak's cocktail-shaker agitation technique, meant to
change the developer at the surface of the film rapidly and thoroughly.

Hi,

I can also recommend Dan Burkholder's book. Its rather hard to find in
the UK - in the end I got it from Amazon in the states. Its written very
clearly, and even as a self-confessed photoshop geek I've learned a lot
of new tricks from it. There is a particularly good chapter on photoshop
for the monochrome worker. Highly recommended.

I have had good success with Barry Thornton's divided developer formula.  It
is ready and forgiving and produces a good negative with both T Max and
Delta films, as well as old Panatomic-X (rolled in 1978) and a hodgepodge of
unknown emulsions that my students and colleagues send my way...Typical
example "We found this roll of 620 in old Mr. Doe's camera.  Could you
develop it for us?"  Turned out a bit fogged but there were some usable negs
on this 40 year old film.

I am now looking for a *fast* B/W film that holds its speed in Thornton's
developer.  I shoot 35mm with old rangefinders, almost always with an 85mmF2
or 100mmF4 lens, always by available light, and usually of quick moving
teenagers or elementary school kids.  No tripod shots of scenic wonders. I
enlarge to about 8x10 max.  Nice smooth tones more important than lack of
grain.

Any suggestions?  If it just isn't going to happen with the divided
developer, I am open to any other recommended film/developer combinations.

Dan

I've tried this myself, some time back, using the same neg with both Cold 
Light & Condenser heads.  The condenser made the image look magical, while 
going up to grade 4 (Ilford Galerie) still didn't yield enough contrast for 
my finicky taste.

Steve,

  Its possible that Barry _overwashed_ his RC prints. It turns out that a
small residue of thiosulfate left in the emulsion acts to passivate the
image silver by patially sulfiding it  and provide a substantial amount of
protection against oxidation. Since RC washes out very rapidly it should
never be treated with a wash aid or washed longer than the recommended four
minutes.
  If the prints are to be toned a wash aid bath may be necessary for the
toner to work well, but then the toner will provide the image protection.
 Your photo finished snapshots were probably given a minimal wash when
processed.
  The problem is that there is no quantitive test for the "right" amount of
residual hypo.
  A more effective solution is to use a polysulfide toner like Kodak Brown
Toner to produce just enough sulfiding to protect the image. Brown toner
affects all sizes of silver particles uniformly so will provide protection
to all parts of the image with very slight toning.
  Selenium tends to tone the denser parts of the image first, so slight
toning with Selenium may leave the highlights of a print unprotected. More
thorough toning with Selenium _will_ protect all parts of the image but
will cause substantial change in image color and density.
 RC has lifetime problems but they should be seen as happening in decades
not days or a couple of years.

Richard
I normally tone all my prints using selenium wherever i can fully tone and
the colour change is not important. Otherwise I use gold or Agfa Viradon
(which I like a lot). Kodak's brown toner doesn't seem to be available in
the UK. I also finish with Systan afterwards.
In this particular case I hold the negative so archival processing was not
critical, and just wanted a print of the much loved pooch on my wall
quickly. I omitted the usual after-treatments and was shocked at how quickly
deterioration set in. Washing will not have exceeded 4 minutes. As the print
enters the wash, I switch on my Ilford rotary print drier which takes 2
minutes to warm up. This is my wash timer.

Barry T.

I have had good success with Barry Thornton's divided developer formula.  It
is ready and forgiving and produces a good negative with both T Max and
Delta films, as well as old Panatomic-X (rolled in 1978) and a hodgepodge of
unknown emulsions that my students and colleagues send my way...Typical
example "We found this roll of 620 in old Mr. Doe's camera.  Could you
develop it for us?"  Turned out a bit fogged but there were some usable negs
on this 40 year old film.

I am now looking for a *fast* B/W film that holds its speed in Thornton's
developer.  I shoot 35mm with old rangefinders, almost always with an 85mmF2
or 100mmF4 lens, always by available light, and usually of quick moving
teenagers or elementary school kids.  No tripod shots of scenic wonders. I
enlarge to about 8x10 max.  Nice smooth tones more important than lack of
grain.

Any suggestions?  If it just isn't going to happen with the divided
developer, I am open to any other recommended film/developer combinations.

Dan
You might try Diafine to get more speed from 400 speed films. I am working
on a maximum film speed divided developer, but don't want to go off at half
cock until I have fully tested it with all emulsions.
Look out for a new EI 400 speed film, due for release in early 2001, which I
have tested. It really is a giant leap forward, and is designed like T-Max
3200 and Delta 3200 as a dual speed emulsion where a second layer of
emulsion kicks in with extended development to give extra speed without
excessive contrast. Genuine 800 and 1600 speeds are readily achieved with
push processing. At 'normal' 400 speed its grain and sharpness matches
current EI 125 speed films in my opinion.
But you will have to wait for it!

  I can't understand why bleaching would mean multiple dips in fixer. Are
you mixing fix with the ferricyanide bleach to make it into a reducer? If
you are I would strongly suggest only bleaching, not reducing, until you are
happy with the result. That way, if you over bleach, you can always
partially develop back, even locally by wiping on developer with a sponge or
pad of tissue. The developed back area is often cooler in hue, and this can
be a useful way of subtly having cool highlights and warm shadows.
  The print will need to have been properly washed before bleaching,
otherwise unintended reduction will happen. Once bleaching is satisfactory a
quick refix can take place in film strength fixer. There is only a tiny
amount of silver to be fixed away, and 30 seconds fixing will be more than
enough to do the job. The fixing times are not cumulative. If the print has
already been washed, this second 30 second time will mean that, again, the
fixer by-products do not have time to penetrate and bind to the paper
fibres. The short wash regime can still be employed, especially if you use a
wash-aid. However, if you selenium tone subsequently, this does contain
ammonium thiosulphate, and a full water rinse/washaid/wash routine will need
to be followed.

Hi Al
I am still studying your site which looks very interesting, and well done
for sharing these ideas. Please don't think that I am being negative (pardon
the pun) when I point out that exposing the film to a card lit by artificial
lights immediately renders all following measurements and computations
wrong. Monochrome film is slower under tungsten light than day light.
Different films vary in their speed drop, but typically it is half a stop.
The card needs to be illuminated by even diffuse daylight I believe.
I will carry on studying the rest of the process you outline with interest
however.

conceptually simpler.

To give you some idea of why you might want to check this out, suppose you
are photographing a very contrasty subject, with a luminance range 15 or
more stops. My method gives you a process for placing any two luminances,
anywhere in that range, on the print zones you desire. The method enables
you to determine the development and exposure required to achieve these
placements. In such a case, a low-contrast developer, such as POTA or Kodak
Technidol would be required.

I would appreciate any comments on either the substance of the method, or on
my presentation of it. Thank you in advance. This is not your father's zone
system.

Barry,

not much testing is needed to establish that monochrome films can be 
more easily tested under  tungsten light than daylight.

I found that daylight was "never" quite constant during the time it 
took to expose a dozen negatives  when I wanted to make a series of 
zone system exposures to establish true film speed and to see what 
the curve looked like, so I settled for artificial light (light 
bulbs, not flash or fluorescent). The artificial light curves seem 
more reliable to me. Once in a while I do a few shots in natural 
light in addition to the artificial light  exposure series, just to 
see how densities compare, and they do differ a little bit, just like 
you say.

That the artificial and daylight speeds vary does not worry me. The 
main thing is that I do all the tests using the same light set up, so 
that all speed tests are comparable. I have  my own standard curves 
and speeds established for the two films/developers I use most and if 
I get these  speeds and curves, then the prints are going to be good. 
If the values I get are correct in absolute terms does not worry me, 
as long as I know how they relate to the standards that I know work 
for me. But I am an amateur....

Shannon -  That was a dumb move on their part.  If wired in that manner  how
do they shut the blower down for routine repairs??? Shut off the lights?

The used fixer should be out of the darkroom and in a closed storage/silver
recovery/disposal drum.

First, if the darkroom ventilation systems fall into the same catagory as
laboratory fume hoods, they need to be flow tested and certified on an
annual basis.  That means a flow test and appropriate posting of the results
and date.  For a quick go/no go test to see if the blowers are operating,
tape some strips of tissue paper or very light fabric on the air intake and
the vent duct.  If they just hang there - no flow!  They should be "flapping
in the breeze".  There are, also, some vane type flow indicators that are
available from laboratory and safety supply houses.

If the school officials do not provide a safe working environment, there may
be sufficient grounds to get OSHA involved. 

Good luck.

  Hi Al
  I am still studying your site which looks very interesting, and well =
done for sharing these ideas. Please don't think that I am being =
negative (pardon the pun) when I point out that exposing the film to a =
card lit by artificial lights immediately renders all following =
measurements and computations wrong. Monochrome film is slower under =
tungsten light than day light. Different films vary in their speed drop, =
but typically it is half a stop. The card needs to be illuminated by =
even diffuse daylight I believe.
  I will carry on studying the rest of the process you outline with =

My supplier was out of my usual toner today, so I picked up some Kodak
Brown Toner.  There was no info on the bottle about dilutions, but I
found a reference on their web site to 1 ounce to 1 quart of H2O.

I toned 4 prints with large white borders, 2 at a time, face to face.
The first two showed quite a bit of toning in the borders, but the
second two did not.  The prints were all developed at the same time.  I
really like the chocolate brown color.  It doesn't smell quite as bad as
Viradon, but it takes twice as long to tone.

Anyone have any tips,trick, or advice on this stuff?

  Kodak Brown Toner is a polysulfide toner. The publlished formula T-8 is
similar but the commercial product is much more concentrated. 
  Brown toner can be used at several concentrations. 1:25 is suitable for
toning for image protection. The toner is intended to be used at about
100F. It will tone at room temperature but will take perhaps half an hour
for full toning rather than a few minutes. The toned prints should be
"stopped" in a bath of Kodak Hypo Clearing Agent with vigorous agitation
before washing. The toner continues to work in the wash until it is washed
out. 
  Unlike most toners Polysulfide toners tone _faster_ as they are diluted
or exhausted. Very dilute toner will produce peach or yellow stains in the
highlights. Avoiding this is the reason for using the strong sulfite
stopping bath and rapid washing, at least at the beginning of the wash. 
  I am out of Brown Toner but thought there were instructions on the bottle. 
  I suggest toning prints one at a time, at least until you get a feel for
the suff.
  Slight toning provides full image protection since polysulfide toners do
not split tone, unlike diluted Rapid Selenium Toner. So even the highlights
will be protected against oxidation.

Thanks for all the info, Richard.  Do you know if Agfa's Viradon is pretty much
the same stuff?

You should be able to get good results from colour negs on ordinary *fixed
grade* b/w fibre paper which is not affected by the colours in the
negative. I've successfully used Agfa Record Rapid grade 3 (when it was
available) for this. Attempts with VC paper were disappointing. If you
don't want to shoot b/w film as well as colour that would be my suggestion.
Try a "rehearsal" first though.  For a wedding something like Kentmere Art
Classic would probably satisfy the happy couple.

I've used one of these for many years and found it to be effective.
However, be warned.  The tray needs to be placed so that an overflow caused
by the stopping of the syphoning action will not cause damage or upset
domestic harmony.  I have found when my wife turns on a cold tap  downstairs
the water pressure can drop sufficiently  to cause the syphoning action to
stop.  I now place the tray on an upturned plastic container in a bath so
any overflow is drained away and I can leave the darkroom with peace of
mind. John Jackson.

  Kodak Brown Toner is a polysulfide toner. Viradon and Kodak Poly Toner
are combination toners combining a polysulfide with Selenium toner.
  Lee, Drago, and Wood, of Kodak labs tested Poly Toner and found that it
protected images. I causes more change to the structure of the silver than
Selenium but that is significant only for microfilm or similar very high
resolution applications. I don't specifically know if combination toners
split tone. My guess is that they do not, at least as far is confering
image protection. When toning pretty nearly to completion any sulfiding
toner or selenium toner will protect the image and the choice must be made
on an esthetic basis. 
  There, one must experiment with the particular materials to see what
results. 
  In general, prints or films to be toned should be treated in a wash aid
bath. This is both to remove hypo and to adjust the pH of the emulsion to
nearly neutral.
  Brown toner and the combination toners are pretty alkaline and will swell
and soften the emulsion. Also, Brown toner is usually used at an elevated
temperature. For those reasons a hardening fixer should be used and a
hardening bath may be advisible subsequent to toning. 
  A sulfite bath, Kodak Hypo Clearing Agent will do, should be used after
both Brown Toner and either combination toner to stop the toning action and
prevent staining. Both Viradon and Poly Toner can can cause the same
staining problems Brown Toner can, its a property of the polysulfide. 
 Kodak now has their brochure on toning on line as a PDF. A search for
"Brown Toner" will find it. 
 The Kodak web site has a perfectly tremendous amount of good information
on it and they are adding all the time. Start by going to "Service and
Support" and from there to "Library".

I tried them first - at the time I asked they were out of stock and
cited problems with supply from the states.

I mentioned in my earlier post that 2 of the 4 prints I made showed some toning
in the white borders and the other 2 did not.  I just realized that those 2 had
been given a bath in Agfa Sistan prior to toning,  as I had not planned on
toning them.

Could you bathe simultaneously?

Not deep enough. But it's an effective way to wash the floor. Personal
experience....

Focus one one subject and shoot the hell out of it:

Here is what I would look for:

--The huge collection of 1950's U.S. cars in various forms of upkeep.  The
paint is fading, the cars are different
colors but very interesting since no other country is like that

--Old Havana has some wonderful, although decrepit buildings.  Get a nice
long lens if you can carry it and focus
on the corners, windows, peeling paint, the wonderful old architecture
before it all falls into the see.

Its a wonderful place.  Enjoy.

As my venerable Time-O-Lite starts acting up, (variable amount of flickering 
light levels, presumably from dirty contacts within what looks like a sealed 
mechanism), I'm looking for a new enlarger timer. (one with grounded outlets 
would be nice for a change!)  I've been trying to use the concept of f-stop 
printing, doing the calculations manually, but would like to hear if anyone has 
a recommendation for an enlarger timer that runs on this principle.  I've been 
looking at the website for RH design's Stop Clock.  Is anyone on the list using 
their timers?  Thanks in advance!

Greetings to the List,

This is my first post after a couple weeks of lurking. I'm very much a
beginner at printing and had a couple of questions about the different
papers that are out there. For the most part, I've been using Ilford
Multigrade IV RC Pearl. I find that exposure times with this paper rather
short which makes dodging and burning difficult. I read an article in Photo
Techniques that recommended using a dimmer and voltage regulator to dim the
light. That would lengthen exposure times for sure. Before I go out and
purchase such hardware, I'm wondering if there are different papers that
take more time to achieve the desired exposure. If there aren't any paper
options, are there other ways I can lengthen my exposure times besides
stopping the lens down? If it makes any difference, I have a Beseler 23C.

Thanks in advance,

Mark

Hi Arlo,

I don't have any neutral density filters. Do you know if I could find one I
could put in the filter drawer?

Do you remember where you got that white diffusion glass?

Thanks so much,

Do you have any neutral density filters for your camera?  You can put one under
your enlarger lens too.

Or,

I put a piece of white diffusion glass in the filter drawer on my Besseler.
Gives me longer printing times and softer light.

Yes....my Rodagon has filter threads, though I'm not sure if they are a
standard size.  It should be a simple matter to just attach an ND
filter....can keep it there permanently.

I don't know what you consider correct exposure length or what f-stop you are 
using, but I use the paper a lot.  I have the beleler 23C ll Dichro.  I 
adjust f-stops between 4 and 11 to make an exposure between 15 and 30 seconds 
for 8 X 10 and 11 X 14, that is exposure for each yellow and magenta filter.  
Total exposure may be anywhere from 30 seconds to one minute.

It may be your negatives are too thin and the problem may be in initial 
camera exposure &/or development.

Mine is held on by a rubber band.  Same for my home-made black net diffuser.
Nothing fancy here.

I found some sort of diffusion chamber at a camera show.  It is a Besseler
part, I think.  You pull out the cylinder that holds the condensers, and
replace it with another cylinder that has a piece of diffusion glass at both
ends.  Well, the printing times were too long with that setup, but 1 piece of
diffuser plus the condensers works pretty well.

But you should be able to find a piece at a glass shop.  Actually, it's
plexiglass or plastic.

There may be a lower wattage replacement bulb available also.  Anybody know?

  It would be helpful to know:
Type of lamphouse on the enlarger (dichroic, diffusion, condenser).
Size and type of lamp or lamps it uses.
What f/stop do you have to use for reasonable exposure time?

  For burning and dodging times of not less than around 30 seconds are
desirable. 
I think a dimmer is overkill. A regulator will not affect the output of the
lamp. 
  If you can use lower wattage lamps that would be the most satisfactory way.
  You can use neutral density gels of the sort sold for stage and motion
picture lighting. Calumet has them as do other large photo suppliers. They
are cheap. The gel should be used on the lamp side of the negative. 
  If you have a dichroic color head you can adjust the setings to get the
equivalent of a ND filter.

It's a condensor head with a GE 75W PH/111A 125V lamp. I use an El-Nikkor
50/2.8 at 5.6 - 11 on most of my negs and the range of exposure times is
between 10-20 seconds. Most of my negs look pretty good. Some are thin
(earlier ones) but with the films I've got dialed down, I get about 10-20
seconds. I would like a little more with some of the ones I want to dodge
and burn.

Any ideas which lamp would work better and where I could get one?

Thanks so much. I'll see about calling Calumet tommorow.

A dimmer may be overkill in this particular situation, but not in others.  For
Example; if you are using an old Elwood enlarger with no longer made 500 watt
enlarging bulbs a dimmer will effectively lower the voltage that the bulb sees
causing it to last a lot longer.

Kurt;

I was in exactly your situation a few years ago when I saw that one 
could get the Analyser (one step up from the Stop Clock) directly 
from RH Design not only at a price much lower that the retail price 
here, but also with a return guarantee: if you don't like it just 
return it. I never even thought of returning it after having tried it 
out. Try it out yourself! The people at RH are (zone system???) 
(amateurs/semi prof??) photographers which explains why their 
products are like they are. Like you will like them they are! But get 
the Analyser. One small step for the purse, but one giant step for 
convenicence. And you are still the boss. It is a real aid in the 
darkroom. You will love the densiometer function, it will really help 
you optimise your film speed and development time. One more thing: 
there is a new Analyser out now and they offer an upgrade of the old 
ones for, I think, about 30 pounds sterling. I wish camera 
manufacturers would do that!  Would have saved me thousands

 Kurt,
Don't hesitate over the RH Design f-stop timer, I bought one over a year ago 
and find it easy and logical to use, (and I am not very technically- minded.) 
I find that thinking in 1/4 stops more or less density ( or whatever 
increment you dial in ) makes decisions far easier when printing, as I guess 
you will have found out. The timer is well made, instructions very clear and 
RH most helpful with backup advice.
Saffron.   (No connection with RH etc etc!)

Christer,

I wouldn't say the Analyser is one step up from the
StopCLock, personally, as the StopClock has more advanced
timing functions than the Analyser. I dare say Richard can
explain more fully.
They are very nice products though. I use the StopClock and
the ZoneMaster*, and am very happy with them.

Regards,   John


* Like an Analyser but metering functions only.

You don't say what size enlargements you're making. Times can be quite
short with small prints. Anyway, 10-20 second exposure time is fine, 15-30
seconds would be better if you're slow at dodging. What dodging tools are
you using, can you describe your technique? Base exposure does not make
much difference for burning. If burn times are too short to control, for
the burn stop down (remember to open back up for the next print!) or add a
neutral density filter as others suggested. Are you using variable contrast
filters? You should be printing with a filter at all times. If not, using a
filter will increase your times.

>>For burning and dodging times of not less than around 30 seconds are
>>desirable.
>>I think a dimmer is overkill. A regulator will not affect the output of

I very respectfully disagree with Mr. Knoppow here. A matter of style, I
suppose, but 30 seconds is a long exposure for a standard black and white
enlargement. For beginners 15-30 seconds is long enough to dodge
effectively but not so long as to be boring. Many more advanced printers,
who can control the dodge, go for times of 5-10 seconds. My experience is
that a voltage regulator, supplying 110-115 Volts vs. household 120-125
Volts, usually will dim an incandescent bulb some.

>Any ideas which lamp would work better and where I could get one?

The expensive solution is to get a color head for the enlarger. That will
enable you to make "denser" negatives and the diffused light source is
usually slower than condenser/tungsten. And you'll have the convenience of
dial-in VC filtration. Condenser, being a "contrasty" light source requires
a "thinner" neg, hence often too-fast print times. Your best, least
expensive, solution for now is to learn to dodge faster, or add the
diffusion glass others suggested which in combination with the slightly
"denser" negs you will be able to make will increase your printing times.

  PLEASE set your e-mail programs to send plain text. I've been getting
messages from this list with giant colored letters, etc, completely
unnecessary.
  HTML at least doubles the size of a post, more likely tripples it, since
the message is sent once in text and again with formatting instructions,
which can contain lmore data than the text. 
  Postings to mailing lists should always be sent in plain text unless the
list specifically OK's formatted text.

Hi Les
Glad to see (hear? read?) you're back. Hope the US trip went well for you.
No doubt you had hundreds of emails waiting when you got back. When you have
a moment, could you perhaps look at my query among them for an explanation
of the self masking process you believe happens in the shadows when negs
with dense highlights are printed?
Thanks
Barry Thornton

Kurt,

I have used RH Designs f-stop timers for the past 5 years and would suggest
that you seriously consider the current Mark II version. In addition to
variable f-stop increments it has a dry down feature which takes the pain
out of worrying about prints drying darker than you want them.

I do admit to an involvement in that Richard Ross has become a friend  since
he introduced me to f-stop printing by asking me to review, for a British
magazine, the Mark I version of his timer several years ago. I have been
committed to f-stop printing since that time.

This is my first post after a couple weeks of lurking. I'm very much a
beginner at printing and had a couple of questions about the different
papers that are out there. For the most part, I've been using Ilford
Multigrade IV RC Pearl. I find that exposure times with this paper rather
short which makes dodging and burning difficult. I read an article in Photo
Techniques that recommended using a dimmer and voltage regulator to dim the
light. That would lengthen exposure times for sure. Before I go out and
purchase such hardware, I'm wondering if there are different papers that
take more time to achieve the desired exposure. If there aren't any paper
options, are there other ways I can lengthen my exposure times besides
stopping the lens down? If it makes any difference, I have a Beseler 23C.

Thanks in advance,

Mark

-Hi Mark
As I am sure everybody else will have commented, the easy way is to use ND
filters above or below the lens; or you can use the cyan channel of a colour
head if you use one as neutral density. Lowering current to the lamp may not
be such a good idea with VC paper since it will alter the colour of light
and maybe give odd effects in paper contrast.
For an interesting slower paper, you could try Fort Polywarmtone.

Brian: its Richard Warren from the puresilver list.  Sorry to take so long 
in returning your email.
>
OK:  I could not find the original invoice (was not in the original box 
witht the tubes) so I called Dennis at Darkroom Inovations (now called View 
Cammera .... (480) 767-7105))
>
I have two 8x10 tubes and 4 caps, as I mentioned they have never even had 
water in them.
The 8x10 tubes sell new for 69.00 and 35.00 per extra cap. I will estimate 
10.00 for shipping (they charged me 12.00 for NYC) This brings a total +/- 
209.00  (they are not cheap !)
>
I will sell these to you for 140.00 which includes shipping.
>
In estimating what to ask for these I had to weigh what I "think" they would 
bring on ebay.  Ebay has been getting top dollar prices on uncommon items 
(my experience anyway).  I also have to weigh the hassle it is to put up on 
ebay.
>
I can send these to you and you can write me a check when you receive them. 
My mail addy is:

Please excuse more off-topic traffic on this, but I would very much like to
second Richard's request to NOT use formatted text. The odd colors and
teeny-tiny print is difficult to read, and it does not quote correctly - if
at all - in replies. It would be a great service to all if those using
Outlook and Outlook Express set the program for plain text. Thanks!

I have been looking for a simple way to suppress HTML and MIME
attachments on pure-silver.  Unfortunately, it involves more hacking
of the 'sendmail' configuration on Unix than I really want to get
into.

I think I'll just write a program to do this (in my copious spare time ;)))
When implemented, email with HTML, XML, or attachments will simply
not appear with no comment back to the original poster.

Ian,

Try Fotospeed FD30 Push Process Developer with Neopan 1600. I have seen some portraits by Martin Collins using this combination and the results are excellent. I use it with Tri X and Ilford Delta 3200 and love the results.

I've been reading conversations about film/developer combinations with 
interest. I use 1600 Neopan as my fast film for wedding photography, 
developing in ID11. Has anybody got any tips/experience for different 
combinations ?

Kurt,

I have used RH Designs f-stop timers for the past 5 years and would suggest that you seriously consider the current Mark II version. In addition to variable f-stop increments it has a dry down feature which takes the pain out of worrying about prints drying darker than you want them. 

I do admit to an involvement in that Richard Ross has become a friend  since he introduced me to f-stop printing by asking me to review, for a British magazine, the Mark I version of his timer several years ago. I have been committed to f-stop printing since that time.

As my venerable Time-O-Lite starts acting up, (variable amount of flickering 
light levels, presumably from dirty contacts within what looks like a sealed 
mechanism), I'm looking for a new enlarger timer. (one with grounded outlets 
would be nice for a change!)  I've been trying to use the concept of f-stop 
printing, doing the calculations manually, but would like to hear if anyone has 
a recommendation for an enlarger timer that runs on this principle.  I've been 
looking at the website for RH design's Stop Clock.  Is anyone on the list using 
their timers?  Thanks in advance!

  Ilford Warmtone, RC and fiber, is about a stop or so slower than the
neutral papers. It won't go really brown unless you tone it, if you don't
want that.

Mark,  another thought for a slower paper is the Cachet VC papers, either RC or
FB.  It is about twice as slow as ilford.

Kurt, 
I have been using the RH Stop Clock since early this year. I would not like 
to be without it. Works well, lots of possibilities. The dry-down 
compensation is superb.
I used tables before or my calculator but this is much easier. 2 channels 
makes split filter printing (if wished) much easier. Foot switch and darkroom 
lamp switch are other bonuses.

Hope this helps,

Jan

While doing a series for a large portfolio and show I have been comparing
Cachet and Oriental.

With my 4X5 negatives printing 16X20 on an Omega D5, developing in Ilford
Bromphen my exposure times are normal at 28 seconds with Oriental and
exactly half, 14 seconds with Cachet.

The paper is not a brilliant white with the Cachet.

I hope this helps.

Steve ,  That would suggest that Oriental is 4 X slower than Ilford and I
haven't come any where close to observing that out come.  I have been using
Ansco 130 and Brom 3 from Maco. Interesting.  The cachet does brighten up quite
nicely with a selenium toning with the paper base moving much whiter.  If you
are looking for a whiter white, Sprints optical brightener can also be added to
the Cachet.

I read the first editon some time ago and the second edition about a
year ago as part of a course on digital printing at home given at the
International Center for Photography in NYC.  The second edition is
very good.  It's a big improvement over the first edition.  From the
perspective of a computer person he does some hand waving (although
much less than the first edition), but it is a good book.  My only
real gripe is that the book is very Photoshop-centric, but this can be
worked around.

I would also recommend a paper by David Fokos available at the Bostick
& Sullivan web site <URL:http://www.bostick-sullivan.com/>.  The paper
has a very good explaination of the (sometimes conflicting)
definitions of the various terms used by computer people and printers
(service bureaus).

Hi Tim:
Seems to me that I heard from a friend that he needed to get a permit to 
Photograph in Cuba (in the street).  You might want to check that out.  May 
just be a rumor.  I will ask my friend (via email) if I remember 
correctly.  He is going to Cuba in the Spring.

As usual,
Lee Carmichael

I would also note that your Humble And Obedient pure-silver hoster/moderator/lackey (me!)
loves Cuban Montecristo Double Coronas and Torpedos (ceegars) but would never ask you
to break US law by getting some to me ... Just have a puff for me ;)))

Why bother to go all the way to Cuba, when you could just go to Miami
instead?

But read the Diafine label about the effective speed of TMZ:  it's not 3200 
but perhaps 400, as I realized after seeing some VERY thin negs.

As I recall, your messages bounced because you did not send them from your
"home" email address.  pure-silver only allows you to post email from
the address with which you subscribed.  This is necessary to suppress
unwanted (spam) mail from outsiders.  Sorry.

Tim,  three weeks ago there was a large exhibition of Cuban photography at
the National Theatre on the South Bank.  You may have seen it and, of
course, it may now have finished.  But the organisers could well be able to
give you some contacts. Virtually all images were photojournalistic but made
by established Cuban photographers. Happy landings, John Jackson.

Oh yes, I do realise that Lee and I do appreciate your letting me know.
As you say, it might only be for Americans - but then how different does an
English Photographer look on the street to an American one? It is better to
be sure.
I will contact the embassy on monday.

I also read in the Lonely Planet Guide to Cuba that one couldn't take in
more than 4 films and that only col print film was available there.
The embassy scotched that one for me.
Thanks

Tim

get there and not be able to do what you need to do.  I always try to err

Far from becoming automated with the Analyser (MkI), taking up some time and
suitable notes, it really teaches you about your equipment and chosen
process.

Do not do what I did when I first got it, and zig the probe round the
baseboard like a F1 driver!

Richard Ross soon put my 'pilot error' in context - great fun and results
are getting there as well.

The trouble with TMZ is that it isn't 3200, it's actually 800 as the
instructions make clear. It has to be pushed to get to 3200 with ANY
developer. Similarly, Delta 3200 is 1000 until pushed.
I was specifically talking about 400 speed films.

At long last, the new DSL service is being installed here at the pure-silver
mansion.  I must thus switch over both the local machine configuration AND
the DNS configuration maintained in the internet root servers.  The latter
can take several days to propagate across the net.

This means that, over the next week to 10 days, you will probably experience an
inability to post and read things from pure-silver.  I'll let you all know
here when everything is stable again.

Richard,

    I have been doing my bleaching by cycling the print from the fix to a
quick rinse and then to the ferricyanide solution. Then cycling from bleach
to fix, interspersed a bit with running water on local areas I don't want
bleach running down onto. I end up putting the print in and out of bleach
and water and fix this way, sometimes quiet a lot. Then finally, after
bleaching is completed, into the fix again to fully fix the 60 second time.
I started timing some and came up with fix immersion of 2-5 minutes total
with images that take more bleaching in bits & pieces to get the small areas
right.

    That is why I asked the question.

    As for hypo clearing agents, sulfite & whatever. Nice way to go but
every time I do that I have to go back in and soak a bit in stop bath & then
rinse longer. Otherwise I get a whitish deposit all over the prints in a
major way as well as scrape marks from tongs, fingers and brushing. It comes
off after the soak in stop bath but adds extra time & a real 'pain in the
butt' aspect.

    We have very hard water here with chorine, iron, minerals and junk. So I
tryto do the final rinse or two in distilled water and soak for 5-10 minutes
each.

I just bought a Mamiya 7 II with the 65mm lens. It has
threads for a filter but it looks to me as though the
front lens element would contact the filter if I
screwed one on. The lens and camera manuals are mute
on this point. Anyone have any experience with this
lens and using filters?

I must confess that I am not a  photographer, it is my husband Scott
who usually lurks/ contributes. However he is at the moment in Namibia
(and uncontactable) and I have to get some colour reprints done from a
wedding earlier this year.
My problem is that the negs are quite contrasty ( it was a really
bright day) is there anything I can ask the lab to do to reduce the
contast- I can't afford to pay for each print to be hand printed.  The
lab is being v. unhelpful/ patronising- fully aware of my ignorance of
all things photographic.
Sorry to bother you with sometihng so trivial but I need some advice
as the people are chasing me for their prints!

Thank you

I had this problem with the 65mm and to a lesser extent
with the 43mm. There is a very easy method of determining
if a filter is safe or not. Here's what I do.

Take one or two small squares (say 3/4inch) of clean soft
toilet tissue and lay them on the front of the lens. Then very
carefully screw on the filter with the tissue trapped between
the filter and lens. As you screw on the filter you can see the
tissue being compressed. If the tissue fibres suddenly flatten
where the center of the lens is or if the filter becomes harder
to turn then STOP it's not safe. This is easier to do than
describe. The change in surface texture at the spot where
the tissue is compressed is very easy to see.
 
As an additional check after you have screwed the filter on,
tap the side of the lens barrel with the lens horizontal. The
tissue should move if it's not trapped too tightly.

I've found standard 58mm Hoya filters to be OK with this lens,
but the clearance is small. Hoya's HMC coating seems to be
difficult to clean. The best way I've found is to breath on it and
wipe with a piece of well washed chamois leather.

A tip about the Mamiya 7 II and it's battery. The metal battery
cap on the base of the camera is uninsulated. If you place the
camera on any conducting surface which can contact the cap
and any of the metal camera strap lugs then the battery will be
shorted out. I found this out the hard way. I now tape over the
battery cover.

Good luck with the new camera!

Bob Parsons

chiming in late here but if you are looking for a slow paper, and for
something different as well:

FomaTone MG, it is a multigrade paper (FB); matt surface, gives a very
nice special sepia like image, tones beautifull in selenium (all my own
personal opnions ofcourse).

It's speed compaired to Ilford MG FB (in PQ developer):

without filter 1 1/2 stop slower
with MG filter: 2- 2 1/2 stop slower

Best,

Cor

Hello Jeff,
    I have a Mamiya 7II with the 65 and 43 mm. Both have filters and I did
not observed any contact with the lens. I have B+W filters regular one for
the 65mm and a slim one for the 43mm. What brand of filter do you have?

    Daniel

Dang!  I, for one, am mighty impressed!  You not only talk the talk, but 
walk the walk, too, Tim!  May I call on you if I ever need a network put 
together in the future? ;)

Anyone know the life expectancy for powdered chemicals like D-76 and Dektol?
 These
 are unmixed but have been sitting in my garage for about a year.

thanks

Kurt, I have been using the RH Stop Clocks for some while now and even after 
30 years of printing by seconds I have become a convert!  So much so that I 
now have a bought another so both enlargers are timed this way.  It took me 
about a day to get used to it and, well I have never looked back; just seems 
more natural.

Cheers

Marten

I've always thought, perhaps incorrectly, that powdered chemicals in their
original container have an almost perpetual life unless they get rained on
or suffer some other such catastrophe.  I know I've used them many years
after their purchase without a problem.

pure-silver is free to you all, but for network engineering, I'm gonna
charge you a *lot* ;)))  It ain't as impressive as it sounds -
your average 12 year old manages to figure out a lot of this stuff
these days...

David,

I have had good luck printing T400CN on B&W paper. I've found that I need to print
this film using a higher contrast grade than I do with a conventional negaive...i.e
#3 or perhaps even #4 rather than #2 paper for a "normal" negative. This, to be
fair, is a controversial area. People who hate T400CN tend to REALLY dislike it.
Your mileage will no doubt vary.

Tim,

Unless you get a better offer, I will try to e-mail a copy of my C33 manual.
Please be patient, I have just got this scanner thingy this weekend. I love

Sue,

You should be able to take the negs and originals to a photolab and tell
them what you want. It will cost you a few bucks more for the extra
attention. Find a place that the pros in your town use and discuss it with
them. They will need to see the negs top be sure that they can do what you
want.  Good luck.

Richard,

    I have been doing my bleaching by cycling the print from the fix to a
quick rinse and then to the ferricyanide solution. Then cycling from bleach
to fix, interspersed a bit with running water on local areas I don't want
bleach running down onto. I end up putting the print in and out of bleach
and water and fix this way, sometimes quiet a lot. Then finally, after
bleaching is completed, into the fix again to fully fix the 60 second time.
I started timing some and came up with fix immersion of 2-5 minutes total
with images that take more bleaching in bits & pieces to get the small areas
right.

    That is why I asked the question.

Dan
I very strongly advise you not to bleach this way since you are reducing,
not bleaching. The fix left in the paper after the brief water rinse will
remove the bleached image meaning that you can't retrieve it if you bleach a
little too far. It seems to me that you are making a rod for your own back
by cycling from bleach to fixer.
The best technique is to fix properly by whatever method you choose (Ilford
rapid system or Kodak two bath system), then wash completely, ideally using
a hypo clear.
After this carry out your bleaching. If it is happening too quickly, dilute
the bleach until it works at a nicely controllable speed. You will need to
pull the print from the bleach just before the image, or section of the
image, is lightened enough for you - then plunge it in a water wash for a
few minutes to remove all the bleach. It will take a few seconds before the
bleach stops working in the water.
If the bleaching looks OK after this wash, refix briefly (30 seconds in the
Ilford system is more than enough), then go through the full wash routine
again. If the bleaching has gone a little too far, apply a little developer
with a pad of tissue, a brush, cotton wool etc. depending on area until the
image looks as you want it, then stop in a stop bath as normal, followed by
a brief refix and full wash.
You can selenium tone before or after bleaching, but you will need to ensure
you have refixed properly after bleaching if you tone afterwards - otherwise
yellow staining in the highlights is likely.

Hope this helps,
Barry Thornton

The British humorous magazine Punch in Victorian times printed a justly
famous sell-out issue with a front cover with the message "Advice for those
about to get married". The eager readers on turning to the inside page for
the anticipated racy story were faced with one word - "Don't".
That's pretty well my view about T400CN after printing quite a lot of it for
clients.

I have had numerous Sacks of Dektol go bad.  I used to buy it several bags 
at a time and no more.    If Kodak would package in cans like they used to 
years ago.  The stuff would still be good.  That said, I would mix the 
suspected stuff up and see what color it is.  If it is any color other than 
what you normally see, I would not trust it.  It will probably work and be 
just fine but I would not use it for any critical printing sessions.  I 
think what happens is that the bags develop holes in them or the sealing 
gives way somehow and air destroys the chemicals.

Hi,

It's the worst film I ever printed. Mushy grain, impossible to grade for
contrast, just awful.  I did actually process one roll in xtol and fixed in
C41 bleach, getting better results!! Best avoided IMHO ;~(

Cor,

Have you have any further information on this paper?
Sounds just what I'm looking for.

Worked great for me.  Need to used a #3 or #4 VC filter on most.  Very fine
grain and wide tonal range.

  It depends on the conditions of storage. Best is cool and dry. Kodak uses
paper bags with a coating inside which is supposed to be impermeable to
moisture and air; it isn't. Probably a couple of years is the typical
lifetime. 
  The best way to check is simply to open the bags. If the powder inside is
white its OK, if its brown toss it. 
  Back in the days when men were men and women wore bustles Kodak packaged
its chemicals in hermetically sealed cans. This stuff lasted for decades.

I think choosing a paper by printing speed is an odd way to go about 
getting a fine print.

In addition to the other recommendations regarding ND filters above the 
lens,
I would recommend considering a different length enlarging lens to get 
your enlarger's head further away from the baseboard- this will give you 
longer exposure times with any paper,so you have more choices, and you 
can probably use the prefererred 2 stops down lens opening (for sharpest 
images ) as well...

Just thought I'd ask.. is this the Chromogenic b&w film Kodak makes? I've
never used it so I"m not familar with it. How does it compare with Ilford's
XP-2? I have used that, but it's been several years ago.

The British humorous magazine Punch in Victorian times printed a justly
famous sell-out issue with a front cover with the message "Advice for those
about to get married". The eager readers on turning to the inside page for
the anticipated racy story were faced with one word - "Don't".
That's pretty well my view about T400CN after printing quite a lot of it for
clients.

If you get Eddie Ephraum's books, Gradient Light, for instance, he uses XP2
exclusively in that book and has wonderful things to say about it:  here's a
snip of his notes:  Ilford XP2:  Not technically BW film, but chromogenic BW
(must be developed in C-41!):     Ilford XP2 is said by Ephraums to be so
fine grained in the highlights that in monotone skies or other large
expanses of untextured lights the grain is not visually disturbing even in
11x14 enlargements.  He regularly rates it at 200.
     XP2 is a dye negative film, thus to overexpose creates less grain
because of the dye clouds.  At 200 or even 100 it is very fine grained.  Its
exposure latitude is extraordinary.  It holds very bright highlight and dark
shadow detail on the same frame, without changing development.  It is the
closest 35mm photographers can get to Zone System photography.  When you
overexpose a scene that has extreme brightness range, the highlights do not
go grainy.  And, fine grain negatives are easier to print, since the print
can be made darker, to look richer in quality, without it looking heavy and
having to use a harder grade.
     In camera this film needs more gentle filtration to avoid an over
exaggerated effect.  Red is rarely necessary.  Film is slightly magenta and
its density can, at first, seem a little hard to judge, being a dye rather
than silver image.  The color of the negative does not affect the contrast
of VC papers, by the way. p. 84 Ephraums, Gradient Light.
     Now, as far as labs go, they hate Ilford XP2 because it is very
difficult to color balance with color paper, and they end up with various
shades of monochrome from sepia to purple.  They love the 400CN which is way
easier to print on color paper.  As far as printing on BW paper, the Ilford
is made for that and the 400CN is not as good, also having the orange mask.
The nice thing about both is that that they behave like a typical color film
with overexposure, i.e. less grain, not more as in regular BW film.
     I personally do not use either (used both in the past, tho), finding no
reason to, but after seeing Ephraums work I have been rethinking my
position.
     BTW, in my beginning photography class, although warned repeatedly, two
of my students actually developed both of these films in BW chemistry (Xtol
1:1).  The Ilford fared surprisingly well, not real sharp and a bit low
contrast but not bad!  The Kodak was pretty dull.  But both got printable
negs even though the local lab said it wouldn't work.  I can't say they were
stellar so I don't recommend other than C-41!

  XP-2 prints like a conventional b&w film, with the apparent graininess of
an EI 100 film but a bit lower acutance.

  If you run your own C-41 you can experiment a bit; the old Ilford XP-1
kit was ordinary C-41 working at the equivalent of a 1:1 dilution with a
five-minute development time, and with XP-1 it gave somewhat better
acutance than standard C-41. Also if going for a higher EI the film can
benefit from pushing.

  T400CN, otoh, can be difficult. The orange mask acts like a
very-low-contrast filter when it's printed on a VC paper, and requires a
high grade or strong magenta filter just to get "normal" contrast...and the
couple of rolls I shot and printed still didn't look very sharp.

  I believe also these chromogenic materials are expected to have a much
shorter useful life than conventional films, although of course they aren't
subject to the color shifts that affect color films.

Yeah, if your Dektol turns brown as crystols it's oxydized and won't work.

Julian,

Take a look at

http://www.foma.cz/en/tech_listy/F_tone.htm

and

http://www.fotoimpex.de/  (in german)

it seems a realy nice paper, though I did not have the change to work a
lot with it, do try selenium toning. I will be testing its possibility
for lith printing in the future

Good luck,

Cor

Thanks

However, anyone who claims f-stop printing to be illogical either is
ignorant of, or has misunderstood, the basic mechanism of photographic
exposure which centres on something called a D/log.E curve. That is to say
density (whether on a negative or a print) is proportional to the logarithm
of exposure. It's the reason why camera shutter speeds and aperture
settings are designed the way they are. To adjust density in a consistent
fashion, exposure has to be adjusted logarithmically.

Suppose, Barry, you're out in the landscape in dull condtions with a slow
film, and you left your lightmeter at home (well, I've done it anyway!).
You reckon an exposure of 4 seconds to be about right but need to bracket.
Would you use a shutter speed sequence of say 2,4,8,16 seconds, or
2,4,6,8,10? I'm sure you appreciate that the latter sequence isn't going to
give you sensible results with film so why assume it does with paper? It's
the same stuff, only the base is different.

If you use f-stop methods you can put a scale on your enlarger column which
reads in f-stops instead of inches, so if you change print magnification
you simply read off the necessary exposure time adjustment without having
to worry about what the existing exposure time is. If you use a colour head
to print VC paper you can calibrate your filters in f-stops so when you
change contrast, you can easily and quickly change the exposure to suit the
new filter factor. If you make a test strip in quarter stops, you can close
the lens down two stops and increase the exposure time by two stops, make
another quarter stop test strip and get exactly the same result. If that's
illogical then I'm the Queen of Sheba.

Your method works for you and I have no problem with that, but I *do* have
a problem with your continued claims that yours is the 'proper' and
'logical' way. I make no such claims for the f-stop method, I only try to
explain why I think it offers many advantages and let people make up their
own minds. I have had more than enough telephone calls, letters and e-mails
from people who've never looked back since changing to f-stop printing to
be confident that those advantages are as clear to others as they are to
me. The important thing is we all have a choice; there is no absolute right
or wrong method of exposing paper and nobody should claim that theirs is
the only proper way.

Regards
Richard

Hey Richard - I was making fun! That is why the word 'proper' was in
inverted commas. I am really sorry if I have rubbed you up the wrong way -
that was the very last thing I wanted to do. I recommend your timers (and
the ZoneMaster and PaperFlasher) whichever method of timing is used, and I
use one daily that has been trouble free, which is more than I can say for
my Hauck programmable timers.
I was actually saying that your timers are not just for f stop system users.
I shouldn't have been so smart ass about it.

Hi Barry,

>inverted commas. I am really sorry if I have rubbed you up the wrong way

No problem, obviously your tongue was farther into your cheek than I
thought. It helps to use a smiley to avoid misunderstandings :-)

>I was actually saying that your timers are not just for f stop system users.

Indeed, there's no compulsion to use the f-stop mode but most of the clever
bits will only work in that mode for reasons I explained in my last
posting.  Perhaps to ensure the continuing health of this excellent forum
you and I should call a truce!

Regards
Richard

Dear Jonathan,

I used my L-30 coolscan/silverfast,  you get  nice curves if plotted with
excel. It gives you a nice idea about curves. of course the units are
different, but you can see if you have a straight line or not.

ciao

Andreas

Richard & Barry,

These are just the type of postings lurkers DO need to see on Pure-Silver...
heated they may become, but that's the nature of beast (I mean the
art/craft/science <s>)... at least we all may learn a little more of BOTH
ways of doing something. This particular argument/discussion is a damn sight
more interesting and relevant than the totally OT Cuba thread which should
have been removed from the list.

Cheers, and lots of love to both of you!

No truce necessary. He's 'partie prise' on your side. Meanwhile this thread
has convinced me to order one. I've always found that business of taking in
stops meanwhile this thread has convinced me to order one. I've always found
that business of taking in stops but printing in seconds (ie non log) a bit
weird..

Folks,

Get out a beer to cry in, or a cuppa if you're in the UK, and if you have a 
moment please let me have your suggestions on improving my record in buying 
a medium format camera.

Looked at a Mamiya RB Pro-S in very clean condition, but passed because of 
size/weight, the need to advance the film and cock the shutter 
independently (I tend to forget those details occasionally and so want 
simplicity), and the non-instant return mirror.  Oh, and a fat price.

Saw a Pentax 67 with a 55 mm WA lens (the old model) at B&H in NYC and put 
down the plastic.  On testing, found the roll length was permanently set to 
220 so I merrily took about 15 pictures on my first roll of 120 (well, 10 
1/2 landed on the film).   B&H was good enough to take it back.

 From a local pro, bought another Pentax 67, with the 150 mm/2.8, and was 
testing it when the shutter stuck open, mirror up (raised base density on 
that frame).  Finally closed when I took the battery out.  Again I was 
lucky and the seller took it back (bless him, if any one needs a pro in the 
Washington, DC area I'll happily pass his name along).

I've convinced myself that I'm a roll film person (40+ years of 35 mm 
cameras).  Though I own two very old view cameras, and took one of John 
Sexton's b/w workshops, I'm not ready for the sheet-film life, just the 
print quality big negatives give.  I went for the P67 twice because of the 
similarity to my Nikons.

My questions:
--are these experiences (2 for 2 bad) typical of early Pentax 67s?
--or are all used MF cameras in bad shape?
--How did you acquire a MF camera you are happy with?  which one?
--Is there a make/model/age of camera worth hunting for or avoiding?

We now return you to your beer in progress.

Thanks

Bill

Passing on 2nd hand info:
Saw a 16.20 b/w print (portrait), allegedly from 6x7 cm on CN.  To me, the 
skin tones were very smooth (mushy grain?), yet the detail of fabric and 
hair was quite sharp.

If you don't need interchangeable lenses,  you just can't beat an old
Rolleiflex.  I have several medium format systems of various sizes, but the
Rollei is always my first choice.  There is magic in those old boxes that
doesn't show up in tests and charts, but you can see it in your contact
sheets.  And they never lock up from bad batteries ;-)

You should easily be able to find a good user for under $400 (US).

  No to both, but remember that old-version Pentax 67 bodies are really
pretty old, many have had hard usage and the electronics may have endured
lots of moisture. More recent ones of the mirror-lockup variety should
generally be better. There are _plenty_ of them around, so there's no need
to buy a beat one.

>--Is there a make/model/age of camera worth hunting for or avoiding?

  If you liked the Pentax, it's sure worthwhile finding a good one. I'd
strongly suggest you avoid Kiev or former-east-zone anything.

Barry and Richard,

I found this discussion interesting. The subjects was relevant. 
There were no insults and no bad language (not that either would have 
upset me) . The health of the forum and its readers was never 
threatened. Pleace do not call truces, instead bring up more matters 
of this type for discussion. We all learn from you, both of you.

Thanks and regards,
Chris

Richard & Barry,

These are just the type of postings lurkers DO need to see on Pure-Silver...
heated they may become, but that's the nature of beast (I mean the
art/craft/science <s>)... at least we all may learn a little more of BOTH
ways of doing something. This particular argument/discussion is a damn sight
more interesting and relevant than the totally OT Cuba thread which should
have been removed from the list.

Cheers, and lots of love to both of you!

Agreed. I strongly dispute the logic of f stop printing. However, Richard
and I worked this thread to just about extinction a few months ago and it
seems pointless to start it all over again. My concern is that Richard may
have  felt that I am attacking him, and his products, personally - and I am
not. We need enthusiastic guys like him in this art/craft/science. In the
end, it matters not whether people produce fine silver-based images via
linear or f stop timing as long as they produce the prints.
If Richard were not there making timers, and other useful devices, it would
be a big loss to us all.
Anyway, it looks as though I am in a tiny minority, so Richard should worry!
My wife tells me that Victor Meldrew ( a curmudgeonly UK TV comedy character
for you non-Brits ) is styled on me. In which case I shall just have to use,
about f stop printing rationale, Victor's catch phrase  "I don't believe
it!" And my sand driven egg timer is fine for enlarger timing anyway.

Agreed. It's OK Barry, I didn't take it personally :-) But I will strongly

Quite so :-)

Hello. I'm new to the list and felt I should introduce myself.
I'm a college senior majoring in Biology and Writing. I have very little
photography experience so please forgive my naivete and silly questions. I'd
welcome advice/guidance of any sort. Right now, I'm just trying to
experiment with different equipment and techniques, which brings me to my
question:

Does anyone have any recommendations/advice about which liquid emulsions are
most effetive? I have ordered the book "Silver Gelatin" and hope to have
most of my questions answered by it, so I'll save other queries until later.
For now, I'm wondering which brand I should try first. From what I've
read/heard, people seem to find Silverprint easier to work with than Liquid
Light. The former also seems to yield bolder images. I thought I might try
the VC Silverprint emulsion.
What about Black Magic? Anybody have experience with it?

Thank you for your indulgence. =)

I've used a Petax 67 for about six years (purchased new). The weak link in
these cameras is the film advance/shutter cocking lever. Some times it just
gives uneven spacing between frames, other times the whole thing will lock
up. Sometimes, but not always, the uneven spacing is a precursor to the
whole thing locking up. Mine went bad twice in the first couple years with
light usage and great care in advancing the film but since it was fixed by
the Pentax factory the second time I've had no problems.

With that exception (which other, but by no means all, owners have
experienced) I really like the camera and would encourage you to persist but
with a newer, mirror lock up, 67 (as opposed to 6x7, which is the older
designation on the camera) . By medium format standards it's inexpensive,
the lenses are outstanding, and compared to other 6x7 cameras it's easy to
hand hold if you're so inclined.

In answer to Mark Dalal,

I am not familiar with your Beseler 23C, but assume the C means it has a
colour head. If this is the case you can introduce neutral density into the
light path by dialling in equal values of YMC filtration.  I have done test
with my Durst M605 and established that an equal value of 30 YMC = 1 stop
loss, 45 =1 1/2 stops, 50= 2 stops and 60= 2 1/2 stops. Your enlarger may need a
different reading, but my values should serve as a starting point.

I see this thread has resurrected the f stop printing controversy again. I
have used f stop printing since Gene Nocon popularised it with the
publication of his book in 1987, and the method has saved me countless hours
of work and wasted paper. I'm sure I could not work any other way now:
certainly would not want to.  However, there is no harm in constructive
points of view being expressed on the list. The only harm that I can foresee
in the sort of interjections made by Barry, is that it will lose him fans
:-)  Richard is right, f stop printing is so obviously logical, but
excellent though his products are, you do not need a "Stop Clock" to give
the method a try. I use the simple chart pinned to my darkroom wall, which I
posted on the list some time ago, and this has served me well.

Hope this helps,
Clifford.

This is not necessarily the correct answer.  A Beseler 23C may or may not 
have a color head.

Any chance of posting the chart again as I suspect it was before my time.
With all this talk of f-stop printing I should give it a try at least.

Subject: Exposure times when printing



In answer to Mark Dalal,

I am not familiar with your Beseler 23C, but assume the C means it has a
colour head. If this is the case you can introduce neutral density into the
light path by dialling in equal values of YMC filtration.  I have done test
with my Durst M605 and established that an equal value of 30 YMC = 1 stop
loss, 45 =1 1/2 stops, 50= 2 stops and 60= 2 1/2 stops. Your enlarger may need a
different reading, but my values should serve as a starting point.

I see this thread has resurrected the f stop printing controversy again. I
have used f stop printing since Gene Nocon popularised it with the
publication of his book in 1987, and the method has saved me countless hours
of work and wasted paper. I'm sure I could not work any other way now:
certainly would not want to.  However, there is no harm in constructive
points of view being expressed on the list. The only harm that I can foresee
in the sort of interjections made by Barry, is that it will lose him fans
:-)  Richard is right, f stop printing is so obviously logical, but
excellent though his products are, you do not need a "Stop Clock" to give
the method a try. I use the simple chart pinned to my darkroom wall, which I
posted on the list some time ago, and this has served me well.

Hope this helps,
Clifford.

Get out a beer to cry in, or a cuppa if you're in the UK, and if you have a
moment please let me have your suggestions on improving my record in buying
a medium format camera.

Looked at a Mamiya RB Pro-S in very clean condition, but passed because of
size/weight, the need to advance the film and cock the shutter
independently (I tend to forget those details occasionally and so want
simplicity), and the non-instant return mirror.  Oh, and a fat price.

Saw a Pentax 67 with a 55 mm WA lens (the old model) at B&H in NYC and put
down the plastic.  On testing, found the roll length was permanently set to
220 so I merrily took about 15 pictures on my first roll of 120 (well, 10
1/2 landed on the film).   B&H was good enough to take it back.

 From a local pro, bought another Pentax 67, with the 150 mm/2.8, and was
testing it when the shutter stuck open, mirror up (raised base density on
that frame).  Finally closed when I took the battery out.  Again I was
lucky and the seller took it back (bless him, if any one needs a pro in the
Washington, DC area I'll happily pass his name along).

I've convinced myself that I'm a roll film person (40+ years of 35 mm
cameras).  Though I own two very old view cameras, and took one of John
Sexton's b/w workshops, I'm not ready for the sheet-film life, just the
print quality big negatives give.  I went for the P67 twice because of the
similarity to my Nikons.

My questions:
--are these experiences (2 for 2 bad) typical of early Pentax 67s?
--or are all used MF cameras in bad shape?
--How did you acquire a MF camera you are happy with?  which one?
--Is there a make/model/age of camera worth hunting for or avoiding?


Bill
I too rejected the RB67 after owning and using one for the same reasons you
mention, plus frequently forgetting to revolve the back to the right
orientation. I described this in 'Elements'.
Your move to a Pentax 6x7 seems odd though. Not that there is anything wrong
with that camera - it's just a very different concept. Whereas the RB67 has
interchangeable backs and bellows close up focusing and is a tripod mount
camera, the Pentax is a 'big' 35mm SLR with fixed back and encourages hand
holding. If that is the route you want, no problem. I have not heard any
particular rumours of unreliability with the machine, though it would be
hard put to to match the tank-like construction of the RB. I have heard
favourable comments on its lenses though.
My own solution was the Rollei SL66. Totally mechanical and reasonably
priced second hand, it has:
 bellows close focusing
 reversible lenses for even better close up performance
 focal plane shutter up to 1/1000 sec.
 ability to mount all sorts of lenses via lens mount blank plates
 interchangeable backs that all take 120 or 220 film and don't cost a
fortune
 nicely damped instant return mirror
 beautiful Zeiss lenses at very reasonable prices
 lens tilt
 mirror up
 simple and quick multiple exposure
 nice range of heads including a really useful 45 prism that revolves, and
enables the lens tilt to act as swing
 a square format that means turning the camera or revolving backs are not
needed
and many other nice touches that show the camera was designed by
photographers, not marketing people or accountants.
My two SL66s have been trouble free for 10 years with one exception. That is
the proclivity of the backs to gradually drift out on frame spacing over the
years. they are quickly and economically adjusted by Rollei technicians, but
after a long period need the adjustment again.
Later SL66s have metering built in, but I find it quicker with a tripod
mounted camera to use a spot meter. The camera is a little bigger than a
'blad, but is still perfectly hand-holdable - a nice ERC with strap
encourages this. Try it with T-Max/Delta 3200 for medium format fun.

Thanks for the comments, Barry, and to all of you who responded.  Food for 
thought.

Just to clarify, I haven't moved from an RB67 to a Pentax 6x7 because I 
never actually owned the RB67--just fondled it a lot in the store.

Your description of the Rollei SL66 is the best info I have on that 
model.  I've not seen one in a store nor pictured on a web site.  The big 
roundup site for MF doesn't spend a lot of electrons on it either.  I'll 
keep looking.

Thanks all,

Bill

IS there anyone here who knows whether Aristo has a UK representative? I've
tried the BJP big book and Aristo themselves but with no luck.  Failing
that, is there anyone here in the UK using an Aristo 4500 VC cold light head?

The reason I ask is that we've developed a compensating version of the
StopClock Professional which senses the light output from the head and
adjusts the exposure time automatically to compensate for any variations.
So far it's available for the Zone VI VC head, but we'd like to offer it
for Aristo users as well. To do this, we need to get access to one for
testing.

Any help or information would be much appreciated!

Thanks in advance

Sticks and stones may break my bones ...

It's a war of words Barry!  Seriously though, Ed and Chris are right - this
sort of discussion is useful for everyone, ourselves included. If nothing
else, it makes *me* think and sometimes that can be useful :-) One day
Barry might even try switching his StopClock to its natural operating mode ;-)

Now, how many people here use "factorial" print development methods?  That
is, keeping the total development time a constant multiple odf the time
taken for the image to first appear. For example, if it takes 20 seconds
for the first signs of an image and you're using a factor of 5, develop the
print for 5x20 secs. The idea is that as the developer exhausts, you're
keeping actual development constant. So when it starts to take 30 seconds
for the image to appear, development time is 5x30 seconds and so on.

Regards
Richard

   I use Amidol for print developer { Michael Smith's formula - Amidol
8g.--So. Sulfite 30g. --pot. bromide 2cc  10% solution -- citric acid 3g.
and water for one liter --- for 1 min @68degF. } and have found contrary to
popular belief that it just doesn't wear out in less than 100 8x10 inch
prints/liter or at least two days.......I use the factorial method to check
on the emergence time and quit when it is longer than 30 seconds.
 Had always heard that all Amidol formulas were bad to oxidize but this one
just doesn't. I use the emergence time of the first prints which is usually
about 10 to 15 sec as a guide and only give 4 to 5 times total. This gives a
slight bit of room to go slightly longer for contrast increase.

I have tended to put a "standard"(the same) light saturated piece of 
paper in the developer and see how long it takes to start showing.  I 
then take that time and compare it with the time I recorded for fresh 
developer.  I assume a linear relationship and the new time is 
adjusted by:

Time adjusted = Time wanted * (Time depleted / Time fresh)

(I don't push this correction very far before I mix new which leads to 
my questions below)

I like your technique as you wouldn't have to work it backward if you 
wish to save the time for printing the same print later.

I would be interested in:  

1) is the curve usably linear for the relationship of time vs developer 
depletion to the point of question 2.  

2) The point where the developer is about to go beyond good 
performance characteristic and how do people measure for this 
point?  What ball park time increment factor from fresh should be 
used?       

Thanks
Stephen

Thanks for the comments, Barry, and to all of you who responded.  Food for

Just to clarify, I haven't moved from an RB67 to a Pentax 6x7 because I
never actually owned the RB67--just fondled it a lot in the store.

Your description of the Rollei SL66 is the best info I have on that
model.  I've not seen one in a store nor pictured on a web site.  The big
roundup site for MF doesn't spend a lot of electrons on it either.  I'll
keep looking.

Bill,
The SL66 is something of a rare beast now, though the latest version is
still available new at horrendous cost (7500 for the body only
approximately) on special order from Rollei I understand.
However, they are around second hand if you know where to look. There's lots
of good information on this web site:
http://www.photo.net/bboard/q-and-a-one-category.tcl?topic=Medium%20Format%2
0Digest&category=Rollei&topic=Medium%20Format%20Digest&category=Rollei
Well worth a look for all Rollei models.

Bill,

I'm coming in a bit late here, but having recently been retired but
unwilling to take to the rocker, I'm now doing free-lance work with 4 x 5,
a new RB67 proSD and (still) my old Pentax Spotmatic.

In 30+ years I invested in 3 Hasselblad systems...yes, they are great, but
I was now spending "my own" money. I looked at Hasselblad one more time,
quickly looked at Rollei, tried out both Pentax 6x7 and RB. The RB is
heavier and awkward to hand hold. The Pentax does not have the
middle-of-the-roll, change to different film capabilities. After an
"analysis" of a LOT of photographs I found that a very small percentage
were "square".

Since a most of the work I do is biological close-up, non square, both
colour and B/W with the camera on a support device, I finally went with the
RB. I can get closer with a variety of lenses, I can get an accurate
measurement of lens extension for correct exposure, with less wastage of
film. I can rotate the back as required and change film type in mid-roll.

If I need a square image I can crop a 6 x 7 "negative" down to that format.
If I need a rectangular image, I have to crop less from the 6 x 7 neg/pos
than I would have to with the 6 x 6.

I went with "new" rather than used, since I am a considerable distance from
any repair centre... as yet, I have to say that I am not disappointed with
my decision making process and brand "choice"

Bill,

I'm coming in a bit late here, but having recently been forcibly "retired"
but as yet unwilling to take to the rocking chair.  I'm now doing
free-lance work with 4 x 5, a Mamiya RB67 (proSD) and (still) my old Pentax
Spotmatic. My decision making process was as follows:

In 30+ working years I invested in 3 Hasselblad systems...yes, they are
great, but I was now spending "my own" money. I looked at Hasselblad one
more time, quickly looked at Rollei. A "pro" friend let me try out his
Pentax 6x7 just before he traded it in on the new 67 model.... the 67
proved to be more comfortable in the hand.  I then tried out both the
Mamiya 7, RZ and RB. They are obviously heavier and more awkward to hand
hold than either the Hasselblad or the Pentax.  Being a bit of a luddite I
hate being dependant on battery power and decided against the RZ.  The
Mamiya 7 is rangefinder... that was thus "out" for most of what I do, and,
neither the Pentax or the Mamiya 7 have the middle-of-the-roll,
change-to-different-film capabilities.

After an "analysis" how I want to "work", what my clients "need", along
with, and of, a LOT of past photographs, I found that a very small
percentage were published or printed "square" and turned my back on the
Hasselblad to get the slightly  bigger image area from which to work.

Since a most of the work I do is biological much of it close-up, non
square, both colour and B/W with the camera on a support device, I finally
went with the tried and true mechanical RB. I can get closer with a variety
of lenses, I can get a faster and more accurate measurement of lens
extension for correct exposure, with less bracketing and wastage of film. I
can rotate the back as required and change film type in mid-roll.

If I need a square image I can crop a 6 x 7 image down to that format. If I
need a rectangular image, I have to crop less from the 6 x 7 neg/pos than I
would have to with the 6 x 6.

I went with "new" rather than used, since I am a considerable distance from
any "official" repair or "loaner"centre.  If you are able to make a
purchase of used (some prefer the expression "experienced" equipment) from
a reputable dealer it might be worth the effort to take a second look all
your choices.... based on your needs.  As yet, I have to say that I am not
disappointed with my decision making process and final brand "choice".  I
recently find that some of my clients are willing to have pro scans made
from my 6 x 7 film to then be recorded to 35 mm for projection purposes.

   The 1930 edition of L.E.Clerc's book gives a little information on using
Watkins factors for paper developement. He quotes Glover but does not give
an actual citation. The factors for bromide paper in this book are:
Metol-Hydroquinone	X 5
Amidol			X 10

  For most modern papers and, say, Dektol, this comes out to reasonable
numbers.
  However, papers are developed to "completion", that is to the point where
the Dmax is reached. Published curves show that there is little contrast
variation possible through variation of development time, provided
development is carried out long enough for Dmax to be reached. Generaly,
the more bromide there is in the emulsion the less the possible variation.
  Chloride papers evidently did have some range of contrast control, but
probably not more than half a grade. AFAIK there are no pure chloride
emulsions on the market now, nor have there been for some time. Chloride
was used for very slow contact printing paper. Kodak Azo, the last contact
paper being made is evidently (from Kodak statements) a chloro-bromide type. 
  If the Watkins factor is used only to indicate how long a paper must be
developed to reach Dmax it is probably useful, although its going to vary
with different developers and probably different papers. 
  The system was widely used for film development in the distant past.
Since it requires instpection of the film at the very start of development,
before the film is desensitized by the developer, it would be nearly
impossible to apply it to modern panchromatic films without a fogging
hazard or the use of a pre-development desensitizer.
  I think it is more of historical than practical value.

I'm not sure what your formulas are based upon when you offer the comparison
of 10 times for Amidol, for example.

I get image at 15 seconds and use the emersion factor of 5 because my images
reach completion in 1min 15 secs.  If I pass the 1 min 45 second mark, I get
fog; so instead of 2 min development I develop to satisfaction in 1 min 45
or a factor of 7 at most.

Am I to follow this formula to suppose my developer may well be diluted,
more to reach completion in 2 min; or use less light, or make thicker
negatives?  On what is the 10 times based; and the consideration of the
emersion factor changing as the developer weakens, that's an understanding I
wish to know more about.

I suspect that Richard is correct with this factorial development.  This 
seems like a non-issue with modern papers.  If you make massive amounts of 
the same print it seems to me to be marginally useful.  I hardly print more 
than 5 images alike before moving along to the next image.  That neg will 
likely have a different exposure time and maybe different filter times but 
I will retain the 2 minutes development thru-out the entire printing 
session.  This seems perfectly normal to me to use this method.  Anything 
more seems just like trying to be technical for the sake of being technical.

Plan on a Utah photo trip in August 2002. Brigham City Museum Gallery will
host a photographic show, Faces of Utah: The B&W Landscape.
It features the images of Dick Arentz, Paula Chamlee Tillman Crane, Chip
Hooper, Craig Law, Ray McSavaney, Barry Parsons, John Sexton, Dan Smith and
Michael A. Smith.
This a show you don't want to miss and a perfect time to visit Utah on your
vacation. Brigham City is in Northern Utah, about an hour North of Salt Lake
City, home of the Bear River
Migratory Bird Refuge and on the way to Yellowstone National Park.
If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me for information as
I am the curator of the show.

Dan Smith

Thanks to everyone for your advice on the life expectancy of powdered chemicals.  Last night, after way too much turkey, I mixed some dektol in anticipation of printing some of the pictures I took yesterday tonite.  The first bag of powder was dark brown.  The second was white as sand on a Caribbean beach.  Oddly enough, the print on second bag was faded and the first bag looked as if it was purchased a week ago.

Given the low cost of chemicals relative to the other factors making 
up the total cost of a finished print, I find it quite surprising 
that anybody comes even close to using chemicals to the extent that 
they approach exhaustion. That seems to me to be penny wise and pound 
foolish. And I do not count my own time ;-)

I too have been using Michael's formula and as you say, it just doesn't seem
to ever become exhausted (within reason). I first used the Photographer's
Formulary kit and it did in fact become exhausted after about two hours, a
major deterrent to using Amidol since mixing it is a pain and the Amidol is
expensive. Michael's formula is a vast improvement.

Sorry about that - I didn't realise I should have kept it off list.
I have noticed though that even if I go to 'reply' as opposed to 'reply all'
it still comes up on the list and there isn't always another address given

The way round that is to cut the original poster's e-mail address from the
"From:" field in the message header and paste it into the "To:" field of
your reply.  Hitting "Reply" normally inserts the contents of the
"Reply-to:" field which in the case of messages from P-S is "Reply-To:
pure-silver@tundraware.com". P-S messages always contain the original
poster's "From:" field.

Dunno how easy or difficult that is to do in MS-Outlook Express, but it's
easy enough in Eudora.

Cheers
Richard

I understand that Kodak 28% acetic acid can be used as a paper stop
bath.  At what dilution would use it?

To make (approximately) 28% acetic acid, mix 3 parts Glacial Acetic
Acid with 8 parts water - *carefully* with eye protection, good
ventilation, and being careful to not inhale the fumes of the
Glacial or dilute acetic acid directly - they are pretty potent.


6oz 28% Acetic Acid per gallon of water is a pretty standard paper
stop dilution.  Note that this should *not* be used as a film stop
bath - film stop should either be much more dilute or (as I do) just use
running water.  Moving film from an alkaline ph developer to an acidic
stop bath can cause pinholing in the negatives which print as very
nice black spots on the final print which are a real pain to fix...

Thanks Tim, but I still a little confused.

The bottle of chemical I have reads "Kodak 28% acetic acid, cat 146
2829",  is this not already 28% acetic acid? Or does this mean you are
to mix it to obtain 28% acetic acid?  Also, is not acetic acid an
ingredient of indicator stop bath which is meant for film and paper?

Sorry, I was not clearer.  What you have is already 28% Acetic
Acid ready to be added to water to make a working stop bath. (6 oz/gal water)

The 3/7 forumula I gave you applies only to 'full strength' or what
is known as 'Glacial' Acetic Acid.

Yes, acetic acid is indeed a component of the Kodak Indicator Stop Bath,
which (in theory) can be mixed for both film and paper stop.  My suggestion
for using running water rather than an acid based film stop comes from
common practice among, especially, sheet film photographers.  It avoids
the pinholing problem I mentioned, which frankly, was probably more of
a problem with older films years ago, than today.  Nonetheless, I avoid
any acid stop bath for film just to be on the safe side.  Also, I develop
film almost exclusively in PMK Pyro, and as I recall, Gordon Hutchings
cautions agains using acidic stop AND fixers when pyro-developing film.

A while back, Howard Effner, one of our fellow pure-silver folk and an
industrial research chemist, did a little arithmetic concerning the
amount of acid you actually need to neutralize a developed piece of film/
paper.  As I recall, he concluded (Howard, jump right in and correct me here)
that even if you want to make a gallon of working stop bath last for, say,
100 8x10 equivlaents, most recommendations for acetic acid dilution were
way too strong and unnecessary...

28% acetic is that strength as you buy it--way too strong for any stop 
bath  ;-)
A cap full in a tray was the old rule of thumb;  good for a few hours 
printing at least.

  Dilute 28% Acetic acid 30 to 50 ml per liter of water for either film or
paper (1 to 1-1/2 ounces of concentrate to one quart of water) or 1 parts
concentrate to 31 parts water. The dilution is not critical. 

  _Kodak Indicator Stop Bath_ is more concentrated than 28%, it should be
diluted 1/2 ounce to one quart of water (15 ml/liter)for either film or
paper, or one part concentrate to 63 parts water.  The indicator dye does
not stain. 
  _Kodak Ektaflo Stop Bath_ is 28% and should be diluted 1 part concentrate
to 31 parts water.
 
  I think the other responses were giving you the method of diluting pure
("Glacial") acetic acid to 28%. This is done to make it easier to measure
out the concentrate for making up working solutions. 
  To make 28% from glacial acid combine 3 parts acid with 8 parts water.
This is then used as a stock for making working stop bath. Glacial Acetic
is very cheap.

  You can test non-indicator stop bath by feeling it. Good stop bath feels
"sticky", when it begins to loose strength the sticky feeling goes away.
This feeling is typical of acid solutions. Alkaline solutions generally
feel slipery.

Where is all the information on making the B&W fine art contact print?
I've read many years of magazines, hundreds of books, and I see contact
prints mentioned but not really discussed.  Surely there are a few tips
or hints applicable.  Is it really all that intuitive, I just do it like
I've always done it under the enlarger except without the enlarger and
it just happens beautifully?  For background, I'm comfortably competent
w/ my 4x5 view camera and the Zone system, have my own darkroom, have
mounted a one-man show.  Not an expert, but not a beginner either.

My 8x10 rebuild is nearing completion.  At 62 I don't have time to learn
it all the hard way, much as I'd like to.  I'd rather shorten the
learning process w/ a bit of research.  We're in pretty heavy company
here, some of you have no doubt written articles/books on the subject.
How do I find them?  Would gladly buy back issues w/ useful
information.  Would appreciate book recommendations.

Needless to say, I'm going to start anyway.  The wasted boxes of film
and paper don't concern me as much as the lost time making images that
could have been better if I'd had a clue as to where I was headed before
I pushed the button.  Do you have a helpful piece of advice?  (Yes, I'd
love to see two factions fighting over which method is the logical
method.)

Regards,   Dick Gifford

You might go to the web page of Michael Smith and Paula Chamlee. There
you'll find articles on contact printing with Azo paper, developing in
Amidol, and other hints on contact printing. I believe the URL is
michaelandpaula@aol.com . If this doesn't work let me know and I'll look it
up.

Use 1 and 1/2 ounces per qurt of water.  It's most important function is
to protect your fixer against developer contamination and itspremature

Well you learn something new every day....  I guess I have just been 
playing on the cusp where print density reaches Dmax. Therefore 
compensating my development time became more critical than it 
need be.  Thank you Richard.  Just shows that I shouldn't 
extrapolate all the characteristics of film to paper and vise versa.  
Should read or experiment more. 

So if I am now correct, the strategy that many out there use is to 
always process longer than Dmax.  The time they use is set beyond 
the Dmax of their potentially depleted developer and/or subjectively 
modified upward to maintain a time beyond Dmax.  Eventually they 
feel the developer is toast and discard it.   

Or (in addition and out of curiosity) does the developer give pretty 
consistent results until it is well into depletion where  the rate of 
decline greatly increases and the developer is obviously ready for 
the bin?  (not my subjective observation, but what the hey, maybe 
my developer has been deteriorating more between darkroom 
sessions than I thought)

Stephen

PS To all contributing list members, thanks for your help and 
information I have been back in the dark room for only a couple of 
years after a 30 year break.  I wonder how I produced anything 
much in my teen years given how little I really understood then.  
Perhaps it is a good thing that all I kept is a few negatives.

   I'm not sure which Richard is being replyed to :-)

  As developer is used the developing time to reach Dmax becomes longer.
Eventually, the Dmax of fresh developer can no longer be reached regardless
of how long development is allowed to continue. 
  In fact, the true maximum density of the emulsion is _never_ reached in
practical printing. Paper has a curve like film. At the hight density end
is a shoulder, effectively, a falling off of contrast, so that exposure for
increasing black must becomes nearly expoenential at some point. 
  This is of no practical importance in printing. The Dmax obtained from a
normal negative is dark enough so that the true Dmax would be
indistinguishable from it under normal viewing conditions. You can
demonstrate this by looking at a print with lots of shadow detail by
transmitted light, there is usualy some detail visible where the image just
looks black by reflected light. 
  Paper is developed to "completion" unlike film. The print is developed
until the Dmax is reached. Contrast changes very little after the image
appears but the shadow density continues to increase until most of the
silver is developed. 
  Development time is not critical as long as it is long enough to reach
completion but not long enough to produce highlight fogging. Fogging starts
after five to ten minutes for most developer-paper combinations. 
  If you are making a lot of prints its a good idea to print a sample when
the developer is fresh and keep it around for white light comparision as
work continues. It probably should be kept wet to avoid the difference in
appearance as the paper dries. checking a print against this periodically
will tell you if the developer has gone past its useful life.
  When it does, replace it completely, don't just put some fresh stock in.
The stock will replace the developing agents and accellerator but will not
undo the bromide leached into the developer. 
  Kodak gives capacities for its paper developers, but they are approximate
since the capacity is affected by the nature of the print. A low key print
with lots of dark areas will deplete the developer faster than a high key
one, there is more halide to be converted to silver. 
 Conversely, high-key prints will wear out the fixing bath faster than
low-key prints because there is more undeveloped halide. 
  Richard Henry made some tests of Dektol and other developers, publishing
the results in his book _Controls in Black-and-White Photography_, second
edition.  He found that there is little difference in brands of developer,
that 1:2 is the greatest dilution Dektol should be used at (he used 1:1)
and that there was little or no difference in the Dmax produced by various
packaged print developers. 
  This is a valuable book, now out of print. If you can find a copy, or get
one from your library, its worth studying.
  I think the main way of avoiding variation of results when processing a
large batch of prints is simply to use a large volume of developer, and,
perhaps to dilute it less than usual practice.

Gadzooks Tim, now you are asking me to reactivate all of those nurons which
are recovering from a turkey overdose!  Happy Holidays all.  

1.  I think that the earlier discussion had to do with how much acid was
needed for a one shot stop bath for PMK pyro.  At that time, I think that
some rough calculations showed that about 1mL of 28% acetic acid in 1000cc
of water was enough to neutralize the sodium metaborate in residual working
strength PMK (some volume of developer drag was assumed).  This was a one
shot stop.  For film, I usually use water as a stop before fixing.  Works
fine for PMK or HC-110.  Does not drop the pH, but gets rid of excess
developer that would be carried over into the fixer.  The residual developer
in the emulsion will either exhaust itself or be neutralized by the acidity
of the fixer.

2.  For prints, something that contains 0.5 to 1% acetic acid would have a
good working capacity.  This is what you get with 1 to 1.5 oz of 28% acetic
acid in a quart of water.  The actual working capacity is dependent on a lot
of factors - single or DW paper, fiber or RC, type of developer, drain time
before stop bath, etc.  With the older carbonate based paper developers
(D-72 as an example), more acid was required to neutralize the accelerator.
The neutralization chemistry also generated carbon dioxide which could cause
pinholes.  I do remember using D-72 on double weight paper and hearing a
high pitched squeal after the print went into the stop bath (carbon dioxide
gas escaping from the paper base).  For prints, the excess acid is needed to
give a useful working capacity.  Then again, acetic acid is dirt cheap, so
if the stop bath is questionable or has seen a bunch of prints, mix a fresh
one!  As Richard mentioned in another post, a good stop bath has a "stickey"
feel.  As the acid is exhausted, it will become "slippery".  Some time take
a print from the developer using your hands (notice the slippery or greasy
feel due to the alkaline developer) and how it changes when placed in the
stop bath and looses the slippery feel - then go back to using your trusty
print tongs.

Best Regards,
     Howard F. Efner

not wanting to sound grumpy, although my day did just go south, this 
thread, IMHO, is pretty needless.  If your prints are getting a bit 
flat and/or taking a bit too long than the first ones of the batch, 
replace it.  unless you plan to go so far above the manufacturers 
recommended capacity, whats with all the fuss.  On my worst day, 
going thru perhaps 200 sheets of 8x10 fiber (for work prints) i might 
change the developer 2/3 of the way thru.   why...mosty because of 
volume loss not for any other reason.  When printing finals and 
working very fast (remember i do this for a living) i still have 
found no situation where i would have to go to the lengths explained 
in this thread.

just my 2 cents

Fair comment :-) The reason I was interested to see whether the factorial
method was commonly used or not (I don't often use it myself) was because
in January (with average luck) we'll be launching a new process timer which
includes factorial development in its feature list. You tell it the factor
you want to use (which it stores), press the button and when the image
starts to appear, press the button again. The timer then calculates the
required development time.  You don't have to use the feature of course! 

It will also have an optional percentage display which will allow you

I agree completely. This "system" was explained in detail in Ansel Adams'
book "The Print." All I could think when reading it was that materials must
have been a lot different in his day because I've never encountered a
situation where I thought it was necessary to worry about this.  I suspect
that, at least with today's materials, it's a classic case of a solution in
search of  a problem.

<P>I believe that it is intuitiive and you should have no problem getting started.&nbsp; I started shooting and contact printing 8x10 two years ago and it is not really much different from enlarger printing.&nbsp; You can dodge and burn the image just as you would with an enlarged neg. Except this time you are simply dodging and burning &quot;light&quot; not a projected image.</P>
<P>&gt;</P>
<P>I use Oriental Segul VC.&nbsp; I put the paper in the easel; lay the neg on top (I don't even use glass- but I do not reccommend this). I do a test strip with a yellow vc (#0,1 or 2) filter and another with a magenta filter (#4,5).&nbsp; Then I expose the paper as the tests indicate.</P>
<P>You can use Azo but you dont't have to.&nbsp; I know this is all basic stuff but I hope it encourages you to get started.</P>

Agreed Brian, but there is one possible application. When working in a cold
darkroom or
one where the temperature fluctuates, Richard's gadget for factorial
development would then be useful. You would of course also have to use a
temperature tolerant developer such as Acuprint of FX12 print developer, and
wear a woolly hat! :-)

Forgive my off-topic posting here, but I know there's some overlap 'twixt and 'tween the two lists.

The Oly List, hosted by Zuiko at Shawnigan Lake School, is temporarily off-line, while Zuiko gets its guts yanked out and partially replaced (possibly including a software upgrade or switch from majordomo to something else).  For those of you craving a List fix (like me), it'll be a little while longer, I'm afraid.

Thanks for your patience and (to those pure-silver List members who aren't on the Oly List) your indulgence.

Rob,

Have you considered Phil Davis' BTZS tubes as an alternative to Jobo?
Agitation is manual "rotary" in a water bath at temperature.

Most of the development times can be done in the light (subdued is what 
they say).  The problem with the expert drums from JOBO is that they must 
be filled with the drum rotating.  That is how they work while in the 
JOBO.  I have heard of people using some sort of funnel to get the 
chemistry into the drum.  I personally have never seen it done.  That seems 
to be the major hang up when using the expert drums.  I have no experience 
with the JOBO tanks that use the reels.

Actually the BTZS tubes are very simple. Fill the caps with 2 ounces of
developer, insert the film in the tube, screw the tube onto the cap, and
start developing.  The entire develop, stop, fix process is all done in
daylight. The only step that requires darkness is when you're putting the
film in the tube and screwing the tube onto the cap.  I don't know what in
the instructions made it seem complicated but believe me, after you do it
once you can do it in your sleep. The fact that it's almost all in daylight
is also nice.

I would suggest to have a look at the Combiplan from HP. I know there was 
some heated discussion about it on some newsgroups, but if you follow the 
instructions that come with it, it's prety efficient. And it's the only 
daylight tank allowing agitation by inversion. But it only takes 6 sheets...

Hi,

I use the Jobo expert drums, and love them. I don't have a Jobo Processor,
instead I use a bi-directional Beseler base, which works well. I pour
chemistry in using a bent funnel (meant for cars) and have no problems with
the development - unbelievably even. I use two 3010 drums, which hold 10
sheets ion five holes. It is easy and fast to load. I couldn't see hand
processing them, but I do suppose you could roll it from hand to hand, but
that would be boring.

If there's anything I haven't answered, just ask,

e.

Hi Eric,

I use the Jobo 3010 on a processor, but I would suggest something 
different. If this is your first foray into 4x5 processing, and you dont 
want to sink too much cash into it, a much better alternative I think are 
the processing tubes from Darkroom Innovations. They require little 
expertise, are cheap and very versatile.

Factorial development is indispensible for any work which requires fine 
control and reproducibility. All developers are temperature sensitive,
and 
most oxidize fairly rapidly when diluted. Also, diluted developers have 
very little excess capacity, they absorb carbon dioxide decreasing pH and

activity, and they also accumulate bromide. As that happens, development 
rates decrease, and low value separation is compromised. The usual 
solution is to add some 10% carbonate which increases the pH, speeds the 
rate of development, and restores low value separation with MQ and PQ 
developers. Sometimes the addition of a restrainer is required if the 
paper is prone to fogging. When one replenishes the developer during a 
session the easiest way to control development is the factorial approach.

For many years I've used a DOS darkroom process timer program running on
a 
PC to facilitate factorial timing. It has gone through dozens of
revisions,
with different displays. For a factorial step, one simply hits the
spacebar,
during development, and the the timing interval is recalculated on the
fly 
using the factor. Warning tones, etc., are also recalculated. 

It's free, and has been offered in the rec.photo.darkroom newsgroup to 
anyone with an interest. If anyone wants it, contact me off-list, and
I'll 
send it by email (uuencoded zip file). 

A few people have requested a more sophisticated version, with a process 
database, personal film and print database, zone system film timer (N+/N-

times in one interval), film development temperature correction, print 
timer capability with magnification and reciprocity correction, etc. 
Although some versions have had most of those features, the interface is
a 
little rough and error trapping non-existent. Rather than doing it in DOS

for XT compatibility, I'm rewriting it for Windows, and will very likely
post it on the web.

I think the Jobo tanks would not do well hand processed. If you want to go
Jobo, though, the CPP-2 with lift is the minimal processor that will do.
Use it with the Expert drums. I have had students and friends who have
fairly successfuly, with fairly consistent results, used a Jobo drum on a
Bessler motor base, and for single sheet processing a Unicolor or other
paper drum either on a motor base or hand rolled. I believe Jobo strongly
recommends against this, but check their web site for more info:
http://www.jobo-usa.com/.

The suggestion of others to use BTZS tubes is a good one, although I
personally dislike the things, but know many who use them with highly
consistent and high quality results. You can make your own from PVC pipe.
Maybe someone else on the list can give you instructions, or ask on
rec.photo.darkroom or r.p.equipment.large-format.

How non-dedicated is your darkroom? I've set up trays to process in a
_tiny_ bathroom and have had students and friends do the same. Tray
processing is the least expensive way to go, very easy to run 8-10 sheets
at a time once you get the hang of it. Plus, it's the real deal. All you
need is a platform to hold the trays (they don't have to be all in a
straight line), which can be a sheet of plywood over the bathtub, or large
wall-mounted/supported shelf which can even be removable if you want.

No no no; use the method I've already described on the list of putting
fiberglass screening, cut 4x5", sandwiched in between two 4x5 negs, emulsion
side out.  Thus up to 12 sheets can be processed at once.  It's a snap,
really, once you've gone to the hardware store and ordered a piece of
screening and cut it to size.  Infinitely reusable, of course.  If I can do
it, mechanically challenged as I am, anyone can.

The "grumpy" and bored folks will have blown this away already so I 
won't be bothering them ;-)

Richard Knoppow, thank you for your patience and supplying me 
with answers to my question(s).  I now have a far better handle on 
the situation. 

My interest in this topic is partly my inexperience, but partly the real 
desire to be able to get a close to identical print at a later date.  I 
think all folks who process for short periods and reuse their 
developer at a later time have the same problem.  We have to be 
able to have a way of assessing the print developer, and I personally 
think it would be extreemly wasteful to start fresh every time I want to 
work in the darkroom.  As it turns out it seems that I do not need as 
much control as I thought I did ,some was imagined and some was 
just working at times on a steeper part of the curve (not yet to 
completion) than I should have been. 

Whether the problem is real or imagined, I and I am sure others 
now have a better feel for this part of the process.
 
Thanks
Stephen 

PS: I remember reading here or somewhere else a bit written by 
someone who worked for Ansel A.  Apperently Ansel gave this 
person trouble for not pulling the print soon enough.  This implies 
that Ansel did not always print to completion and this in turn would 
neccessitate the "factorial method" of developer control. ;-)

Chris,
I read and thought about your original posting. But I'm not convinced it 
would work for me, as the developer would probably be exhausted quite 
rapidly. I expose my HP5 at 200, and process in X-Tol 1:4. At this 
dilution, I really think 12 sheets would be too much for 1L or so of X-Tol 
diluted 1:4.

Yeah, at 1:4, with the 36 oz tank I think the combiplan is, you'd only have
enough developer for 160 sq. in of film or 8 sheets total.

Lou,

I have tried various methods of sheet film processing (4x5, 5x7 and 8x10)
and prefer the simple tray... or dish as some call it. Apart from being the
cheapest option - and it can also be used in any dark area not plugged into
an electricy supply (boot or trunk of car even <g>) - it is the most
relaxing way to process film. You are in the dark, with your own thoughts...
just the gentle lapping of the liquids and soft tick perhaps of the timer...
reliving the moment you made the exposure... and silently urging exposure
and processing to marry up to make that delicate, thin piece of film holding
the negative image into something that will translate into the
representation or impression of your budding, or bursting, creativity. There
is a parallel if you equate this with the constant rage between wet and
digital... tray processing is truly "hands on" whereas rotary processing, in
any form, is "automated".

Lotus view camera maker, Burkhard Kiegeland, routinely processes 20x12s (and
larger) in trays of Amidol... SIX sheets at a time. It takes practice, but
then that's one of the beauties of working methodically in the dark.

BTW: Many folks do prefer the Jobo method... but I can't bear to listen to
the "whirr, grirr, whirr, grirr..." cacophony for minutes on end, and I
certainly won't play loud music to drown the noise... in the dark, silence
is golden.

Just some comments on the factorial dev. method. I have noticed that the 
time when first black appeared in the developer is different if you are
printing on soft or hard papers or if you are using with VC papers let say
filter 4 or 0(the shape of the curve is different). So in a printing session
how do you use the same factor when you have different negatives? Personally
I never used the factorial method and I do not see any advantage except if
you are doing series of prints for commercial(and that is not my case). But
I would say in that case you are not trying to get the "best pictures".Any
comments?

Well said! I cannot understand why so many are so resistant to tray
processing. It is so easy, so straightforward, so natural, and so darn
inexpensive. I think many are not taught how properly, even though there
are several procedures, all of which have their proponents, and all of
which work quite well. Perhaps the resistance to tray processing comes from
our conditioning that what isn't expensive and mechanized and
(over-)complicated is no good? On a personal note, my start in large format
was too many years ago when I borrowed a friend's 4x5 for a commercial job,
and discovered an overwhelmingly strong sense of "this is where I was meant
to be" on processing the two negatives one at a time by hand in trays in
the absolute dark and quiet. I have been fortunate to have had the extreme
pleasure of students reporting the same near-mystical experience after
teaching them tray processing.

That said, I confess I use a Jobo because of a skin condition and
production demands. I tried tray processing with gloves, but losing contact
with the film is worse than using the Jobo with all its whirrs and creaks
and groans. And then there is the maintenance on the machine - never had to
lube or repair a tray! A dangerous thing to say, but I have not seen any
advantage to BTZS tubes, Combi tanks, etc. over trays. Seems to me these
other methods just involve more expense and more fiddling with gear with no
gain in quality, quantity, or sense of craftsmanship. But to each his own.

After hearing all the mourning for APX 25 last month I ordered a brick from Calumet.  I finally got around to shooting a roll this week.  I'm looking at the contact sheet right now and all I can say is 'wow!'

Aside from ordering another brick, I'm going to give Kodak Tech Pan a try.  I'm curious what other slow emulsions ya'll are using out there and how they measure up.

John,

3:1 for Rodinal seems to be very concentrated. Is that dilution ratio
correct?

Thanks,

  TP is a very different animal; it has a rather short range before
blocking, rapid humidity changes cause flatness problems, and it can
reticulate pretty easily. These specs work for me:

  Rodinal 1:100 5'/72F EI 12-16
  Ethol TEC 1:15 5'/72F EI 50

  After the developer, use either a couple of water rinses or a
half-strength stop bath.

Let's give Ed a round of applause. It isn't easy to wax lyrical over tray
development but he's done it, and very nicely too.  Maybe I'll now enjoy it
more as I hover over the trays of smelly chemicals, frantically trying to
keep track of which negative is on top, which is on bottom, and how much
time each one gets.

I am making my first venture into 4x5 sheet film and was wondering if anyone has any experience of using Jobo Drum tanks for hand processing 4x5 sheet films. Are they suitable for hand processing and what are the merits of each model? Are they easy to load?. Does inverting the tank cause the film to be pushed out of the rails? 
The two tanks I am considering are the 3010 which seems very expensive or the 2561. I was also quoted a another Jobo product id of 5110 but I cannot find any reference to that one.
I do not have a dedicated darkroom at the moment so a daylight processing tank would suit me better than tray processing.

Thanks in advance for any advice / comments.

Ken,
You jogged my memory. I have just reread that section of BTZS.
There seems to be an awful lot of light switching, cap filling, tube spinning, tray tempering and anti-halation removing not to mention the need for a good deal of manual dexterity in the dark. The method seems to make what is essentially a simple process very complicated. A single dev tank which will take 6, 10 or 12 or more 4x5 sheets would be more appealing and less time consuming.

Rob,

A long standing photojournalist friend of mine, Denis Thorpe of the UKs
"Guardian", once related how he had to fight his way amongst other snappers
into the only free lavatory on a moving Royal Train (in somewhere like
Africa if I remember), black out the window with a dustbin liner, see-saw
his 35mm film in the wash hand basin using small amounts of pre-mixed dev
and fix kept in bottles in his pockets, wash the film with a couple of
flushes in the WC(!)... and then hang the film out of the window of the
speeding train to dry. The film would be picked up by a courier at the next
station, whisked to the nearest wire machine possibly hundreds of miles
away, hopefully to appear in the next day's paper. Denis said that readers
occasionally complained about the quality of some of his pictures appearing
in newspapers in those days... but he admitted to having difficulty keeping
dust and scratches off the negatives when they were travelling through the
bush at 60mph to dry! 

Needless to say, all this was in the pre-digital era... when press
photography was a real skill (and fun by the sound of it). Not a car boot
anecdote... but something similar  8-0

As I said in an earlier post I need to use this method for some guidance as
to when to throw out my developer.{ 2 gallon trays for large 40 inch prints
using Amidol aren't cheap!}
I would like some help here as my photo-chemistry  is sorely lacking in this
area. I use the Amidol for print developer { Michael Smith's formula -
Amidol
8g.--So. Sulfite 30g. --pot. bromide 2cc  10% solution -- citric acid 3g.
and water for one liter --- Develop for 1 min @68degF. }
And find extreme long lasting results. In fact I had a batch mixed in a tray
when the original thread on this subject started and just returned home
after three days to find the developer still strong and working well -
uncovered in a tray all this time.
 What is so different about the M. Smith Amidol developer that it can last
so long as opposed to the regular Amidol formulas that go bad in just a few
hours at best? .......all I can find vastly different is the amount of 10%
solution of pot.bromide. Any thoughts at the photo-chemically challenged
level :o) would be appreciated!
Thanks,
Chuck

I plan to use the tray for 8x10 and larger.  Any advice on barrier creams?  I
read about Kerodex 71 somewhere, but don't recall any tech info.  Anybody have
good experience w/ products like this?  Will they affect the dev action or spot
the film?  Does Rodinal need such a barrier, or is it harmless?

That's the "secret" as you put it; the amount of POT bromide determines the
dichroic (spelling is my problem) fog.  This also determines the
'sculptural' qualities of your print.  It seems to determine the
preservation properties, too.

Hi Chuck - In his paper discussing Azo and Amidol, Michael says "the major
difference between this formula and others is the extremely small amount of
Potassium Bromide used. That's the secret. The Citric Acid acts as a buffer
and extends the life of the developer. . . . A tray of developer can be used
for an entire printing session with no reduction of its developing
strength." That being the case (and my own experience with this formula
bears out Michael's statement, as yours seems to also), why are you
concerned with factorial development? Brian

I've had great luck using disposable vinyl gloves that can be purchase most
anywhere. I process up to 6 sheets of 8x10 film at a time with these. I can
unload film holders wearing these.

Good luck,

I don't have the Jobo 3010 but have the 3006 (came with the purchase of the 
machine).  I would not put more than on liter of chemistry in the 
drum.  Actually, Jobo recommends that you put at least 300ml PER sheet of 
film in the drum.  Look on Jobo-usa's web site for the exact recommendation.

Thanks! This confirms my thoughts! Now I have a question as to why others
use so much Potassium Bromide when it seems to lessen the qualities of the
developer? I just looked at my old Lootens book for his formula and it has
50 times as much P. Bromide in it. Seems that there has to be some reason
for this.

 Having used other Amidol developer formulas I just find it hard to believe
any developer this active can last several days! It takes about 80 grams of
Amidol to make one batch of developer for the 30x40's and this is a bit
expensive to me! I'll take any guidance I can and the factorial method helps
in this area.

I'd approach it in the following way...

Exposed some paper with a step tablet, cut one test strip from it, and
process
it as you normally would using fresh developer.  Determine which step
gives 
a medium gray tone, and mark that step on the undeveloped sheet by
drawing 
a line across the sheet in that position. Then cut the sheet into test
strips.
Develop one of the test strips for the same time which was used for the
first
strip, and note the time when the marked medium gray strip just starts to

emerge from paper base white. That time, divided into the total time is
your
factor for medium grey with that paper/developer combination. Also, pay
a lot of attention to the deep gray and black tones, and their
separation.
Use that factor when developing your prints.

After you have used the developer, and eventually question it's activity
as the
grey tone emergence time gets longer, run another marked test strip using
gray tone emergence time and the factor to determine the corrected total
time.

Then, compare the gray tones and blacks to those of the test strips which

were run with fresh developer. You may want to toss them in fixer, since
the
tonality of a dry print is different. If the low value separation using
seasoned 
developer is less than the "fresh" test strip, it is headed toward
exhaustion.
Also, check the high values for signs of fog.

It's up to you to determine the degree of low value separation which is
accepatble
and doesn't detract from the look you want. Also, whether the emergence
time is 
too long to permit reasonable development times. You can make up a box of
strips
easily, and it's a lot cheaper than wasting 40" pieces of paper. Also,
they give 
accurate and sensitive feedback.

Amidol is very active, and only needs a pH of 4.0 or so to start to work.
However,
in very alkaline solutions, it oxidizes rapidly. Often, the hydrochloride
salt of amidol
is used, and when just enough sulfite is added to neutralize the HCl, the
developer
begins to work. Activtiy increases with moderate sulfite addition. Both
the citric acid
and amidol decrease the pH of the sulfite buffer into a range where the
rate of  aerial oxidation is diminished, but the rate of development is
rapid. Also, citric acid acts
as an anti-oxidant with amidol. Hydroquinone has been used as well, along
with
some tin compounds. "Mossy"  tin supposedly increases the life to months.
All of
the tin compounds are strong reductants which don't reduce silver.

I don't if that helps or not, since your developer use and short times
tend to lie
outside of the mainstream. I do know that Michael Smith has mentioned
that the
developer is very stable, and doesn't exhaust readily. I'd suggest that
you review
your experience  - sometimes that is a better teacher.

On that note, I think John Gierach wrote in "Even Brook Trout Get the
Blues" that his 
uncle Leonard felt that children and dogs were  taught best by
experience, and that 
they don't pay any attention to concepts and lectures. Therefore, when
John was a child
and his uncle took him to the farm pond to fish, uncle Leonard didn't
warn him about 
the electric cattle fence surrounding the pond.

Take care, Mike

  Lots of snipping here....

  Its interesting to compare Amidol formulas.

The one mentioned above is:

Water			1 liter
Amidol 		8 grams
Sulfite		30 grams
Kbr			0.2 grams
Citric acid		3.0 grams

The Agfa/Ansco 113

Water (125F)		750.0 ml
Amidol			  6.6 grams
Sodium Sulfite, 
anhydrous			 44.0 grams
Kbr				  0.55 grams
Water to make		  1.0 liter

Dassonville D-2
Water (70F)		500.0 ml
Amidol			  5.5 grams
Sodium Sulfite,
dessicated			 16.5 grams
or crystaline		 33.0 grams
Kbr				  0.6 grams
Water to make 		  1.0 grams

Kodak D-51, amounts for working solution

Water				  1.0 liter
Sodium Sulfite,
anhydrous		  	  26.0 grams
Amidol			   8.0 grams
Kbr				   3.2 grams


  Note that Kodak recommends dissoving the sulfite first.

  The amount of bromide should not have an effect on the life of the
developer. Bromide is an anti fog agent and is generally used in greater
quantities in print developers than in film developers since fog is not
acceptable in prints. Some bromide is absorbed from emulsions containing
silver bromide. The bromide affects the induction period of the developer,
lengthening it. Unless there is a lot of it there should not be much effect
on Dmax. 
 All developers become slower as they are used. This is because there is a
slow build up of reaction products and some of the reducing agent is used
up. The accumulation of bromide also slows the developer, but again, is
mostly manifest as a lengthening of the induction time. 
  None of the Amidol formulas has much bromide compared to M-H formulas.
M-H paper developers typically are accelerated by carbonate, which tends to
cause fog. 
  Citric acid in the formula probably simply buffers it to a lower higher
pH lowering the its activity. Citric acid is also a sequestering agent so
may have some benefit that way but I've never seen any mention of this. 
  The life of Amidol developers is limited because Amidol is very
suseptable to oxidation. It is the most active of all reducing agents (with
the exception of Phenidone), active enough to make a high-contrast
developer with sulfite only. 
  I think the main virtue of Amidol, other than its simplicity, is that it
tends to produce neutral colored images. It is also non-staining so is
useful as a redeveloper when using a stain removing bleach. (Non staining
as a developer, that is, it is a prodigeous stainer if allowd to dry on a
surface).

Check the amount of alkali in the formula. Amidol will cause fogging as
the pH is increased.

If you are not using Azo, you might want to try other developers.

How long is this unlimited developing session.  Brett Weston used the exact
same formula for sometimes 27 hours at a time; but he laced his tray with
Dupont's B&B frequently.

I loose quality within 20+ 8X10 prints per liter; and this factoral
development formula may just save my tray.  Or, if somebody knows how much
more POT bromide and SOD sulfite to add ... ?

  Lots of snipping here....

  Its interesting to compare Amidol formulas.


Kodak D-51, amounts for working solution

Water				  1.0 liter
Sodium Sulfite,
anhydrous		  	  26.0 grams
Amidol			   8.0 grams
Kbr				   3.2 grams
                                  ^^^^^^^^^^
  Correction, should read 0.32 grams. 
 ----------------------------------------------

  Note that Kodak recommends dissoving the sulfite first.

I rated it at 25.  I'm going to shoot another roll at 12 as soon as I get a chance and see how that looks.

Thanks all for the many varied opinions on 4x5 processing tanks/methods.
If I had a dedicated darkroom I wouldn't hesitate to use tray processing but having to completely black out the bathroom every time I want to develop some film does not appeal. I am already not popular for the amount of time I it for printing.  I will probably opt to hand process using a drum if I can get hold of the used one which I think I have now located. 
By the way Eric, what is the total volume of a 3010 drum. I dont mean the max amount of chemistry you are supposed to use. I mean the volume of the whole tank to the rim without its lid.  

Hands up all those who have tray processed 4x5 film in the boot (trunk) of their car!

My thing was to keep the batch in the trays in the same orientation as I
load it.  And the 1 on top (or bottom, depends on how you like to work),
is that I put the notches on the bottom left instead of the top right

Just a heads up - It appears that a rather old virus has raised its ugly
head again.  Make sure your anti-virus software is up-to-date, and as
always, *never* open executable attachments directly. Despite what the

Precisely. And this works great until the negatives start swimming by
themselves, stick together, or one has one of those "special moments" and
either forgets to flip the first negative around and doesn't notice for 5
minutes, or decides in the middle of development it would be a good idea to
orient all the negatives the same way. I'll wager there's many other ways I
haven't done or thought of to mess up a simple and elegant scheme.

Seriously, one help here, to keep track of which image is which, not which
negative went in solution first, is to notch film holders so each processed
negative has a unique identifier.

Now that I see some other brew recipes, I might try it again.  Will I see an

Yeah.  I use the Amidol paper developer on Oriental Seagull it's super.

I/we are having a problem loading 120 Paterson developing tank reels and
wonder if anyone has a magic tip please.  There has to be something
silly going on as I get lots of jamming and squeaking and very slow
progress.  I have tried three different reels and all are a problem. 
Tried relaxing hands, tensing hands, folding the sticky tape which binds
the emulsion to the backing paper back over the end of the film to make
it stiffer but all not no avail.

Loading 35mm is a dodle but I do trim tiny 45 degree chamfers on the
leading edge of the film that feeds into the reel.  Should I be doing
this for 120?

Regards
Malcolm

Malcolm,

I do not use plastic reels for this very reason... that being said, it does
not mean it's too difficult..... may I sugest that you take your reel,
dismantle it and place in some hot water with some chlorine bleach (Na
hypochlorite) and a little liquid detergent.
After a decent soak.. take one ((preferably either an old toothbrush (or
that belonging to a unwelcome guest)) and give the channels a gentle scrub.
Plastic reels seem to be notorious for acquiring a build-up of a "skin" of
gelatin/silver which tend to inhibit easy loading after a while.

Cutting off the leading corners will help.. but make sure the reels are
properly DRY.
If you have a number of films to process and you cannot then use that
unwelcome guest's hair-drier... take a bucket of water (at temperature) and
load the film under water... you will find it loads a lot easier.. and for
those in favour of a film presoak you kill two problems in one bucket.

Just got back from an extended holiday to California thought that I'd 
add this to the amidol discussion.  In recent test on David Lewis' 
bromoil paper, i had noticed that it reacted quite differently to toning 
with amidol than with ansco 130, 120 or Formulary BW65.  I would suggest 
that you follow your prints through to your normal toning before you 
jump to it for a series of prints.

The first thing to do, is to make sure that the reels are completely dry.
Then with the lights on, practice loading the reel and see what is going on
(be sure to use a trashed roll of film).  when trying to load something new
what I do is practice with  my eyes closed and the lights on.  This way if
you feel there is a problem then open your eyes and see what is going wrong,

Malcom,
I had the same problems with my first 20 rolls, after
that the problems went away although every 10 or so
rolls still gives me fits. I think your fingers just
eventually learn how to do it. The 45 degree notches
didn't help me and they were tricky to do in the dark
without damaging the film. One thing I noticed is that
you talked about the sticky tape being used to stiffen
the film. The tape should go in last. It works best if
you don't unroll all the film before you start to
load, just move it off the film spool onto the reel.

I use the Paterson reels for 120 and they seem to load quite easily
due to the film being relatively short compared to 35mm, I sometimes
find 35mm starts to bind towards the end of the roll.  I do have a
nightmare getting the 120 started onto the reel though, I have a
problem guiding the end of the wide film squarely into both channels
in the dark and it never seems to get any easier.

Jason.

Well, this may be a matter of personal preference.  I like to remove the
film from the paper backing first, then load it in the tank with the folded
tape first.  I like doing this because the paper does not get in the way,
and the tape is slightly stiffer, helping to avoid those nasty
crescent-shaped folds in the film.  This woks best for me with metal and
plastic reels.  Comments anyone?

With the M. Smith Amidol formula I have found the following:
 1. Not necessarily deeper blacks but I find slightly better separation in
the darker areas of the print. My thoughts on this have to do with the fact
that the Amidol { Smith Formula } is a very active developer and maybe
working with the contrast and time of other developers would provide the
same results. I spent several boxes of paper trying to get the same results
and just about wore out my densitometer. No luck. Contrary to modern
thoughts about being able to match Amidol black with other developers I was
only able to match the Dmax and not the tonal response in the last couple of
zones. I have a roller transport processor that I won't run Amidol in {due
to the staining} so this forces me back to trays, so I had a real preference
to find a metol or phenodone developer that would work. My only quality
assurance is my eye and densitometer but I ran sets of prints past my wife's
eye and found that she came to the same decision in every case. { She is a
Certified Quality Control Manager in the printing industry with 16 years
experience so I also trust her eye }
 What I did find was slightly better highlight separation with a phenodone
developer similar to the old standard LPD. I've read that there is no
difference in the Dmax blacks with Amidol and would somewhat agree but did
find a better tonal separation with the Amidol in the last couple of steps
before pure black. The Amidol also provided enough activity to allow for a
waterbath tray next in line that could be used to lower the contrast similar
to the Selectol/Selectol Soft tray that can be used with standard metol/MQ
developers like Dektol/D72.
 2. Slightly warmer tones on some papers  while I actually got a blue black
tone with some off brand RC paper. I also found a tendency to get olive
green shifts with out selenium toning. I'm not able to answer your warm tone
question except to say that it will greatly depend on the paper and whether
you use Sel. toner or not. I rarely had the same tones with the Amidol that
I had with the Metol/phenodone type developers and it varied greatly with
different papers.
 Sorry for the round-about answer but this is all I know for sure  :o)...

I never had problems with paterson reels until I started shooting 2 1/4 film
a couple of years ago.  I had the same problems with the film jamming on the
ball bearing.  

I switched to stainless steel reels - specifically the ones made by Hewes -
and haven't had a problem.  I'm even using Hewes reels for 35mm.

There's something about the Hewes set-up that just makes it easier - I really
can't explain it but I haven't had a problem with them at all.

The greatest benefit, for me, in using Amidol is that other developers
(Ilford Universal and Dektol are the two I've tried) leave a distinctive
blue tone with Azo paper. The blue tone, which I don't like at all, can be
removed only by toning in selenium and the time has to be exactly right or
else the selenium changes the tone to a warm brownish purple tone, which I
also don't like. Amidol leaves a neutral to slightly warm tone. If I could
find another developer that didn't leave Azo with that blue tone I'd
probably use it and forget about Amidol. Except for eliminating the blue
tone, I don't find any differences between Amidol and other developers that
are of sufficient importance to me to put up with the pain of  having to buy
the materials by mail order and then mixing them,  not to mention the
expense.

HI Eric - That's what I do also. The problem, for me, is that I also switch
the orientation of the stack 90 degrees every minute. I've found that if I
always pull the bottom negative in the same direction I end up with streaks
in areas like the sky. So I have to remember where I am in the orientation
process in order to know which is the "odd" negative. It isn't
insurmountable  but it does require some concentration since there are other
things going on like keeping track of the time, remembering which negative
is to be pulled first, etc.

I'd much prefer to use the BTZS tubes for 8x10 but they're so hideously
expensive ($65 or so per tube) that it's hard for me to justify given my
amateur status and relatively small amount of developing.

Zone VI Studios used to sell a gadget that I found  useful in getting 120
film properly started onto steel reels. Calumet may still sell it.  I
stopped using it when I switched to Patterson plastic since I don't have
much trouble with it, so I don't know whether the gadget would help with
Patterson or not but it didn't cost much and might be worth a try.

My development sessions don't last for anything like 27 hours. If they did
I'd probably drink the Amidol before I'd worry about replenishing it.
However, FWIW, I've developed using Michael's formula for around six hours,
perhaps 30-40 prints counting proofs, without noticing any change from first
to last though I confess I wasn't doihng side by side comparisons or using a
densitometer to check. Like so many other things with darkroom work, I think
the quality (or lack thereof) of the local water often accounts for the
different experiences we sometimes have.

Hi

Thanks to all the kind advice received.  However one of the reels is
virtually new and they are always drier than dry but I will try some
some chlorine bleach and a little liquid detergent.  I have been doing
exactly as you mentioned George and removing the film from the paper
backing first, then loading it in the tank with the folded tape first. 
Ken's sugestion of loading under water sounds an idea but could be too
much fun in the changing bag that we use ;-)

Maybe I'll try another film tonight but with 45 degree corners cut on
the leading edge like I do for 35mm.

Malcolm

sems like there's more chance to damage the film with
all that extra handling, removing the paper, uncoiling
the film, etc. The untaped end of the film has a
little room before the first image so that if you do
accidently crease the film loading it you usually
don't ruin an image.

I've been using the plastic reels for years with no problems.  In fact, I
almost always load two 120 films on each reel.  It's the 35mm film that
usually binds for me.

I do just two things: make sure the reels are absolutely dry (a little help
from a hair dryer), and remove the paper backing from the film before you
load the reel.

I dont usually have a problem winding it on once its started but how
do you get it started?  I have to fiddle for ages to get the curly end
started in the two channels, its like trying to thread a needle with
your eyes closed!

I load it straight off the spool letting the backing paper fall off as
i go, I dont see how removing the paper first would help with
threading it in.

I always manage it eventually but there must be an easier way???

There is one way to ID the end negative that is relatively easy. I keep a
small fingernail clipper in the dark where I unload film. I clip two corners
of the 'index' negative before putting it in the presoak. This makes it so
that even if I lose count in the dark I can run a finger over the ends and
tell which is the first neg in the solutions.

Plan on a Utah photo trip in August 2002. Brigham City Museum Gallery will
host a photographic show, The Great American West: The B&W Landscape.
It features the images of Dick Arentz, Paula Chamlee Tillman Crane, Chip
Hooper, Craig Law, Ray McSavaney, Barry Parsons, John Sexton, Dan Smith and
Michael A. Smith.
This a show you don't want to miss and a perfect time to visit Utah on your
vacation. Brigham City is in Northern Utah, about an hour North of Salt Lake
City, home of the Bear River
Migratory Bird Refuge and on the way to Yellowstone National Park.
If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me for information as
I am the curator of the show.

Hello,

I also have been using the paterson reels for years with no problems until I
started to use a changing bag. For me, it's very difficult to keep my hands dry
under the bag, I sweat blood.

Best regards,

I pull the paper backing off and let it fall to the floor, just to get it
out of the way.  The reel is on the countertop with the two loading flanges
on top.  I hold the reel with my left hand and guide the end of the film
into the flanges with my right.  Push the film in about an inch and then
start twisting the ends to wind the film.

Practice in the light with some discarded film so you can see if you are
doing something wrong.  It's so simple, I'm always surprised that people
have trouble with the plastic reels.

I think you've just inadvertently answered your own question Malcolm - you
mention a changing bag. Almost certainly the problem is caused by humidity
from the inevitable sweat. I've been using Paterson reels for years and
never had any trouble, but I load film in the darkroom, in the fresh (sic!)
air. My method of starting the film onto the reel is hard to explain in
words but basically I unroll as far as the end of the film, then feed the
film into the groove, gently pulling the centre of the end of the film to
start it. Once past the ball bearings I let the roll unravel under its own
weight, the paper falls away and I load the film using the ratchet action.
Once the end is reached I then pull or tear the tape to relase the paper
letting it fall onto the floor, finish loading the film and put the loaded
reel in the tank.

I don't own a changing bag - the only time I ever tried one I vowed never
to use any materials or methods that need one!

Just a little edit note-
While "Pretty Park" is a real "worm" virus (related to
"Happy99"), it has nothing to do with the "Budweiser Frogs"
virus ( which has proven to be a Hoax). But the warning
still is valid from Tim.

Hello !
I use the plastic Paterson reels since I've discovered them, as I then
found stainless steel reels a pain.
Here is my technique (I use it also for 135 film) 
First check that the reel is perfectly dry (easy for me because the
climate in my darkroom is pretty dry)
Next unspool the film and separate it from the backing paper. Remove the
tape from the end.
With your fingers check that the end of the film is not torn, or bend.
(if it is, use the other side of the spool)
Find the reel starting point and introduce the film carefully. You are
almost done.
Do not use the racking system the leaflet suggest. Instead keep the reel
on your left hand, and, push gently the film with your right hand. Do
not hold the film too far from the reel, to be sure it will not bend
under the stress. Normally, the film will go smooth up to the end of the
reel without hassle.
This is longer and difficult do write than to do, or show. But it works
for me. 
Keep your mind Zen ian it will work for you.
P.S. I hope you do not have wet hands, as this will not help...

That is interesting about the separation in the blacks as opposed to more 
d-max.  It sounds like I shold at least do some tests to see if I like the 
Amidol MS formula.

I know of two sources for Amidol.  Artcraft and Photographers Formulary in

Malcolm & Sylvia,  I have overcome your problem completely by thoroughly =
washing spiral free of any residual wetting agent and then making sure =
spiral is completely dry.  I too bend sticky tape around film end to =
stiffen film to assist entry into spiral but find I need to pull it =
through the ratchet balls to get started.  I can then usually feed film =
into spiral without using ratchet action.  The occasional polish of =
spiral grooves with Kitchen Roll paper is a good idea to remove any =
stickiness from old wetting agent. Keep at it and you will soon master =
it.  John Jackson. Wadswick, Wiltshire, Uk.

I buy chemicals from a Canadian outfit (I'm in Florida) named Fotochem
operated by  an individual named Johnny Deiure. E mail: fotochem@colba.net;
web site: http://www.colba.net/~fotochem/index.htm  His prices are
significantly lower than Formulary on everything I've bought  including
Amidol. Formulary used to have decent prices but in the last several years
they seem to have gotten much more expensive than virtually everyone.  I
only recently heard of  Artcraft and haven't tried them yet but I've been
told their Amidol prices are even lower than Fotochem.  The only downside
I've experienced with Fotochem is that delivery sometimes is a little slow,
maybe ten days or so.  However, the prices seem very good, at least compared

The purpose of removing the paper, I've always thought, is to keep it from
scratching the film as you wind.

 I have been using ArtCraft { slightly cheaper}
  As I said before I am not sure if there is a dilution/time for other
developers that can duplicate the Amidol results. Just that I haven't found
it. The other plus in the factor for me is the extremely high print numbers
that it will develop with little or no change. { at least this helps on the
cost}.
 I'm not a photo-chemist in any stretch of the word and only can mix and use
other's formulas so take what I say with a grain of salt!
 If you decide to try it I would like to hear of your results.

 I ran over 75 8x10 Azo prints in one liter with little change.....was
_surprised_ and did not have a change in factorial time of even 10 seconds.
.....go figure...:o)
 I also tried printing a few prints one night and left the developer in an
un covered tray for at least 24 hrs. with little change when I could get
back to printing.
 I had used Amidol years ago with poor results and this was a great change
in the results for me. I've been looking for my college notes from 30+ years
ago but can't find them { they had my developer formulas and results at that
time}. I'm not sure what I used but the Citric acid was definately NOT used!
Memory fades faster than my prints..:o).

  A couple of notes on Amidol developers. 
First, I posted some comparitive formulas and have since found a couple of
others in _The Darkroom Cookbook_ Three are Weston formulas, which I
standardized to 1 liter. Anchell also prints a formula by Looten and one by
Mixim Muir. The Muir formula has everything but the kitchen sink in it. Two
of the Weston formulas and the two above have citric acid in them, in
varying amounts. The amount for the Weston formula is given as ml of a 10%
solution. This should be translatable directly into grams of dry weight at
a 1/10th ratio of grams for ml.

  It would appear from this that the main difference between other Amidol
formulas and Mike Smiths is the amount of Citric acid. 
  The content of Citric is:
Smith			3.0 grams /liter
Looten		0.6 gram / liter
Brett Weston	"a pinch"
Cole Weston		1.2 gram / liter
Muir			5.0 grams / liter (in working solution)
  The Looten and Muir formulas specify a Citric Acid stop bath. I don't
know whether this is Anchell speaking or the original formulators.

  The amount of bromide should not have anything to do with the life of the
developer. The bath will accumulate bromide from the emulsions of paper it
develops. Bromide tends to suppress highlight development (its an
anti-foggant) but it takes a lot to affect the denser parts of the image.
High bromide formulas tend to be affected less by bromide dissolved out of
the emulsion and to produce less highlight fog. Certainly, adding bromide
to a partially exhausted developer will not resusitate it, rather the
opposite. 
  The main contributors to long developer life are copious amounts of
sulfite, which is the main anti-oxidant, and enough developing agent to
prevent its early exhaustion. 
  As posted by Mike Gudzinowicz, the lowering of pH by the Citric acid will
tend to reduce the oxidation rate of the Amidol. He states that it is also
a preservative for Amidol. I don't know the chemical mechanism for this,
perhaps he will post again and explain it. 
  Amidol is a phenol, related to Metol and p-aminophenol, the basis of
Rodinal, but is considerably more active then either. Hydroquinone acts as
a preservative for Metol and p-aminophenol, it may also for Amidol. At the
nearly neutral pH at which Amidol works the Hydroquinone would be inactive
as a reducing agent, as it is in D-76, where it functions only as a
preservative and regenerating agent for Metol. 
  Amidol developer, BTW, does not turn brown as it oxidizes. The developer
can be quite clear and be inactive.

RW writes:  Consistant is good also.  The BW-65 (Ilford formula as someone 
pointed out) is not consistant from start to finish of printing session.  I 
think the metol exhausts before the rest of the active chemicals.  Amidol as 
slightly warm is good also.  I want to try the new Oriental Seagul warm or 
neutral tone paper.  I will keep posted. However darkroom work will not be 
happeningaround here for a few weeks.

As I recall, the instructions that come with the Patterson tank and =
reels say to pull the end of the film about half way around the reel =
before beginning to wind. This gets you well past the ball bearings.

  Malcolm & Sylvia,  I have overcome your problem completely by =
thoroughly washing spiral free of any residual wetting agent and then =
making sure spiral is completely dry.  I too bend sticky tape around =
film end to stiffen film to assist entry into spiral but find I need to =
pull it through the ratchet balls to get started.  I can then usually =
feed film into spiral without using ratchet action.  The occasional =
polish of spiral grooves with Kitchen Roll paper is a good idea to =
remove any stickiness from old wetting agent. Keep at it and you will =
soon master it.  John Jackson. Wadswick, Wiltshire, Uk.

Does anybody use ethol LPD as their favorite paper developer?

I bought some just to try something other than Dektol.  No problem with 
Dektol, just wanted to see if something might be better.

I am printing on MG IV Fiber with Beleler 23 C II color enlarger.  I like 
printing in two steps of filtration.  Maybe it's called split contrast 
printing.  I'm not sure.

What I'm wondering about is the dilution for MG IV Fiber, I am leaning 
towards a middle of the road dilution of 1:5 until I think it's wrong.  But 
I'm not sure about adjusting dilution for this paper.  Any ideas?

Since both papers are made at the same factory..and the chemicals are 
interchangable..is there really much difference between the two, if any?  Is 
Ilford owned by Kodak? Nothing like owning the competition!!!!

I don't know about color but sure do know about black and white

Richard,

Could you clear up a couple questions I have about compensating timers and VC 
coldlight heads.  On a non-VC single lamp head a photo sensor would monitor 
the light output and control the timer using this output.  A VC head uses two 
lamps both on at the same time.  How do you control the timer to take into 
account the light output drifts of two independent tubes?  Or is the drift 
difference between the two tubes so small compared to the overall drift that 
it doesn't matter?  Do you use color filters on the photo cell (or cells) to 
try to monitor just one tube?  It always seemed to me that with two tubes 
drifting independently changing both brightness and contrast control would be 
difficult.  The option was to use split filter printing, turning each tube on 
individually monitored with two color filtered photocells and connected to a 
two channel compensating timer (Metrolux).

  Ilford Bromophen does not contain Glycin. It is a Phenidone-Hydroquinone
developer. Essentially similar to Dektol but with Phenidone rather than
Metol. It is somewhat more cold toned than Dektol, partly from the
Phenidone and partly from the benzotriazole used as the anti-foggant.
Benzotriazole is necessary with Phenidone developers because Phenidone is
not very sensitive to bromide. 
  Ilford published formula ID-62 is essentially the same stuff.
  
  Agfa/Ansco 130 is much like Dektol / D-72 with the addition of Glycin and
additional Potassium Bromide. You can make a developer which is essentially
the same as 130 by adding to one liter of Dektol stock 11 grams of Glycin
and 3 grams of KBr.

Greetings to the List,

Having moved to an apartment from a house, my printing space has become much
smaller and even less comfortable. Therefore, I am considering purchasing
one of the B&W Nova Slot Processors. I was wondering if anyone's been using
these. If so, I'm hoping they would be so kind as to share their comments
and feedback about these units.

Thanks in advance,

Mark

According to Red Green (and a multitude of other "experts"), men never need

Mark,

I have a 3-slot 16x12 Nova processor and am very happy with it. Like
you, I found that this was the only available option because my darkroom
space is very small. I think that if I was buying again, I'd go for the
4-slot version - the spare slot would be useful for a second fixing bath
or for water bath development techniques.

My only caveat relates to the earlier discussion about bleach and
redevelopment - try doing this with Nova processed prints and you'll
discover small irregularities in development due to the pattern on the
plastic separators. I have never had these show in a regular print, but
when bleached and redeveloped in lith they show very clearly.

Hope this helps.

Guy

To expand on the LPD theme:  I'm very allergic to metol and dare not try Amidol
or other relatively more toxic substances in paper developers.

What medium or cold-toned developer (phenidone-based or otherwise suitable)
produces the best results on high quality graded fiber base papers?  I've been
using P-20 by Clayton Chemical (California), but photographers using Dektol
seem to get more dazzling prints.  Any comments would be very welcome.

I am using Netscape vsn. ~4 and I'm afraid I'm sending formatted text.  If
someone would please tell me how to turn it off for a single email, I'll avoid
the formatting next time--my apologies.

Thanks and warm regards,
Diane Kaye

Hi Mark

I bought one of the 8 * 10 processors recently. The main advantages are
increased working space and decreased odour problems from the chemistry. 

One irritating 'feature' is that the slot drain taps are half way up the
side of the slot making it impossible to fully replace the dev whilst
leaving the stop and fix. I really don't understand why they did it - does
anyone else have any feelings about this?

On balance I still prefer it to the trays, as I'm quite sensitive to the
chemistry and find the darkroom a much more pleasant working environment
with the Nova.

Paul

If you have access to back issues of "Shutterbug" magazine, there was an
extensive review of these units by Daryll Nicholas roughly two years ago. He
talked about some problems he found with his and some of his homemade
remedies as I recall.

Barry,

Had a good read today of your new book "Edge of Darkness"... and it's
really, really good. Will recommend it to *ALL* of my readers in the next
issue. Just looking at a couple of the illos in the book and comparing them
with your originals I have on my wall I must say that the repro is superb.
All the anecdotal information makes it compulsive reading... monochrome
printers will learn much from you. 

Congratulations,

Could you possible give the author of his book? I did an Amazon.com search
and found nothingwith that title that looked photographic.

I've used LPD for about 3 years.  Started out with a 1:4 dilution - but
switched to 1:3.  Find it just right - not too cold or too warm -

Good dilutions for both Ilford IV RC and Fiber.

Hi Malc 'n' Syl. Only ever loaded 3 120 reels, and had no problem. Other
folk complain about stickiness. I think it's to do with not washing-cleaning
soon enough after use. I put just used reels in bucket of water, later I
wash 'em in Fairy washing up liquid, the blue stuff prefered ( in the UK
that is) similar should do elsewhere. Also try pencil point graphite to
lubricate the ball bearing in the reel. GEOFF C3

Where is all the information on making the B&W fine art contact print?
I've read many years of magazines, hundreds of books, and I see contact
prints mentioned but not really discussed.  Surely there are a few tips
or hints applicable.  Is it really all that intuitive, I just do it like
I've always done it under the enlarger except without the enlarger and
it just happens beautifully?  For background, I'm comfortably competent
w/ my 4x5 view camera and the Zone system, have my own darkroom, have
mounted a one-man show.  Not an expert, but not a beginner either.

My 8x10 rebuild is nearing completion.  At 62 I don't have time to learn
it all the hard way, much as I'd like to.  I'd rather shorten the
learning process w/ a bit of research.  We're in pretty heavy company
here, some of you have no doubt written articles/books on the subject.
How do I find them?  Would gladly buy back issues w/ useful
information.  Would appreciate book recommendations.

Needless to say, I'm going to start anyway.  The wasted boxes of film
and paper don't concern me as much as the lost time making images that
could have been better if I'd had a clue as to where I was headed before
I pushed the button.  Do you have a helpful piece of advice?  (Yes, I'd
love to see two factions fighting over which method is the logical
method.)

Dick
I don't do a lot of LF contact printing (I am about to start doing more),
but there is one thing I am curious about - how, physically, do you go about
dodging and burning?
Also, do you use a variety of papers, or stay with one type?

  As developer is used the developing time to reach Dmax becomes longer.
Eventually, the Dmax of fresh developer can no longer be reached regardless
of how long development is allowed to continue.
  In fact, the true maximum density of the emulsion is _never_ reached in
practical printing. Paper has a curve like film. At the hight density end
is a shoulder, effectively, a falling off of contrast, so that exposure for
increasing black must becomes nearly expoenential at some point.
  This is of no practical importance in printing. The Dmax obtained from a
normal negative is dark enough so that the true Dmax would be
indistinguishable from it under normal viewing conditions. You can
demonstrate this by looking at a print with lots of shadow detail by
transmitted light, there is usualy some detail visible where the image just
looks black by reflected light.
  Paper is developed to "completion" unlike film. The print is developed
until the Dmax is reached. Contrast changes very little after the image
appears but the shadow density continues to increase until most of the
silver is developed.
  Development time is not critical as long as it is long enough to reach
completion but not long enough to produce highlight fogging. Fogging starts
after five to ten minutes for most developer-paper combinations.
  If you are making a lot of prints its a good idea to print a sample when
the developer is fresh and keep it around for white light comparision as
work continues. It probably should be kept wet to avoid the difference in
appearance as the paper dries. checking a print against this periodically
will tell you if the developer has gone past its useful life.
  When it does, replace it completely, don't just put some fresh stock in.
The stock will replace the developing agents and accellerator but will not
undo the bromide leached into the developer.
  Kodak gives capacities for its paper developers, but they are approximate
since the capacity is affected by the nature of the print. A low key print
with lots of dark areas will deplete the developer faster than a high key
one, there is more halide to be converted to silver.
 Conversely, high-key prints will wear out the fixing bath faster than
low-key prints because there is more undeveloped halide.
  Richard Henry made some tests of Dektol and other developers, publishing
the results in his book _Controls in Black-and-White Photography_, second
edition.  He found that there is little difference in brands of developer,
that 1:2 is the greatest dilution Dektol should be used at (he used 1:1)
and that there was little or no difference in the Dmax produced by various
packaged print developers.
  This is a valuable book, now out of print. If you can find a copy, or get
one from your library, its worth studying.
  I think the main way of avoiding variation of results when processing a
large batch of prints is simply to use a large volume of developer, and,
perhaps to dilute it less than usual practice.

Richard
I agree with all of this, and would add a couple of small points.
The first is that Richard Henry's trials showed quite a build up in print
density over extended print development times - and in apparent, though not
real, contrast. I never seemed to be able to replicate this effect. i.e. if
I had underexposed a print a little, I could not extend development to
compensate and produce a full bodied print. Richard Henry was apparently
able to do this. However, when field testing the new Multigrade Cooltone for
Ilford before its launch, I needed a comparison. The only other specifically
cold RC VC paper I could find was Fort's Polygrade. While increasing the
dev time with Multigrade above normal had no apparent effect, it certainly
did with the Fort, which was also much slower.
The Fort emulsion has no developer built in, of course. I found that it
just kept building and building in density, and getting cooler and cooler in
tone up to a limit of about 6 minutes in the developer. In testing further,
I found that I got an almost full bodied print with Multigrade without using
developer at all - just by dipping the exposed paper in 1% sodium hydroxide
solution for 90 seconds.
I feel the inclusion of developer in paper tends to distort the expected
life of the developer, and to limit the controls possible during
development.
The second point I would make is that the progressive exhaustion of print
developer doesn't just affect the maximum black (or its practical
equivalent) and the speed at which it is attained. As you mentioned, bromide
levels build up. Depending on the paper and the developer, this also affects
the image colour - often moving to warmer tones. It also affects the toning
capability of the print. I am thinking especially of selenium toning when I
say this.
My standard developer is Agfa Neutol WA. As with many warm tone developer
concentrates, this normally rushes up initial image appearance, then slows
to build the mid and highlight tones more gradually. It can also be diluted,
according to Agfa, up to 1:19 instead of its standard 1:7. I have found that
if I dilute up to 1:29, but raise the temperature to about 25C while
maintaining normal development times of 90 to 120 seconds, the hue warms and
the subsequent toning has a different more attractive character. I will
often push a few prints through first before making the actual fine prints
(happens naturally in evolving the dodging and burning routine with each
image). The bromide released into the developer gives even warmer shades and
even easier tonability. This developer still gives a very acceptable full
black if mistreated in this way.
If put under a reflectance densitometer, no doubt the true maximum black
would be lower than with a full strength developer, but the difference is
just not visible to the human eye.
I did once have a heated discussion with the editor of a now defunct British
professional photo magazine who claimed that he, "and any printer worth his
salt", could easily see the difference between a print max black of 2.00 and
2.01  He didn't seem to want to follow up my invitation to do a blind test
of this kind.

I am making my first venture into 4x5 sheet film and was wondering if anyone
has any experience of using Jobo Drum tanks for hand processing 4x5 sheet
films. Are they suitable for hand processing and what are the merits of each
model? Are they easy to load?. Does inverting the tank cause the film to be
pushed out of the rails?
The two tanks I am considering are the 3010 which seems very expensive or
the 2561. I was also quoted a another Jobo product id of 5110 but I cannot
find any reference to that one.
I do not have a dedicated darkroom at the moment so a daylight processing
tank would suit me better than tray processing.

Rob
The Combiplan tank is reliable, efficient, and economical. Its inversion
agitation and the way the film is held with a curve to its face gives very
even development, and ALL in daylight. Clever people can get 12 sheets in
instead of the normal 6 maximum, but I wouldn't do this to start with.

just the gentle lapping of the liquids and soft tick perhaps of the timer...
reliving the moment you made the exposure... and silently urging exposure

Wow Ed, that sounds almost poetic!

Hey, come on Lou, the Combi is hardly high tech. and it is certainly not
automatic. It is truly hands on, it uses very little solution, and it avoids
the real risk with tray processing of emulsion damage.

How can you say "wow" from a contact sheet?
Barry Thornton



After hearing all the mourning for APX 25 last month I ordered a brick from
Calumet.  I finally got around to shooting a roll this week.  I'm looking at
the contact sheet right now and all I can say is 'wow!'

Aside from ordering another brick, I'm going to give Kodak Tech Pan a try.
I'm curious what other slow emulsions ya'll are using out there and how they
measure up.

I second Barry's comments.  

I started (to the extent I use slow films)
with Isopan IFF back in the '60s. I found the best cure for "image quality
blues" is to move up in format rather than down in grain size.

Info just in reads.... Easiest way to spread viruses is with virus alerts...
this is the commonest way of getting folk to look at dodgy files or e-mail
by telling 'em it's a warning. when in fact it CONTAINS the virus.... ignore
any e-mails that claim to be about viruses...Kak worm and variants is a
known and easily defeated virus....follow the usual rules about opening
attachments... use Quick-View Plus to look at them first as it does not run
them, and don't download from dodgy sites!.... it sez!!!

Dodging and burning with contact prints isn't hard to do. Cardboard bigger
than the neg & easel with a hole cut out and overlays with different sized
holes for burning. Dodging as one exposes the neg on first pass.

Check out http://www.michaelandpaula.com  and sign up for one of Michaels
classes. Intensive few days of nothing but B&W processing & printing. All
contact printing.

Michael is opinionated as heck, but his results are excellent. And, if you
listen to his opinions you will find many of them are right. 30 years of
contact printing with 8x20, 8x10 and 18x22 inch formats, using Pyro
development with Kodak Super XX and print developing using Azo paper
processed in Amidol give him an expertise few can match. If you want to
learn using a method that works very well, attend Michaels workshop.

Plan on a Utah photo trip in August 2002. Brigham City Museum Gallery will
host a photographic show, The Great American West: The B&W Landscape.
It features the images of Dick Arentz, Paula Chamlee Tillman Crane, Chip
Hooper, Craig Law, Ray McSavaney, Barry Parsons, John Sexton, Dan Smith and
Michael A. Smith.
This a show you don't want to miss and a perfect time to visit Utah on your
vacation. Brigham City is in Northern Utah, about an hour North of Salt Lake
City, home of the Bear River
Migratory Bird Refuge and on the way to Yellowstone National Park.
If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me for information as
I am the curator of the show.

  You are not sending formatted text. 
  Ilford Bromophen is a developer similar to Dektol but uses Phenidone
instead of Metol. It is slightly colder toned than Dektol because of the
Phenidone and also because it has benzotriazole in it as an anti fog agent. 
  There is also a company called Sprint, which makes low hazard processing
solutions for schools and institutions. I think you can it through Calumet
or Freestyle. I believe their developers are intended to be as free of
sentitizers as possible.
  Some people have extreme sensitivity to Metol, to the point where it can
be life-threatening. I don't know what the relative hazard of Amidol is in
this respect. Rodinal can be used as a paper developer at about 1:20
dilution. Supposedly Rodinal is safe for people with Metol sensitivity
although it, Metol, and Amidol are all related phenol type developers. 
  You should probably use gloves and tongs regardless of what you use. 
  Sometimes you can get better results by diluting the developer less. The
fact is that paper developers are much alike; you should be able to get
good results with any standard formula. If your pictures lack some snap you
might want to check for highlight veiling from some source of fog. It takes
very little highlight fog to result in grayed out looking pictures. Kodak
has a downloadable booklet on how to test safelights on their web site. 
 Also watch out for flare in the enlarger. Flare in enlarging negatives
results in spreading of dark areas into lighter ones, a relult that looks
muddy to me. Lenses must be scrupulously clean. Check for internal haze in
lenses, it can destroy contrast.

  I've been using it a couple of decades. It lasts very well and doesn't
stain trays or tongs as much as some other developers.
  I use it 1:2 or 1:3 with the Ilford papers.

True, true...sort of. The Combi does cost more than trays, no? The Combi
does have more parts than a tray? And, uh, _what_ risk of emulsion damage?
Well, I did say it was "a dangerous thing to say.";)

More seriously, what I obviously failed miserably to express in responding
to Ed Buziak's eloquent waxing over tray processing is that I think the
experience of processing in trays is not to be missed, and seems to me all
too often given up on or avoided altogether with no particular good reason
or benefit.

Fair point.  I'm shooting 2 1/4.  35mm is reserved for shots of my son scooting across the room.  

In any case, I'm finally working in a darkroom of my own instead of sharing one tray of dektol with six other students.  In other words, I finally have a greater degree of control over things.

Diane,

I used LPD developer for several years because of my alergy to Metol, Dektol
and Selectol Soft were once my favorite print developers. However due to the
increased cost of the product I looked around for an alternative. I finally
discovered a formula P-72 listed in David Vestal's book on black and white
photography. It is a PQ based formula, relatively inexpensive to mix (if you
have an accurate scale), and has a long tray and jug life as well as giving
a very nice tonal range with most papers. I can send you the recepie if you
wish.

It produces a slight warm tone with Agfa MCC VCFB, and Oriental Seagull and
neutral with Ilford MG IV and Cachet. An additional gram or two of
Benzitriazole per jug of stock would probably yeild cooler tones. A 1:1
dilution gives pretty neutral tones as is. I normally dilute 1:2.

Don't know how this would compare to the Clayton.

Try 1:2 or 1:3 for cooler tones.

I've just read a couple of references to two print developers in Fred
Pickers book, "The Fine Print". The first is Baumann Printofine, which
Picker describes as being able to delineate close values without increasing
overall contrast.

The second is Ardol which Picker claims provides for luminous low values
with a warm tone.

Is anyone familiar with these two developers?

Thanks,

Don Bryant

Advantages of BTZS tubes relative to trays include (1) processing with tubes
is done in daylight, (2) it's far easier to keep track of different
development times for different negatives, (3) you use much less chemistry
(2 ounces per negative), (4) the tubes take up less space, (5) the chemicals
are contained so you don't inhale them while working; (6) the chances of
scratching the negative are almost nil;  and (7) many people find that the
tubes produce more evenly developed negatives.  The only advantage of trays
relative to the tubes that I can think of is that trays are cheap. If cheap
was a big concern, I'd sell my photography equipment and take up another
pursuit.

Dear members,

First of all, I apology  for sending this mail. As I am traveling
across
the US, I no longer being able to read newsgroups, so this is
the only way I can make a inquire. sorry that everyone have to
read my
message.

I currenty locate at Tucson,AZ for a short stay over, and am
curious
about contact information for Canham camera. It is the camera
I carry and I would like Mr. Canham to take a look of my camera,
if possible (great camera. Nothing really wrong, just some small
things makes me have concerns since I bought it 2nd hand and
I am so close to Mr. Canham.) Any information, such as phone#,
email..etc. is appreciated.

Also, I recall a company, which advertises in view camera magazine
,named Photoroma (or something like that), can anyone give me
its
address ? 

Finally, what to see around Tucson ? (I plan to visit the photography
center at Univ. AZ, but would also like to know some spots for
picture taking)

Thanks in advanced for all the helps.

Regards,
C.J. Cheng
Rochester, NY

 Baumann Printofine is a familiar name but I don't remember anything
specific aobout it. The picker statment is a little silly unless the stuff
created serious adjacency effects on prints. Oh, well. 
  Ardol was Ansco's warm tone packaged developer. I have no idea of what
was in it but suspect it must have been similar to Selectol. It was
probably packaged Ansco/Agfa 135, which was identical to Kodak D-52 except
with about twice the amount of bromide. 
  Ansco's other paper developer was Vividol, essentially identical to Dektol.
 Agfa/Ansco had some intersting paper developers, probably the best known
is #130. Its very similar to D-72 with Glycin added and about three times
the amount of bromide. 
  If anyone is interested in any of these formulas I will post them.

Joe,

Sorry about the misleading info... the message was meant to be a private.
However, the author is Barry Thornton who is very active on this list. He
will no doubt respond to you as to when the book will be generally
available... I received a review copy from the publishers a few days ago...
and will read it again at the weekend. I think most folks will enjoy it...
it's not a "potentially dull" standard reference work, more of an "insight"
to the photographer and his methods of working... and he makes damn fine
prints.

Found more info for you...

"Edge of Darkness" ISBN 1 902538 09 9 
The publisher's web site is www.aurumpress.co.uk

Snowman,
         I think Photorama is in Phoenix.  Should be in the phone book.  I 
envy your trip.

I know that there is an organization called Photorama USA that runs several
camera shows in my area. (Washington DC, Baltimore MD, Richmond, VA and
probably nationwide)  Any chance this is what you're thinking of? They do
have a web site.. www.photorama.com.  It has info on upcoming shows.

Brian,

1) Tube processing isn't done _entirely_ in daylight. I hope you load the
film in the dark :). Daylight processing is a disadvantage: One loses the
exquisite solitude of being alone in the dark communing with one's
negatives. I'm not afraid of the dark. 2) What's easier than doing separate
runs for separate negative batches with separate development times? And I
regularly did differential runs, say 10 films, 5 for one time, 5 for
another time, with no problems/confusions. 3) True, tubes use less
solution. Because tubes are _limited_ to total amount of solution. A
drawback with some developers which need more basic chemical than tubes
allow. Trays can be used with most any developer. 4) True, but not much
less. Trays don't have to be in a straight line. If you have room to
process much larger prints in trays, you have room to process film in
trays. 5) You gotta pour them in and out, no? And mix them? My exhaust
system removes all chemical odor. It is not standard practice to process
with one's nose in the soup. 6) A little practice, learn to handle the
negatives properly, and you won't scratch them. In 15 years processing in
trays I've only scratched maybe 4 or 5 negatives while processing.
Nevermind about the other inventive ways I've discovered to scratch
negatives :) 7) Yes, true with most all rotary methods. But, first,
properly processed tray processed negatives are quite even. Second, while I
find the Jobo gives measurably more even density than tray processing, this
unevenness does not show in a print, so it is not a _significant_
difference. There's a difference between cheap and inexpensive. A GEO Metro
is cheap. A Subaru is inexpensive. Well, relatively. Don't know what trays
you use, but mine aren't cheap. If all I cared about was finding an
expensive pursuit, I'd take up sailing - like standing in a cold shower
throwing $100 bills down the drain :).

Cheers!

Last night I discovered a lot of crystalization in my Edwal FG7, which
is 10 days old, decanted into brown bottles, kept under kitchen sink as
I've been doing for years.  I'm in CA and it hasn't been particularly
cold.  Letting the bottles sit in hot pan of water for half hour with
vigorous shaking fails to remove all the precipitate.  Does anybody know
why this would suddenly happen, and if it will be OK to use if it turns
clear again?

(Again) does anyone out there get rich tonalities, great-looking prints
with a non-metol print developer?

thanks,
Diane Kaye

I don't use FG7 so I can't help with the crystalization problem. However, I
have used Vestal's P-72 formula (mentioned earlier by Don Bryant) with some
additional sulfite added to enhance keeping qualities. Results were very
Dektol-like with slightly cooler tones as others have mentioned. The image
seems also to come up faster in the developer using the phenidone formulas.
Don't have the formula handy but I can send it later if you like.

There is an old Spanish mission about 10 mi south of Tucson named San
Xavier del Bac. I am sure it is the finest example of mission architecture
in the US. I have never been there, but am working on it. Ansel Adams took
a stunning picture there.

  Try Ilford Bromophen. Its essentially Dektol with Phenidone instead of
the Metol. It tends to be slightly cooler in tone than Dektol.
  If you feel like mixing your own you can try Amidol. Its expensive but is
famous for its quality, also tends toward cold tones. 
  Micheal Smith's Amidol formula was recently posted here with a number of
encomiums. It is:

Water			1.0 liter
Sodium Sulfite,
anhydrous		30 grams
Amidol		8.0 grams
Potassium 
bromide		0.2 grams
Citric Acid	 	3.0 grams

  Without the Citric Acid this is a pretty much generic Amidol formula. The
Citric acts as a preservative for the Amidol, which is short lived. The
formula should be made up just before use. Everything except the Amidol may
be mixed ahead of time as a sort of stock solution. Probably the live of
such a stock solution would be longer if mixed at about three times the
working strength and diluted at time of use. 
  Beware that while Amidol does not create a stain image it is a prodigious
stainer when it oxidizes. It will stain your fingernails black and will
cause permanent black stains on anything it dries on. Use gloves and tongs
and wear an apron when using it. 
  Unlike most developers Amidol does not change color when exhausted. It
stays clear, it just stops working.

I had a very enjoyable visit to the Saguaro National Park. Its in the Tucson
Mountian district.

The Bajada Loop Drive near the visitors centre has 40foot high cactus.

Dear members,

First of all, I apology  for sending this mail. As I am traveling
across
the US, I no longer being able to read newsgroups, so this is
the only way I can make a inquire. sorry that everyone have to
read my
message.

I currenty locate at Tucson,AZ for a short stay over, and am
curious
about contact information for Canham camera. It is the camera
I carry and I would like Mr. Canham to take a look of my camera,
if possible (great camera. Nothing really wrong, just some small
things makes me have concerns since I bought it 2nd hand and
I am so close to Mr. Canham.) Any information, such as phone#,
email..etc. is appreciated.

Also, I recall a company, which advertises in view camera magazine
,named Photoroma (or something like that), can anyone give me
its
address ?

Finally, what to see around Tucson ? (I plan to visit the photography
center at Univ. AZ, but would also like to know some spots for
picture taking)

Thanks in advanced for all the helps.

Regards,
C.J. Cheng

There are a couple of things going on. Amidol is very susceptible
to oxidation - very similar to pyro - which is the worst in that regard.
Sulfite is more effective in preventing aerial oxidation at lower pHs
than high pHs. Since Amidol can be activated fully at pHs less than that
of a plain sodium sulfite solution, it is to one's advantage to use a
lower pH to extend longevity. Amidol hydrochloride reduces the pH (adds
acid partially converting sulfite to bisulfite), and citric acid does the
same. 

Of course, if large amounts of sulfite are used only with a small amount
of Amidol, the pH is higher, and longevity actually is reduced. That is
one property which gets people into trouble when using the old simple
formulas since their first reaction is to add more sulfite, which speeds
oxidation (increased pH), results in fogging, and requires the addition
of bromide.

Citric acid can act as an antioxidant, both directly and as a synergistic
agent. It does remove peroxides from solution, and like sulfite, it
quenches the free radical chain reactions which are the primary mechanism
of developer oxidation (not reaction with oxygen per se). Also, it is
good sequestering agent for calcium and trace metals. It has a lower pH
and better buffering capacity than acetic acid, which are desirable
properties in stop baths used with Amidol.

  This is very interesting. Would it be desirable to use a buffer system of
Sulfite and bisulfite or does the Citric acid have some special virtue,
such as the sequestering ability, which make it desirable?
  The range of sulfite content in old formulas is at least 2:1. The lowest
sulfite formula I've found is Dassonville D-2 with 16.5 grams of
anyhydrouns Sulfite and 5.5 grams of Amidol. The highest is Agfa/Ansco 113
with 44 grams of sulfite and 6.6 grams of Amidol. 
  Amidol content varies from about the 5.5grams/liter above to 11 grams/liter.
  Curious stuff.

         I think Photorama is in Phoenix.  Should be in the phone
book.  I 
envy your trip.

Thanks !  And appreciate all the information about
spots around Tucson offered by many members.

By  the way, I came to Tucson from South, 80 miles
away, there is a Chiricahua National Mounment, Nice
place and, in my opinion, good for picture taking.  (www.nps.gov/chir.
)

I haven't used the first developer, however, FP's description is a bit
"subjective" 
as usual.

"Ardol" is very likely Hauff's Adurol (chlorohydroquinone or 
2-chloro-1,4-dihydroxybenzene), not to be confused with Schering's
Adurol,
which is bromohydroquinone (2-bromo-1,4-dihydroxybenzene).

Chlorohydroquinone's developing energy is approximately six times greater

than that of hydroquinone, and when used alone, its activity resembles a 
concentrated MQ developer. Also, it gives warm tones. The bromo version
is
a bit more active.

The "luminous low values" probably have a lot more to do with the
negative 
and particular paper than any developer per se.

I don't know what the book says, I've been using the tubes for six years and
it's been that long since I read the book. What I do is load the film in the
tubes (takes about a minute, maybe two with six negatives), turn on the
lights, (I don't think there's any system that allows you to load film in
daylight),  develop, pour out developer, pour in stop, pour out stop, put
film in tray of fix, remove from tray and put in wash. Wash for ten minutes
(it's a Salt Hill washer that supposedly only takes six minutes but I do
ten), hand up to dry.  If you like your Jobo, that's great.

  Plus-X sheet film will give this effect due to the low contrast of the
toe portion of the characteristic curve. In fct, the curve is _all toe_
with gamma which is everywhere inflected upward.
 
  "Ardol" is the name of a packaged Ansco paper developer c.1950's, not of
a developing agent.    I suspect from the published instructions and
description that "Ardol" was just Ansco 135 in a package. 
  Ansco made two packaged paper developers, Vividol and Ardol.
  Vividol was the standard cold tone developer, likely Ansco 125, which is
essentially identical to D-72/Dektol.
  The formula for Ansco 125 is similar to Kodak D-52/Selectol.
  I believe at one time Ansco also packaged 130 but it isn't in the 1954
Ansco paper brochure I have. 
  I've seen formulas for bromhydroquinone paper developers but can't cudgel
the source from my memory at the moment. My memory is that they are very
warm tone developers.

The citric acid does prevent oxidation - however, I'd have to go through
the 
literature to find the exact mechanism if it has been published. Other
acids such as acetic, or the addition of bisulfite to lower pH, don't
give an 
equivalent protective effect. Muir used bisulfite, however, with the
addition of Kodalk, 
salt and pyro, at seemingly arbitrary levels, it's hard to tell what's
going on, and
whether it is effective.

Ascorbic acid and hydroquinone also have been used to protect amidol from

oxidation at low pHs where they aren't active developing agents. They
might react 
with the amino-semiquinoneimine radical, and break chain reactions
leading to 
Amidol decomposition. 

Some developers (phenidone and especially ascorbate) are very sensitive
to iron and copper ions in the presence of oxygen, and the addition of a
sequestering agent might help in those cases, though off-hand, I wouldn't
put Amidol into that group.

If I were interested in "improving" Amidol longevity, I'd probably start
with Smith's formulation, add some ascorbic acid and use much less
sulfite. I'd add sulfite tracking the addition, until I had good
developer activity at a low pH. After that, I'd check emergence times,
and add sulfite as required to balance carbon dioxide absorbtion and acid
generation from develoment. On the other hand, that really doesn't seem
necessary considering the results people have with his formulation.

I do wonder if similar results can be achieved by tailoring a developer
to act as a
surface developer. All of the traditional alkaline developers aren't in
that category, and they tend to develop all of the exposed silver which
is there. 

Paper is very prone to halation (white base) compared to film. When I was
contact printing resolution targets from 4x5 lith negatives, I examined
the prints with a loupe and found that developing time altered the width
of black bars compared to spaces, which I attributed to an exposure /
halation / development effect. The space and bar width could be made
equal (as they should be) by altering development time and exposure. I
guess I'll put that on a "to do" list, like a lot of other projects for
which I don't have time. 

Take care, Mike

Hi Barry,
It's not my opinion - I've never kept any for long enough. But pg 9 of that
doc Richard quotes gives the shelf life of a half full bottle as three
months. Compare that to Rodinal. Somewhere in a remote village in the Harz
mountains the original 1891 flask of Rodinal is being eked out by the Agfa
hermit, 1.100. It's still half full. He may never use it all.
