OK, you've been bugging me to do this for years, so I did.  pure-silver is
archived, effective immediately - details below.  Keep in mind that I did this
at O'Dark Thirty so I may have screwed something up - let me know and I will
fix as soon as I can.  The web page has been updated to reflect this
new feature as has the pure-silver info file you get when you
first sign up...

(Oh, I also looked into setting up a digest, but it is more of a pain than 
it is worth, so I doubt I will ever bother.)

Happy archiving...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Due to popular demand (finally!), effective 10.17.2000, pure-silver is
ARCHIVED!!!

This means you can retrieve traffic previously sent to the list (as of
the above date).  The archives are collected into monthly files which
list subscribers can have emailed to them at will.  This is done by
sending mail to:

              majordomo@tundraware.com

NOT to the mailing list itself.  Let me repeat that: PLEASE, do not
send archive requests to the list itself, but the the majordomo
mailing list manager address.  This will prevent everyone on the list
from getting a copy of your request (which won't work anyway!).

Send the commands described below In the body of that email message
(NOT the Subject: field) to get what you want.

To Get A List Of Available Files: 

index pure-silver 

Among other things, you will always see two files named 'CONTENTS' and
'TOPICS' which summarize what is currently in the archive.  If you're
new to pure-silver or just can't remember when something was posted,
this is a good place to start using the command below...

To Retrieve A Particular File: 

get pure-silver name-of-the-file-you-want 

You can combine these commands and put multiple 'get' requests into a
single email message if you like.  You'll get several emails back -
one which confirms your request and one delivering each file you asked
for.

Is 12 minutes the normal time or the N-3 time?

Does anybody have a time for Verichrome Pan in Rodinal? It's not shown on
any of the reference material I have or on-line. I will need to do some
tests, but a starting point at 1:50 dilution would be very helpful. Thanks.

Tim--thanks for your tirade.  Funny, I had just been worrying that my
project might be too eat up with kitsch.  For example, I took a picture of
a foal yesterday!  OK, it was kitsch in that most people would agree that
the foal was really cute; but it *was* there and this *is* a documentary.
So, should you avoid photographing beautiful or cute things because they
are cute and beautiful?  If you did, you would be distorting the truth as
much as when you avoid photographing your neighbors' pile of beer bottles
in their backyard (which I photographed right after the cute foal.)

To cure myself of possible kitschiness, I re-read Milan Kundera's The
Unbearable Lightness of Being, wherein there's a long discussion of kitsch,
which he concludes is part of the human condition.

I know you didn't mention kitsch expressly, but rather talked about the
danger of romanticizing nature over culture.  But doing that is a form of
kitsch.

One thing you should know is that the urban landscape I am comparing to my
rural one is...Houston.  Ever been to Houston?  It is as impossible to
idealize the urban landscape of Houston as it is easy to idealize the rural
landscape of TN, hence the difficulty of my project.  It would be very easy
to fall into the trap of, "Houston bad, TN good."  But my god.  You can't
look at Houston without wondering, "Where did we go wrong?"  It is noisy,
it sprawls, it is ugly, it is greedy, there is little or no community
feeling, no loyalty to the place amongst those who immigrated there to get
rich and then leave, it is only about sixty years old as a boom town, it
smells of petroleum byproducts.  It is a machine for processing oil, not a
city.  (It has diversified a bit since the mid 80's, but that's just sort
of like a hospital having back-up generators in case of power failures.
The real deal is still oil.)

Yesterday when I was driving through my little hometown of Cookeville,
though, I noticed that the main shopping strip looks exactly like Houston,
only there is much, much less of it, and it doesn't smell bad, and people
are generally more relaxed and not as tense as they are in Houston.  But
it's the same thing, qualitatively.

I wouldnt want to cause you extra work, but.... I have all posts going
back to July when I subscribed and other subscribers can probably go
back further, would it be possible to retro add these to the archive?

Thanks for creating one anyway!

Yes, I can do this easily.  Here is what you need to do:

Split the post you have into separate files for each month.  Name
the files 'pure-silver.YYYYMM' where YYYY and MM are year and month
respectively.  Put all the files into a zip archive and mail
the archive to tundra@tundraware.com - I'll take it from there.

Shannon,
Houston is a little older than 60 years. I lived there for almost 50.  My
parents moved there because it was a boom town and I raised my family there
because of the money and now like many others have left.  I moved to
Fayetteville Tx. where there are no strip centers, the air is clear, no fast
food chains, and the smell is the fresh air. Come visit Fayetteville when you
can't get to Cookeville.

  If you don't get a definit answer from anyone I've found that the times
for D-76 are approximately right for Rodinal 1:25 and D-76 1:1 for Rodinal
1:50 for a number of films.

Ok, I can do that, but I cant figure out how to combine the individual
posts into single monthly digest-like files, or what format to save
them in, I'm using OE 5.5.  I have a "Combine and Decode" option but
that does not retain the headers.  The naming conventions and zipping
are no problem.

I requested and received the first archive, so I know how it should
look, but not how to achieve it!

Its a shame we cant create an archive that's searchable by subject, it
would be more accessible.  I wouldn't know how to begin setting it up
though.

I have an archive going back to October 1997, I can send you what I have
in the above format if you like. I probably won't have time to do so
immediately, however (i.e. I need a week or so).

I have an article by Mark (not David) Citric where he uses Tmax100 in
Rodinal at 1:149 for 12 minutes for N-3 and above .
He places zone 3 on zone 5 or 6 and ignores where the higher zones then
fall.
He does not give a speed for this combination but suggests it may only work
for this film/dev. combination.
Agitation is once every minute rather than half minute intervals.

I,ve done some tests and it does work although for me using a Combi-tank and
5 x 4 sheet film 9 minutes gives me a printable neg.

Regards

How this all relates to photography, refer to the last few paragraphs.
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Most people that speak this way have never experienced nature in an
unconquered state. Sad.  The reason most people don't respect nature is
that they fear it. For example: 70% of rattlesnake bites occur when
someone is trying to kill the snake.

I beg to differ. Usually the ones that understand "nature" are the ones
that ARE familiar with history, understand science and understand mankind.

I understand mankind. That is why I am afraid of for our environment.

(I am curious of your background and what makes you say this.)

The above statement appears to be a HUGE over-generalization. The ones
that don't appreciate nature usually don't understand it.

The world will eventually heal itself with our without the human race.
Nature will get along fine without us. Will we get along fine without
Nature?

Are you familiar with Frank Loyd Wright(one of those uneducated nature
worshippers)?

Wright stated that he spelled Nature with a capital N. Because Nature was
his religion. . . I don't have the exact quote but will find it if
requested.

In refering to 'Falling Waters,' "rather then a house, Frank Lloyd Wright
has built a temple.  A temple to man that is one with nature, a perfect
union with its surroundings."

Wright may be one of the few people in this world that fully understood
the relationship of man and Nature.  It is all about respecting the land. 

This is all we ask(us nature huggers). Rather then exploiting the land,
respect the land. Leave it alone. Can't we use what we already have taken?


> For a stunning treatment of the beauty of the manmade, see John Sexton's
> "Places Of Power", just now released, I believe.

In a recent presentation by John Sexton at the Calumet trade show in
Chicago, he spoke about his new book.

A comment that stood out in my mind was that he mentioned his struggle of
photographing these 'new' subjects. He briefly mentioned that he did not
agree that they should have been built.

We need to moderate our use of the land. Most decisions today are based on

money and convenience. Most of the world wouldn't think twice about paving
over wilderness if it ment getting to work faster.

The problem occurs when the 'best' way to do something is the cheapest or
the one that makes the most money.

A perfect example: There is a current battle taking place in the Pacific
Northwest. The common opinion of scientists is that four dams need removed
in order to preserve native chinook salmon(an endangered species). 
By removing these four dams, electricity bills will raise a minimal
amount(if I remember right, under a dollar a month). The number of people
that are effected is minimal (about four different farms among others).

Rather then continueing the barging of wheat, other options will replace
this. One option is to utilize an existing railroad(in need of repair).
The government current subsidizes the barging. This money could easily be
put in place to aid those that are affected. It 'makes sense' the dams.
For further info, feel free to contact me. I can provide sources if
requested.
-

Even back in the early days of settle the west. Manifest Destiny, everyone
thought they were entitled to there share of the land. We felt so strongly
we destroyed a culture(Native Americans) to claim it. 


*************************

PHOTGRAPHY: How does it all relate.

In one way photography helps preserve the environment by educating people
It gives them a a reason to care. In another way, it may harm the
environment. Photography causes wilderness area to become vacation spots. 

As a photographer, we need to learn to respect the land. Not exploit it
for profit.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Below are some exerpts from an article that was printed in "Alumninews" of
UCLA. The article is about the photographer Robert Glenn Ketchum.

Activist: Robert Glenn Ketchum Uses Photography to Impact, Improve Society
by Susan Hanson
------------------------------------------------------
(For complete article, feel free to email me.)

Ketchum has used his art to challenge the prevailing attitueds toward the
American environment - then to actively seek change in our society's
devastationg abuse of it. 
--
Ketchum sees such activism as an artist's responsibility. "I don't think
it's appropriate any longer to just wander around and presume to take
pictures of the randome landscape," he muses. "If you're really going to
use your work that work is chemistry rich and uses a lot of silver and
takes a lot of chemicals, then there ought to be some justification for

Below are some exerpts from an article that was printed in "Alumni News"
of UCLA. The article is about the photographer Robert Glenn Ketchum.

Activist: Robert Glenn Ketchum Uses Photography to Impact, Improve Society
by Susan Hanson
------------------------------------------------------
(For complete article, feel free to email me.)

Ketchum has used his art to challenge the prevailing attitueds toward the
American environment - then to actively seek change in our society's
devastating abuse of it. 
--
Ketchum sees such activism as an artist's responsibility. "I don't think
it's appropriate any longer to just wander around and presume to take
pictures of the randome landscape," he muses. "If you're really going to
use your work that work is chemistry rich and uses a lot of silver and
takes a lot of chemicals, then there ought to be some justification for
it, or else you are just victimizing the natural world as well.
--
In this latter role, he organized an exhibition of environmental
photographers who had directly influenced political legislation . . . It
made clear to me that photographers had been able to use their work
proactively in a positive political way," he reflects.
--
"In the Hudson Valley, I saw not only the beauty, but I also saw our

I will respond to this briefly and only once because it is too far afield
from the charter of this group if we go down this path.

Well, I have.  I was raised on an island in Alaska - I am rather familiar
with 'nature' untouched by humans.  I can (and do) appreciate nature's 
beauty without having to conclude that man's activity upon the planet is 
inherently bad or dangerous.

I am trained in the sciences and am reasonably well read on various
environmental topics, though not an expert.

Today's environmental debate is principally not scientific, it is
political.  In fact, it is worse than that, it is decidedly
anti-scientific.  Ask most lay people about global warming, for
example, and you'll get an earnest dissertation on the evils of
fossil fuels.  Yet the science of the matter is nowhere near that
condemnatory - there is no compelling evidence that
global warming is: a) man made and b) particularly unusual or
dangerous.

So do I. Life expectancy greater than ever world-wide. Food production
is at all time highs.  Many animal populations (like deer) are also
at record numbers.  Technology allows us to comfortably populate
previously uninhabitable regions of the planet with complete comfort,
thereby opening options for lowering population densities where desireable.
Imagine living in Phoenix w/o air conditioning, for instance.


> The world will eventually heal itself with our without the human race.
> Nature will get along fine without us. Will we get along fine without
> Nature?

This is ridiculous.  There is no credible reason to believe that the
human race is presently, or in any forseeable future, at risk for
extinction.  

> Wright stated that he spelled Nature with a capital N. Because Nature was

Right - that is the essence of almost all of the environmental movement -
mysticism, not science.  I have no problem with religion of any sort
when practiced by individuals.  However, when it is used to enforce
a particular "theology" on the rest of us without credible proof
of its correctness, that is unacceptable.  Let me repeat this a 
different way.  As traditional religion has been abandoned, it has
been replaced with a new secular religion who's deity is nature.

> This is all we ask(us nature huggers). Rather then exploiting the land,
> respect the land. Leave it alone. Can't we use what we already have taken?
> 

Why? Because an environmentalist said so?  When someone can provide credible,
scientific evidence that the land is being "exploited", whatever that means,
I would certainly listen.  But there is nothing compelling to me about
listening to people talk about their "temple" being "exploited"  absent
any proof.

Thereby giving an example of the collectivist agenda at the heart of almost
all environmental schemes:  Forcefully extract wealth via taxation to
serve a goal which members of the We Know What's Good For You Society
will inflict upon everyone else w/o regard for whether they want it, need
it, or whether it is even necessary.  The only way *sustainable* new
options are ever created are via free trade and open markets, not by
the boot of the government telling us what we must pay for.  It is 
noteworthy, that almost none of the railroads survived into the late
20th century - they were all born with government money.  The sole
exception (I cannot recall which one), was the only rail system
built entirely/principally with private funds.

My dear friend, *every* good thing you have is made possible because someone
wanted to make a profit at it - the medicine that heals you, the car you drive,
the film you shoot, the home you occupy, the clothes you wear, and the food
you eat are all the consequence of someone else acting with profit motive.
When you you decry profit, you slit your own throat.  Your very ability to
go enjoy nature itself hinges on profit - your ability to make a living
sufficient to give you the time to do what you enjoy.  Profit is just
a score-keeping mechanism for keeping track of how we all do value-add
in a society.

Now, let me chime in on *why* I ever opened this can of worms.  Great photography
is first and above all *honest*.  It certainly reflects the POV of the
artist, but it cannot be "good" and tell a lie.  When photography (or any
other expressive medium) is used to flog a philosophical or political
agenda (certainly a fair use of the medium), that work can be fairly
criticized both on its artistic merits *and* its expressed world view.
The world view of the majority of environmentalist work is grounded in
mystic theology and collectivist economics.  The former has little or no
scientific basis. The latter has been resposible for untold suffering of
countless billions of people over the span of human history. Photography,
thus motivated, is therefore, at its essentical core, a lie.  This makes
for bad pictures, a rotten philosophy, and a deadly view of mankind.

Yes, I checked and found time for R50/KB50 in Rodinal, but no info about 
R15/KB25.
Also nothing about these films in PMK.

Maybe someone else has got an idea.

Hi -

Does anyone know where I can find sheets of CC filters in a size from
which I can cut a 12"x12" piece?  I'm finishing up putting an old Elwood
8x10 enlarger together and made my first prints a couple of nights ago.
My light source is a new Aristo T12 cold light with V54 tubes.  I found
that the source prints a bit hot (too contrasty) for my tastes and needs
about 20cc of yellow to match my Chromega colorheads with the same
negatives.  I've checked most of the usual places and can't find filters
that big.

For those who haven't used one, these light heads are awesome.  this is a
beautiful handmade device - built and fitted like a Bentley.  The
illumination is so bright (yet cool) that my typical printing time for an
8x10 PMK HP5+ negative enlarged to 11x14 was 10 seconds at f/32 with an
Ilford MG filter in place! And this is a meaty negative!  I figure the CC
filter wil not only correct the color of the light to my preference but
will also cut back on the amount of light.  I never thought I'd have too
much of a good thing but I guess I do.  Aristo does make the same head
with less brilliant tubes but at least I've got power to spare.

TIA,
Curt

Snipping (you all keep old messages, don't you?)

 Perceptol is made by Ilford. From the MSDS it is essentially identical to
Kodak Microdol-X.
 Both developers rely on the use of sodium chloride (yup, table salt) as a
fine grain agent. Both have some ingredient to sequester dissolved silver
to prevent its being deposited on the film as dichroic fog. The original
Microdol did not have the sequestering agent and had problems with films
made after about 1960.
 The high sulfite content of these developers is one reason for their
fine-grain property, but the nearly neutral pH and very high salt content
is also part of it. The pH and salt tend to prevent emulsion swelling and
consequent clumping of silver grains, which is what visible grain is. The
actual silver paticals are microscopic in size. The sodium chloride may
also have some effect on the way the silver crystals form as they are
developed. The sulfite definitely does.
  In more active developers, like D-76, the solvent effect of the sulfite
actually increses film speed by uncovering deep development centers in the
halide crystals. In inactive developers, like the two under discussion, or
undiluted D-25, the film is exposed to the sulfite for long enough for it
to start destroying some of the latent image causing some loss of speed.
When diluted to 1:3 the solvent effect is much less. The speed becomes
normal but the developers are then no more fine grain than D-76. The main
advantage of using them diluted is the local exhaustion effects, mainly
acutance.
----
Richard
You don't leave me much to say! But I'll still say something - so there. I
agree with the gist of what you say about Perceptol/Microdol X, except that
my tests show that, diluted, they still have a SLIGHT edge in grain on
ID11/D76. However, they LOOK noticeably sharper due to the marked adjacency
effects you mention. HP5 Plus negatives from dilute Perceptol also print
very easily. The best way to describe this is that the highlights seem to
stay transparent and avoid blocking while macro and micro contrast of the
mid and shadow tones still gives a 'bright' tonality.
Peculiarly, I discovered the delights of dilute Perceptol/Microdol when I
couldn't any longer get what I consider to be the finest ever high
definition developer - Definol made by Johnson's in the UK. I remembered
reading an article perhaps 25 years ago by a regular contributor, a guy
called Raymond Lea, to the now defunct but then well established and
respected Photography magazine in the UK. He had run out of Definol late one
Saturday evening, had rushed to his local chemist who sold a little in the
way of photo goods. There was no Definol - only Microdol. He had no choice -
the films had to be developed that evening, and he bought the Microdol. He
used it dilute with FP4. To his amazement, it seemed to print as sharply as
Definol developed film, but with a lot less grain.
I was sceptical. I knew all about the grain solvent effect of this developer
and its effect on sharpness - or so I thought. I tried it, and I was wrong
to be sceptical. It is, at least with Tri-X, HP5+ and FP4+, very crisp
indeed. It's pretty sharp with TMX and TMY too, but the adjacency effects
are not as marked.
The drawback is that it is OK up to rated film speed, but there is no
reserve for pushing if the light gets dim.
For N exposures on 120 film, I rate HP5+ at 160, and develop at 1:2 for
about 14 minutes (depending on enlarger used) at 24C. Many of my clients
and readers of my book have tried this combination, and like it a lot. Most
find EI 160 to 200 to be right for their personal film speed - the same as
they use for dilute ID11 or HC110. In a side by side comparison with HP5+ in
PMK I conducted for 'Elements' in the early 90s, Perceptol negs. looked as
sharp in the print. That's saying a lot. My EI in PMK (or rather the
HP5+'s!) turned out to be 200 incidentally.
For N-1 (EI125)I use about 91/2 minutes at the same dilution and temperature;
for N+1 (EI250), 19 minutes.
Hope that helps.

Barry Thornton

Thanks Richard - last evening (that's UK evening of course), I took a flyer
at this. I wanted to use extra dilute Rodinal, and tried 1:75 for 12 minutes
at 24C (the equivalent 17 minutes @ 20 was just too long). The negs look
about right, but I'm going to print them tonight if I can, so I will report
back. Doing a little reverse extrapolation, I'd say that my guessed time
fits pretty well with your advice on D76 equivalance.
As to baseball bats applied to Kodak directors, I couldn't possibly agree. I
would naturally advise cricket bats.

  If you don't get a definit answer from anyone I've found that the times
for D-76 are approximately right for Rodinal 1:25 and D-76 1:1 for Rodinal
1:50 for a number of films.

Sounds interesting. By placing Zone III on Zone V or VI, he is increasing
exposure effectively by two or three stops. I wonder what the effect of
partial stand development might be.

He does not give a speed for this combination but suggests it may only work
for this film/dev. combination.
Agitation is once every minute rather than half minute intervals.

I,ve done some tests and it does work although for me using a Combi-tank and

They have them even if they don't know it! :o)
I have just received a complete 11x14 set of filters for poly-contrast.
and I think that they have 300mm and 350mm individual filters. If you have
problems { as I always do ! } ask for someone that can help with the Kodak
filters that they now make. If this fails try sending me an email and I'll
try to find the name of the person that helped me. After a brief search they
came up with much more than they thought they had. Kodak gave them all of
their filter sets and no's.  Very friendly but not well organized!

PS; If you get the chance would you give me a light reading off the
baseboard at 16x20 inch print size. Either a reflected reading off a white
piece of paper or a incident reading....any thing that I might compare my
11x14 reading too at the same size to see how they differ. Thanks!
I really like the Elwoods - mine still checks in perfect alignment after 40
years!

	For theatre gels try Rosco's site.

http://www.rosco.com/

or you can contact them at:

  calcolor@rosco.com

They also make a couple heat shield products (Thermashield and Heatshield) 
that can be used to reduce the heat transmitted to the negative in an 
enlarger.

Hi Barry
I got to using Rodinal 1-60 with agfapan 100 after reading the the
Goldfinger craftbook for creative photography. I found this dilution worked
well for the small paterson tank and their graduates which usually had a
total volume of 600mL, it also gave very good negatives.
Phil.

This is probably aimed at Barry Thornton if he is around, but other
Dixactol users experience would also be most welcome.
I,ve been running tests on three films (Pan F, Delta 100 & HP5+) in
Dixactol single bath, at three different development times (N, N-20%,
& N+20%).
Strangely, ignoring what the negs look like on the light box, when I
print them, (allowing for variations in B+F) I seem to have ended up
with the same PFS for N, N-20%, & N+20%.
Normally I would expect to have to increase exposure for the N-20%,
and
decrease it for the N+20%. Have I made mistakes, or does this equate
to your findings?
Ever grateful for advice.
Scott.

Thanks for the URL's.... I do need some IR shielding and this might just be
the trick! I had been looking for a source for arc light filters and bet
this is just what I need! Don't think you can ever have TOO much light but
heat is another story!!

Greetings.  I am a new member to pure silver and although I joined with a 
specific question, I thought that I would introduce myself before fireing 
off questions.
>
My name is richard warren and I live in new york where I work as a fashion 
photographer and recently an editorial garden photog.  Despite my commercial 
background I am very dedicated to the art/craft of the fine silver print.  I 
shoot with an 8x10 Plaubel camera with 12' Voightlander Heliar lens. I use 
PMK with Ilford HP-5 and contact print on Seagul.
>
I am in the process of setting up a home darkroom with a jobo and 10x10 
Condit enlarger.  The latter two subjects are what I will be asking about in 
future posts.  I look forward to contributing what I can to this group.  My 
web site is:

That's about right Scott. The variation for N-! and N+1 is tiny - usually
1/3 stop maximum either way. You can usually ignore it. However, if you do
meet really contrasty situations and decide to give 1/2 to 1 stop more
exposure to support the shadows, you can be sure the tanned highlights will
still burn in beautifully with separation.

Hi Friends -

I sent a request to Rosco on CC filters and here's the response I got.
This was a quick turnaround and the answer to my problem.  Perhaps the
info can help others.  I intend to stick a piece of this up in the light
head on top of the diffusion plexiglass.

Best,
Curt

Many thanks.
Any suggestions for time/dilution to start working around?

As I recall from memory, Fuji Neopan 1600 processed in PMK @ 77F for 7:30
secs. I meter TTL only and the negs are a little flat and of average
density. The grain is mighty fine. I've made very nice 11x14s from these
negs that are very sharp and have very little apparent grain in the print.
Contone areas such as mid-tone sky may display a little more grain on
contrastier paper grades.

Let me know how you make out.

Don Bryant

Great stuff.  I miss working with large format when I assisted in NYC.
Hope you have fun in the lab.  Don't forget to read "Exposed" or
"Exposure" or something like that.  Details the hazards of the B&W Lab.  I
used to work in a B&W lab in NYC and after reading that book, I almost
fainted.  Although, my employer tried to get the best stuff for fresh air,
my hands were always in 5 gallon containers.  

Hope you have fun with that Jobo.  Doing large formats on Jobo is worth
the money.  Look forward to seeing more...

Frankly Eric I don't want to know. I have been processing PMK by hand in 
trays.  thus the reason for the jobo.  for the rest of the chemicals I have 
made a great vent system inspired by an article : Aaron Dygart "The Well 
Ventilated Darkroom" (Photo Techniques Jan/Feb1997)
>
And Curt : I wish I was setting up an Elwood. at least there would be others 
who own one.  The serial # for my Condit 10x10' enlarger is #1; I fear that 
no one else owns one and since they have closed I will be forever trying to 
figure out this rig.

Thanks for the warm welcome

THAT'S IT!!

I use Pyrocatchen.  This developer is very strange.

It takes just a pinch, and a pinch and a millipinch can make a difference of
two stops.

I'm grossly generalizing but finally found my two magic bullets.

Pyro ABC is so much more wonderful than PMK and Pyrocetchen is more terrific
than expected.  For TMax, TMAX RS is worth every penny.

It pays to take notes and make the decisions on each roll or sheet or set of
sheets.

Somebody cam across Morely Baer while he was about to make an exposure in
the field and was watching the sccene, "What are you looking at?"  The
onlooker asked Morely.

"I'm looking at those whisps of moss from the tree and thinking of the
amount of pyro," he said.

In this whole world, I wonder what this guy who wasn't a photographer might
have thought about after hearing that.

Not knowing to whom he was talking to, looking at a coccoon wrapped camera
bigger than the photographer itslef; an answer few photographers would
understand anyway and there in the car at that was Francis, Morely's wife
just laughing, laughing to herself while this guy slowly backed away and got
into his car and drove away ... slowly at first then at breakneck speed down
this dirt road.

First I need to correct the typo that was 68- 70 (seventy) degrees; and no,
12 minutes is more than twice the normal time.

Actually, Guilpin uses Rodinal at 1:100 and MIKE Citric for the -3N
development uses the Rodinal at 1:155.

Guliardi uses D23 with 30 seconds agitation, 68 degrees and leaves it
untouched for 23- 28 hours.

(With that last one, you can fix it for five minutes without a stop bath in
daylight.  Practically! [ but don't try it] )

I think I have figured out how I am going to develop my N-2 negatives.  My
mentors don't want me to use pyro, yet, so I am going to use stock solution
(1:3) of HC110, diluted 1:30. for about 18 minutes, with agitation every
three to four minutes.  I got this idea from Ansel Adams' The Negative and
a couple of other sources.  I would appreciate any advice from anybody who
has used this dilution to contract negatives.

On the subject of landscape photography:  I just read an article in a local
Houston architecture magazine about Alex MacLean, who does aerial
photographs around the country and just finished a project about Houston,
which is displayed at the Menil museum here through January. I wonder if
anybody else has seen his work and what you think of it, and what other
aerial photography photographers you know about.

The article mentioned one Emmet Gowin also, in connection to this genre of
landscape photograpy with environmental overtones.  Is there a book of his
photographs?

One thing I have become interested in is the sort of deadpan,
matter-of-fact school of landscape photography, where no polemic appears to
be intended, so the photographer can't be pinned down as far as where his
sympathies lie, yet the photographs do seem to have a "message", but the
message is ambiguous.

For aerial photography of landscape you might find  Bob Perrons' web site 
interesting --www.bobperron.com -- and, maybe outside your subject, a book by 
Marilyn Bridges---'Markings, Aerial views of sacred landscapes'.  good luck 
with your project,

I have been experimenting with a split HC110 technique in which the film
(tri-x  at 320 in my case) is souped in regular HC110 (my standard
developer) for 3 to 3 1/2 minutes, then this is poured out and replaced with
a Kodalk solution for about 3 minutes, to compress values, with promising
results. Does anyone think this technique might work for Shannon?

Bill
Yes I do. It is covered on my web site under a section I call the
'teaspoonful two bath' where you can use many standard developers like HC110
for about 3/5 of normal development time, then finish for about 3 to 4
minutes (it's not critical) in a 1% Kodalk solution second bath. It works
well.

My Rodenstock Rodagon f5.6 105mm enlarger lens has started to 
separate between the last 2 lenses (closest to the neg).

I use this lens for 6X6 and it is designed to cover 6x9.

1) Will I notice a distinct and obvious point when the separation 
grows enough to affect the part of the field I am using or is the effect 
gradual and I just haven't noticed it yet?   

2) Is it worth getting fixed and if so who do you recommend?

Thanks
Stephen

Well, this thread has me thinking about landscape photography...if I don't
intend to sell it, why the he** am I doing it?  I don't wish to make a
statement or derive some philisophical meaning to my photos.  I don't think
I even wish to show them to you.  But I know what I am going to do now.  I
am going to go back to those places in may past that have made me feel good,
such as Beartooth Butte in N. Wyoming, the headlands along Lake Superior's
north shore, Saganaga Falls in Ontario, etc., and try to picture them as I
see them in my mind's eye, and put them on my wall to look at and feel good
when I am at home.

Hi Stephen,

My Rodenstock f5.6 105 mm is suffering the same ailment... and has done so
for the past 3 years or so. I have tried to get information regarding
sending it "somewhere" to have the problem rectified but gave not got any
positive information to offer other than the fact that I do not see much
difference in print quality when using it "as is" until I can find
somewhere to have it re-cemented.

I think my element "separation" happened over a period of time and was not
noticed until I had to do some gentle and judicious cleaning of the rear
element.

>My Rodenstock Rodagon f5.6 105mm enlarger lens has started to

I suspect John Van Stelten would cheerfully recement the elements in these

I just found a frame that could hold my 8x10 film emulsion downward in a
waterbath or stand development type situation. Does anyone have any comments
as to the value of doing this as opposed to just using a vertical or
emulsion up position . I'm not sure of the way the bromide wall will respond
in this case.

   Most lenses, maybe all lenses, made in the last forty years are cemented
with synthetic cement which can withstand very high temperatures.
Separation suggests a problem in manufacture.
  I would first contact the Rodenstock rep. In the US thats HP marketing
and Bob Salomon. They may even fix it under warrenty or even replace the
lens. 
  Beyond that recementing gets expensive. John van Stelten and Steve Grimes
will recement some lenses. 
  In fact, its not hard to do yourself but the cement and solvent is fairly
expensive, mainly because it must be shipped as hazardous materials. The
hazardous material shipping premium about doubles the cost of the product. 
  Optical cement is available from Summers Optical who also has a good
primer on lens cementing on their web site:
http://www.emsdiasum.com/Summers/optical/cements/msds/default.html
  For
some reason I don't have the URL for HP Marketing, Rodenstock is at:
http://www.rodenstockoptics.com/index.htm  There is probably a link there. 

  I will repeat, synthetic cements should virtually never separate. They
require temperatures on the order of 350F to get apart. The heat in any
ordinary enlarger is not sufficient to cause a problem. In fact, even old
lenses cemented with Canada Balsam worked OK in enlargers.
  Cement problem can be caused by imperfect cleaning of the surfaces when
done or defective cement or incorrect curing.
  Bob Salomon can be annoying at times but is very good at taking care of
his customers (which you are if you have a Rodenstock lens).

  More. I see now you are in Canada. There doesn't seem to be a list of
reps on the German Rodenstock site. I suggest talking to HP to find out who
it is. It may be that they also rep for Canada. In the US they offer a
_lifetime_ warranty, it may also be true for Canada. 
  Rodenstock Precision Optics has recently been split off of the original
Rodenstock company which decided to concentrate on spectacle lenses and
opthalmic products. The company will continue to make photographic
objectives under the Rodenstock name but is now independant of the original
company.

I just wanted to take a moment to recommend a local (Chicago area) camera 
repairman whose work is so consistently good I forget how much I
depend on him.  I just picked up a Mamiya C33 body and 65mm lens
I had him fix.  Both were barely functional when I took them in -
essentially unusable - and he overhauled body and lens for
a mere $155.  He does nice work, he is honest, and is a very
pleasant human being.  He also stands behind his work - the few times
things were not quite right, he promptly took care of whatever
else was needed under his repair warranty, whether or not the
problem was his or not.

He does everything from point-n-shoot 35mm to view camera lenses
and I commend him to your attention should you need such work.
When you call, tell him I said "Hi" (no, I don't get anything
for this ;)) - he'll remember me 'cuz I'm the guy who keeps bringing
him all the old cameras to heal...

I live in Brooklyn and do shop at Focus Camera.  It is the ONLY camera 
retailer I would trust here and you must be careful even with them that what 
they are selling is not GREY MARKET when you think you're buying USA.  I 
bought 100' TMAX only to get it home to find out it had expired 3 months ago. 
 They gave me a 10% credit but would not take back the film.

I bought one camera body from them knowing it was GREY and have had no 
problems.

If I'm spending BIG BUCKS I will go to B&H.  They can be trusted without 
question.

Stay away from the likes of Abe's, CameraZone, etc.  You will lose.  Most 
will stiff you in shipping charges, they will take your card number and bill 
you and then back order what they told you they had in stock and "some day" 
you will get a partial order.

I think the only retailer in NYC that can be trusted is B&H and I've heard 
really good things about Adorama but never shopped their.

B&H and Adorama cannot be undersold.  If you find a deal better than these 
two offer beware!

I have absolutley no relationship with either B&H or Adorama.  And as I said 
I will buy from Focus Camera because it is convenient and I can watch them 
put my purchases in a bag.

                        Regards,  Bruce

I would stick to B&H Photo in Manhattan.  They actually have a decent mail

For large format film and lenses Badger Graphics seems to match and
sometimes beat the prices at B&H and Adorama. Great service and prompt
shipping.  I have delt with B&H and Adorama for many years and except for
poor quality customer relations they have never failed to deliver on the
product or prices. Badger seems much nicer on the phone.

Richard,

I am not sure how long Rodenstock have been using the "lifetime warranty"
in their promotional materials... I'll have to check through a pile of a
various magazines taking up too much space in the corner of the basement.
My lens, however, now has about 25 years experience and as much as I would
like to have it "repaired" under a warranty, I would feel kind of "cheap"
demanding its being returned to pristine condition... and I'm not sure if
the "present" warranty statement will cover lenses of that period, sold in
Canada.... Their present promotional pieces make no mention of any national
restrictions.


Stephen,

I believe the current Rodenstock Canadian representatives are Kindermann
Inc, Markham, ON, L3R 3V8.

Perhaps you could get the warranty status from info@hpmarketingcorp.com

Ken

I have shopped by phone with both Adorama, (I bought a new Speedotron strobe 
system thru them this summer ) and have shopped by phone with B&H folks too, 
and everytime I have been extremely pleased, with no hassles or problems, and 
they have lived up to their end of the transactions I did by credit cards. I 
might add I live out in the midwest USA, and had always heard good things 
about both B&H, and Adorama , so I simply chose them right off.

 Even after 25 years its a manufacturing defect. Getting this lens fixed by
one of the re-cementers will probably cost more than its worth, my estimate
is about $150US for each surface. At least talk to Rodenstock and find out
what they are willing to do. If they will repair it or replace it for
shipping charges spread the word, it will result in enough sales for them
to make it up. In any case, they can write it off, which you can not.

My question is perhaps a bit peripheral, but a need some help: I am
planning an exhibition with 111 photographs mounted in passepartout,
mostly 40x50 cm (16x20 in). The surface to hang on is painted perforated
steel sheet. I have planned to use self adhesive magnetic strips, but I
cannot find any source where I could get these at reasonable prices in
such quantities. Any good suggestions?

Hello out there,
Frustration in the darkroom. Part 4521.
I tried to use some Foto Speed gold toner on very lightly selenium toned
Forte paper, with no visible expected results. The only slight change is a
very faint cooling of the image, and a slight yellowish cast on the back of
the paper. Forte Elegance in Dektol 1+2, wash, permawash, wash, Kodak rapid
selenium toner, wash, gold toner for 20 minutes (and I gave up), wash, dry.
Is 20 minutes a too short time ?! Does Forte paper doesn't like this
specific brand? Or gold toning?
Would be interested in sharing any experience with similar products and
different results.

I do all my ordering through B and H and find that across the board they are
cheaper, even though people keep saying that so and so has a better deal
here and there.  So I no longer bother price checking because B and H is
either lowest or maybe a bit off occasionally but not enough to warrant
spending so much time shopping around.  They ship promptly, I think it is 2
day air, so you get your stuff in a hurry.  Shipping is expensive.  The main
tip about B and H is to have your complete order written down and prepared
before you call, and then tell them it quickly, because they are quick,
sometimes impatient, and have once been rude. I learned to not dilly dally
with them and then this does not occur.
     I once got a chipped Day Lab from them and no problem returning it,
getting my shipping paid for, credit back on credit card, and prompt
receiving of replacement..

Luc - 

I too have had disappointing results using Fotospeed Gold Toner on top of
selenium.   Tetenal Gold Toner however works a treat.  (This on Ilford
Warmtone FB)

On one memorable occasion I left a sheet of Se-toned Ilford MG WT FB
sitting in Fotospeed AU20 for an hour or so with no colour change
whatsoever.  However, when I put the print in the wash the emulsion slid
off the paper and down the drain!  Fortunately it wasn't an important print
...

Regards
Richard

What places are you talking about, they're most likely legit, but some 
photo shops in New York deal in grey market products.

I've bought from  Brooklyn Camera Exchange, Gil Ghitleman,  Adorama, B&H,
Cambridge Camera, and probably others I don't remember. All were fine though
a lot of other people have had problems with Cambridge. I guess I was just
lucky. An error can be made here and there by all of them. B&H in particular
lately has been making mistakes with my orders, perhaps a consequence of
their move to larger quarters, but all were reputable and did their best. My
only bad New York experience was many years ago with Abe's of Maine. They
advertised a low price but then gouged you on the shipping and insurance.
This seems to be their standard practice judging from the comments of others
on photo.net.

Go to www.photo.net.

They have a review section with tons of reviews from lots of different
people regarding these
stores.

In one phrase:  Whatch out for massive bait and switch, sales of expensive
add-on's you don't
need, pushing no-name lens, etc.

Just go to B&H.  Have spent over $20K over last several years.  They are
great.  Especially if you
need to return something.  Thats one place many of the others fall apart.

  The Selenium toner may be preventing the gold toner from working. Gold
toner contains some thiocyanate, used as a solvent for the silver. The
Selenium may be preventing the thiocyanate from working. Since Selenium
tends to tone dense areas selectively ahead of lighter areas, and since
Gold works in the reverse, you may be getting a slight amount of Gold
toning in the highlights. I don't know what is causing the stain on the
reverse, but I am suprized its not also on the front. 
  You may have better results using the Gold toner first. 
  When used with previously sulfide toned prints, Gold will result in red
tones. 
  Gold toner, like Selenium toner, doesn't make much difference on cold or
neutral tone paper, although it tends to shift the image color toward blue
and provide some image protection. Warm toned papers are toned blue, the
warmer the original image color the more vivid the blue, but Gold never
produces the bright blue that Iron toner does.

I have never used Forte Elegance for selenium followed by gold toning but 
did a lot with Forte VC warmtone  and it worked nicely. What dilution did
you use for the selenium? Try several dilution (from 1+9 to 1+29)  and stop
selenium when the shadow have started to become brown (this work with
warmtone papers but much less with neutral or cold papers. is Forte Elegance
a warmtone paper?) Wash for 30 to 40 min and then try the gold toning and
stop it when you get the split tones you want. If you go further you will
lose the first tones brought by the selenium. With some papers gold toning
go further on during washing and also some dry down can be expected after
the prints are dry.

Fotospeed gold will give only a cooling off with neutral papers or papers
processed to neutral or cool tones. Try Polywarmtone in warm tone dev and
processed for warm tones ie controlled/curtailed (but not too much)
development and you will get more blue, but be patient. The yellow stain
occurs with prolonged toning especially if the toner is getting a bit used
and weak.
For really nice blue tones overexpose the PWT about 2 or 3 stops and dev in
very dilute lith developer to give a very warm tone sepia coloured print
(without sepia toning) and this will go a lovely clear blue in gold toner.
If split toning with selenium it is important to do the Se first and wash
well after hypoclear/washaid before going into gold. The Se will give plummy
or brown tones in the shadows and must be pulled before it goes further
other wise the gold will not take.
Tim

I bought a used Condit 10"x10" enlarger with no manual and no glass in the 
negative carrier.  Condit has closed their doors and will not help me.  
(they actually return my emails but simlply say they are out of business.. I 
was asking to buy a manual).
>
I believe I have figured out the enlarger but the "Condit 10"x10" 
Registration Negative Carrier" is a bit of a mystery.  Does anyone own one 
of these ?  The serial number on my enlarger is #1.  Did this beast even 
make it into production ??
>
Obviously the carrier is 10x10 so one can print vertical or horizontal. 
However this presents a two inch gap from the registration pins (located in 
the 4 corners of the carrier) in either configuation.
>
The best I can figure is that a hole is punched on two parallel sides of the 
8x10 negative- not on all four sides.  The bottom glass would be 10x10.  The 
top glass would be 10x10 also but with the corners cut out so that the pins 
could meet the negative. What supports this theory is that the lens mount 
can be adjusted  to move around therefor able to line up with an off-center 
negative. I have ruled out using a carrier sheet of film because that would 
be a poor design and the rest of this enlarger is a fantastic feat of 
inginuity.  I hope this makes sense.  Can anyone help me ?
>
thanks in advance

I have been dealing with lens & repro for 20 years- your experience is not 
their common practice. Jeffery K. is an unreplacable asset to the photo 
community.  Having said that; lenses sold there can be purchased cheaper 
elsewhere.  They are a family run business, that offers service with their 
products.  A place like B&H can not touch this type of service.  If you find 
that you must have a Gold Dot Dagor mounted in a Compur shutter, then you do 
not have a lot of choices.  Ken Hansen in NYC is where I do most of my 
business.

Thanks to a nice member of this list, I was recently gifted with a Vivitar
3900 flash unit.  Does anyone by any chance happen to have a manual for
this beast they would be willing to sell/photocopy/FAX so that I can
get the whole scoop on it?

OK, what's the current thinking on how leaf shutters should be stored:
Cocked or Uncocked?  If, Cocked, then does the speed setting matter?

Over the years I've heard both of these positions espoused vehemently,
as well as "it doesn't mater".

Does anyone actually *know* the answer to this question - "know" means
you can explain *why* your answer is right ;)))

Those fancy $20 lens caps that HBO peddles do not fit snuggly on the (equally
outrageous) UV filters I have on my lenses - filter brand seems not to matter
both HB and B+W exhibit this problem.  'Anyone run into this before and have
a fix?

You'd think for what these things cost, they could get the simple stuff
right too, grumble, mutter, complain ...

  I will waffle just a little and say that for most shutters it probably
doesn't matter. Certainly not for late Synchro Compur shutters of the type
used on Hassleblad and Rollei cameras. Hassy shutters _must_ be stored
cocked. 
  Springs don't fatigue from constant tension but rather from use.
Essentially the metal becomes work hardened from stretching and releasing
many times. The mechanism is a slippage of molecules in the crystaline
structure of the metal. As long as the metal isn't forced beyond its
elastic limit simply being under tension should not change it. 
  One indicator of this is that clock and watch springs rarely, if ever,
have to be replaced. 
  Certainly, it does no harm to store a shutter released, there is no
benefit from storing it tensioned. Hassy shutters must be stored this way
because they won't fit into the camera when relaxed.

Hello,

Sorry for the spam, but I have a 10*10" horizontal enlarger plus lenses that
is surplus to requirements. It's a DeVere with 2500W closed loop colour head
and third party timer/colour control  unit on a motorised chassis. Focussing
is manual or remote, neg carrier is motorised for positioning.

I wouldn't normally send this to the list but specialised bits of kit need
specialised people to operate them.

Anyone interested can contact me off list for further details.

Steve White of Luminos sent me a bunch of toners they now carry when I was
teaching, so I could try them and they are all fantastic.

At that time I was using Fortezo and had great success with both reducing
and toning with their [Luminos, the name of which brand for their toner
eludes me, now] Copper toner.

The result I wanted was the yellow gold of gold toning and got it from doing
the Sellenium, after the Gold after the water bath.  It was a sort of
tri-tone black, brown, yellow.

Another way to achieve that is with the sepia formula doingbleach, redevelop
but withold the bleaching to allow some of the black to remain on the
original print.  Then sepia and finally sellenium tone.

In terms of what these methods were designed -- archival permenanace -- the
sepia, sellenium is over kill; but in our Space Age, this tri-tone can be
achieved and last for ever.

Steve Shapiro, Carmel

No, I don't.  I teach photography at Montana State University. However, I
hear good things about Rocky Mtn, and have known several graduates of it,
and also some students have come through MSU's program that have also gone
through RMSP.

Hi Steve
This certainly sounds a colourful technique. Are you right in thinking that
copper toner contributes towards archival performance?

No Barry, it is not of course a recognised archival toner, but I'm not sure
that was what he was saying.
He said that he "got it from doing the Sellenium, after the Gold after the
water bath.  It was a sort of  tri-tone black, brown, yellow."
I wasn't quite sure where the copper contributed to that. Perhaps you could
enlarge on that for us Steve?

 The landmark paper by Lee, Wood, and Drago, of Kodak Labs covers tests of
Copper and Iron toned prints. It turns out they are _less_ stable than the
original un-toned silver images.
 Sulfide, Selenium, and Gold, all increase stability. For purposes of
protecting the image against attack by oxidizing gasses the trick is to
make sure enough of the silver is converted to a more stable compound and
that the conversion is uniform with density. The shortcoming of KRST is
that it is not uniform in toning action. Full toning with KRST provides as
much stability as polysulfide but partial toning leaves the low density
areas without protection. 
  Combination or split toning may result in complete protection but there
is no data available to confirm this. Peroxide fuming will tell if the
toner is protecting the image. Bleaching in a dichromate bleach removes the
silver and leaves the toned image. This can be used to tell how much of the
silver is being converted.

I wonder if anybody on this list is using a daylight tank to process 4x5
negatives. I have been using tanks and the dip-and-dunk method, but I have
been thinking of switching to a daylight tank.  My normal time in the open
tanks is six minutes. I think I should probably increase that time if I use
a daylight tank, but by how much?

check out the BZTS tubes from Darkroom Innovations (which has changed 
it's name to the View Camera Store)
<http://www.viewcamerastore.com>

These daylight "tubes" for developing 4X5 sheet film seem to always get 
raves from users.
Other daylight tanks never seem to get raves....

There is an outfit in the UK called Oldtimers who have copies of instruction
manuals for old camers etc.  They may cover flash guns, I don't know if they
do or not.
Their telephone number is +44 (0)20 8953 5479.
May be worth a try.

I was trying to archive a message in my drafts folder; and wound up
sending it to the list. My apologies.
	Recently I asked for assistance on strange streaking with Ilford Delta
3200 and DD-X.  I never really found an answer, but Ilford tech services
did suggest I was agitating too much, and should not use distilled water
for the mix.  It seems the developer is designed for use with tap
water.  Taking these suggestions, I did a few more rolls, and still got
the streaks.  I'm going to send the negatives to Ilford, and let you
know what their comment is.
	Regards,
	Phil Stiles

What size film were you using - 35 or 120?

I've processed Delta 100 (35mm) in a small tank using distilled water/DDX
with no problem.

  That sounds to me more like just a guess rather than having a clue.

  Try using the half-full tank method; put the loaded reel on the bottom,
an empty reel on top, and use only enough solution to cover the bottom
reel. Give 30 seconds continuous inversion agitation, then five seconds
(two to three inversions) every 30 seconds. Don't use a presoak.
  The effect is that the film is lifted out of the developer and then
sloshed back in a couple of times every 30 seconds; if Ilford's right
you'll get worse streaking, but I'll bet the problem is really insufficient
agitation and you won't get any streaks.
  BTW, I'll be away for a week and can't follow up, but I'll be interested
to learn whether or not that solves the problem.

  The only ordinary rectangular tank I've ever tried that makes sufficient
agitation and good evenness possible is the HP Combi-Plan tank, but since
fill and dump times are virtually forever it works best if filled and
dumped in the dark.
  The common Yankee tank etc is pretty useless.
  Hunt up a Unicolor 8x10 print drum; you can load a 4x5 sheet on each side
or, if you have or make the little rubber divider to prevent them from
slipping together, two sheets on each side. You can use either the motor
roller or just roll the drum back and forth on a tabletop.
  The Unicolor drum is I believe the only one that has the necessary
internal ribs that let solutions get around to the base side of the film.

I looked at this site, but couldn't figure out how to order one of these.
HP is the distributor. I wonder how you find a dealer?

The Combi-tank is an excellent tank but does have one dis-advantage with 5 x
4 sheet film. It is prone to film jumping between slots during agitation.
I have got over this with mine by buying additional inner parts and
screwing/bonding an additional foot and upper clip retainer by cannibalising
parts. Screws are covered with araldite afterwards to prevent rusting and
mixture contamination. This works very well and even very rough inversions
do not give me slot jumping.
Can e-mail direct to interested parties scans of design if requested.

Although this tank is slow to fill (30 seconds) it is also slow to empty (30
seconds) so this is self compensating and of course is catered for when
carrying out your own tests--you all do that don't you.

It should also be used so that the fill on the top cover is at the opposite
end to the drain on the body.
If not the mixture flows out both fill and drain simultaneously which is
seriously unhelpfull.

I use them all the time, but you know, I cheat:  I have two tanks, and the
first one has the water in it for the presoak; then I have the other filled
already with the developer and take the sheet film holder out of the water
and plop into the developer in one swoop, jam on the lid, and then agitate
with the lights on.  When time to remove developer I turn off the lights,
lift the entire film holder out and plop it in fresh water for my stop,
meanwhile throw out developer, rinse tank, and pour fixer into the other
tank, and then so on.  I also do 12 sheets of 4x5 at once, emulsion sides
facing out, back to back, with fiberglass screening cut to 4x5 between the
two.  I've never had a problem developing.

  I use an old Nikor cut film tank and also print drums. The Nikor tank has
not been made for many years but is sill available used occasionally. It
resembles a large sized roll film tank with an adjustable reel which takes
12 sheets of film up to 4x5. It holds about a quart of solution. filling
and draining time is fairly slow but this really makes a difference only
for the developer and does not result in noticable uneveness if development
times are not very short. In any case, it can be filled in advance and the
film reel dropped in as recommended by Kodak for roll film tanks. Its
agitated by inversion. Because the agitation is a little different than a
normal large tank I use development times a little shorter than those given
in the charts. 
  When processing smaller amounts of film, or for 8x10, I use old Unicolor
or Besseler drums. The main fault I've found with these is that I get
bromide streaking when using the motor base. If I remove the drums from the
base and agitate sideways occasionally the problem doesn't occur. Evidently
there is so little turbulance inside the drum that the reaction products
are carried back and fourth over the same area of the film. The streaking
happens in the vicinity of very dense areas; a trail of lower density
appearing on either side in the direction of rotation. When agitated by
hand with some side motion, or with side motion on the motor base, I get
very even development. 
  Enough solution must be in the tank to avoid a dense area at the ends of
the travel due to increased turbulance when the drum reverses. 
  I bought a Yankee tank several years ago when I started using sheet film
after a hiatus. Its useless as a daylight tank. Fairly good agitation can
be had by working in the dark and lifting the whole film cage out, no real
advantage over the conventional sheet film tanks and film holders. 
  If you can find a Nikor tand, they are dandy, but make sure its all
there. It has a shaped flat spring which goes around the reel to hold the
film in place. You could probably makeshift something if its missing but
better if everything is there

You mean you sandwich a 4x5 piece of fiberglass between two sheets?
(emulsion facing outward obviously).

Oh, maybe I classified it wrong:  anyway, it is that screen material you get
at any hardware store; it looks like normal metal screening but it is either
fiberglass or plastic, but whatever it is not metal even tho it looks like
it because it is grey.  It is also flexible and thin.  It fits perfectly,
when cut to fit, with the two negs emulsion side out, in those slots of the
combi plan. My teacher did this and had this technique published in some
magazine so I do not take credit for it.  It was Rudi Dietrich.

Richard,
The reason I tried in the first place was because the label claims that
split-toning may be done after using a selenium toning. They do push their
selenium formula, so I suppose it's supposed to work with what they sell.
I'll give a try with Tetenal.

To all list members who joined this discussion: as usual, thank you for the

I have a Gitso Tripod { 3** series}  with the metal spike feet. This is from
a newer version of the tripods and has the approximately 1 1/2 inch metal
spike with rubber feet that snap over the spikes. There are no rubber feet
in the US and no one knows when there will be. I don't know who to check in
Europe for these feet. Is there a way to contact Gitso directly?
Bogen is the US importer and "plans to have some is a few months"....just a
bit longer than I hope to wait!
Any help would be great!

Chuck,

Assuming you mean Gitzo <s> you might try http://www.gitzo.com/

You may want to try their web site at http://www.gitzo.com (with a z).
It's a French company, and I do not know if they will sell directly or ship
to the U.S. If they sell but don't ship overseas, ask if they can ship to a
french address. I'll give you the address of a friend and he'll mail forward
it to you.
Good luck.

The Combi-tank takes 1050ml developer etc. so when devving 12 sheets of film
at a time this is only 87,5ml of dev. per sheet.
Isthis OK? Seems very low to me. Do you reduce the dilution to compensate
for this or is there no difference in practice?
Sounds like a whole lot of fun loading the film though!

Regards

JR

Yes, I always make sure to have 100 ml of Xtol per 80 sq inches of film;
hence, the only dilutions you can use with 12 sheets of film in the tank are
up to 1:2 (e.g. full strength, 1:1 and 1:2).  I think I had it figured out
that you could do up to 10 sheets with the 1:3 dilution.  Kodak doesn't
recommend 1:3 anyway, for what it is worth, and actually recommends 1:1 over
full strength and 1:2, or at least the two tech guys I talked to said as
much.

   No, I meant what I wrote. Kodak Rapid Selenium Toner tends to work on
the smallest silver grains first. They are generally the lest sensitive so
are found where there is the most exposure, namely the more dense areas.
Selenium tends to tone dense areas before lighter ones. This was the
problem that led to oxidizing effects on microfilm.
   Sulfiding toners tend to do the opposite, toning the least dense areas
first. That is why one can get split tones with gold where the highlights
go red and dense areas are blue. Both bleach and redevelop and hypo-alum
type sepia toners split tone. Supposedly, Nelson's Gold does not and
polysulfide toners, like Kodak Brown Toner do not split tone.
  The amount of splitting with KRST is likely to vary with emulsions, it
certainly varies with dilution.

Correct (of course) I misunderstood what you were saying, I thiught you were
saying KRST toned light areas first - which I assumed was a typo

  To quote Joel Cairo in "The Maltese Falcon" "Perhaps I expressed myself
badly.."
  We need some equivalent to Typo for this, perhaps braino for
brainographical error?  Of course then you must explain what a brainograph
is. I guess a whole-head MRI could be called this. I had one a while back
(because of Tinitus) and was astonished that everything was still there. I
thought that at least a part of my memory would be shriveled up like a used
balloon (the part that knows where the keys are).

You would think that after 15 years I could spell my tripod name! { Senior
Moment? }
Thanks for all the info from everyone.
 I haven't been able to contact them so far as all my emails to "Help@ both
Gitzo and Manfrotto come back as  "This message could not be delivered"
"not found on server". I'm just clicking on the provided URL and also trying
to copy/paste it but no luck,... guess that some default is not set right
but at least I have been to the websites!

I just cracked open a new case of Zone VI Paper Developer a month or
so ago - all of a sudden, I had massive inconsistency and problems
developing things, which in the past, had been no sweat to print.

I made another batch on the chance that I mixed the first batch
incorrectly.  No dice - paper thrown into the developer would
not turn black even after the lights were turned on!

Fortunately, Calumet took back the remainder, credited me the
full purchase price, and all is well with Dektol.

So, if you use this developer, be forewarned, there is at least one batch
of bad stuff around - there may be more...

Use it all the time.  haven't come across any bad batches yet...just 
the occasional brown color of part A.

I've shopped extensively at both B&H and Adorama, and prefer B&H hands down. 
  Their sales staff is knowledgeable, patient, friendly and they obviously 
care about treating customers as people.  They also carry many more 
hard-to-find items than Adorama does.

Adorama, on the other hand, while competent, has long had the reputation of 
having NASTY, IMPATIENT sales people--and my recent experience bears this 
out.  Strange how they've managed to stay in biz all these years.

Now that B&H has moved to a different neighborhood, I'm stuck w/Adorama, 
which is near my darkroom in the photo district.

Please bear in mind that my experiences are in-store ones, since I live in 
NYC & have never gone the mail- or phone-order route.

If you're in that neighborhood, why not go to Calumet?  They're one block uptown
from Adorama and very nice.

My best experiences have been with B&H and with Abbey
Camera. Abbey has been especially helpful. I was
interested in a Fuji GSW 690 and the the Abbey store
loaned me one for a week so I could see if I liked it.
Abbey also seems to have good prices.

True enough, but they're also significantly more expensive!

I normally shoot large format HP5 and will be using a 645 camera for some
"swamp and hanging moss" subjects. I plan to use FP4 for the first time in
years to get better grain and sharpness for the smaller format{ I was given
a "brick" of the film to use! ...can't turn this down  :o) }.
Any thoughts on the differences/similarities?
 If I use 125 as my EI for the HP5 would a similar -stop and a half or so-
drop in EI give me a similar density with the FP4+?
 I don't have time to run test so any help would be great!
Thanks,
Chuck

Chuck -

I use FP4+ frequently in 35mm, 120 and 4x5.  I develop in PMK for 10 min
at 70 deg. for N.  I shoot at 80 ASA, placing shadows at zone 3 1/2
(though I am starting to place them higher, lately).  FP4+ has a beautiful
long tonal range but you must be careful to give the shadows plenty of
support in hard lighting, else the negatives become unprintable real
quick...unlike with HP5+.  With rollfilm you need to be cognizant of this
characteristic because even in PMK, the CI goes off the charts.  In flat
lighting, I really prefer this emulsion to DP100.  In sharp lighting, I
prefer DP100.  You can certainly process the film in an MQ developer and
to start, I'd shoot it at 64 and pull 20% from the manufacturer's TT recs.
I've had good luck with FP4+ thus processed.

Let us know.

Regards,
Curt

Thanks!
  What is DP100?
I'll be working in areas that need good shadow detail { as usual  :o) } and
thank you for the note to give at least full exposure or maybe even just a
bit extra! The water is very black with details and reflections that will
matter!
 I'll probably try PMK on the film so am wondering what PMK looks like
 grain structure} in 645 negs printed large..
 I had only a brief time to try Barry's DiXactol before getting "covered up"
with work so might also try it after some testing. About half of the images
are for a book but the rest will be for sale as 16x20 prints so I am hoping
the grain will hold up in that size. { if you're reading this Barry, no
snide remarks about printing too big.....I can't help it I'm addicted }

Calumet may be a bit more expensive, but you DO get what you pay for.

Lens and Repro are great people also.

For the original poster, reviews of most mail-order camera stores you were
referring to in NJ and Brooklyn can be found in the community/reviews
section of my favorite site, www.photo.net

The end result:  most people get stuck with grey market stuff or bait and
switched
to something else.

I have always shoped at B&H (advanced amateur/darkroom stuff) although my
cousin
a commercial photographer liked buying cameras from Lens and Repro (they
credit rental fees
to the sale if you buy a new version of what you rented).

Acceptable.  I'm not a "grain fiend" personally.  I think you'll find it
very reasonable with smooth tones.  I also shoot 8x10 so I know there is a
difference in what the formats can produce so you'll need to make your own
choices in this regard.

Best,

Thanks Ken,  the  Rodenstock Canadian representatives are
Kindermann Inc, Markham, ON, L3R 3V8.

I talked to a knowlegable gentleman on the phone who informed me 
that the warrantee is/was 1 year.  He told me for repair that he 
would send it back to Germany but was not able to give me an 
estimate (which I can understand).  If it were to be covered I would 
need proof of purchase, good luck on a 25 year old lens!

The rep also said I should easily notice ploblems when the 
separation increases and starts to affect the image. 

Thanks to all that contributed

Stephen

Subject: how to check darkroom ventilation?
Sender: owner-pure-silver@tundraware.com

Reply-To: pure-silver@tundraware.com

For the second time in six months, I have been injured by a poorly
ventilated darkroom. The first time happened this summer, when I worked in
a darkroom at the Glassell school in Houston. I knew something was wrong
since I was having headaches and lung pain, as were other people, and I
kept asking about the ventilation.  Finally on the last day of the class,
the teacher showed me a switch behind some barrels which she said she
"thought" might be the vent fan switch!  To my knowledge this fan was not
on all summer, even though there are usually close to a hundred people
using that darkroom.  (I wrote a letter to the director of this school, and
he wrote me back a week or so later saying that the problem had been
corrected by wiring the vent fan into the general lighting system for the
whole building, so that when the lights are turned on in the building in
the morning, the vent fan comes on also.  Also the open buckets of used fix
have been covered.)

I got better after a month away from darkrooms, but this month I started
feeling bad again working in a different darkroom, this time at the
University of Houston. This darkroom has been recently built in a renovated
building.  The contractors got a lot of stuff wrong--for instance they
reversed the hot and cold water taps--and we just discovered yesterday that
the switch we thought turned on the vent fans in the darkroom actually
doesn't.   The real switch is in another room!  Therefore we had often been
working without any ventilation, for several months.  The little 4x5
processing room also is apparently not hooked up to the fans, even though a
vent duct appears to be there.  (Also there is no fresh air intake for that
room.)

I went to a doctor yesterday and he told me I had chemical burns in my
lungs and to stay out of darkrooms for several months.

My question is:  is there anyway to ascertain, when working in a darkroom,
whether it is adequately ventilated?  Apparently merely asking the people
who run it is not enough.  Is there a way I can check, short of buying an
engineer's flow meter?  Maybe that would be a good investment...I am
getting pretty nervous about this, having been made ill several times.

shannon- actually I am shocked by your story especially in a public 
school/facility. I just went through this with my home darkroom and the heat 
and ac guys make it very complicated.  I will give you some simple 
suggestions then explain the HVAC thing as I understand it.
>
I think that you have learned the hard way to not assume that the 
school/public darkroom has safe ventilation. Ask the teacher to explain to 
you where/how the ventilation works; where the switch is etc.  Then go to 
the vent and feel if there is intake (light a match in front of the vent and 
see if it goes out). Also ask where the intake (fresh air) is coming from.  
If the so-called fresh air is coming from another smelly room then it is not 
fresh air.  The bean counters at the Houston schools are not dumb.  Good 
ventilation means a waste of good air conditioning in summer months.  Sue 
them and they will fix it.
>
You can understand ventilation by comparing it to washing a print.  A print 
is achivally washed when it has xx changes of water.  That is: the time it 
takes for the washer to fill with water then drain that same amount 
mutiplied by xx( your standard for archival)  With an achival washer you can 
use food coloring to measure water exchange.  This is harder with air 
exchange.  There is a scientific formula that is beyond the scope of this 
note.  Basically the HVAC folks first look at the cubic feet (size) of the 
room.  Then they calculate the intake.  Based on these numbers they then buy 
an exhaust fan measured in units .  My fan is 300 GPH (something per hour) 
and clears a 10x16" by 7feet tall darkroom very nicely. >
>
There is a great article in the 1997 issue of Photo Techniques (JAN/Feb. 
issue) called "the Well Ventilated Darkroom".  This same idea of ventilation 
is what they use at International Center of Photography darkrooms here in 
New York
>
hope this helps

Shannon,  It does not surprise me at all.  Ventilation systems can be
complicated as Richard has some what explained.  There are many issues to cover
when you start to look at exhaust systems and "fresh" air.  I would suggest
requesting a WR Grainger catalog.  Not only does it have lots of neat stuff in
it, it also has a good explanation of air exchange rates and how to calculate
them.  I would suggest using a smoking (recently extinguished)  match rather
than a lit match.

Ask if a regular inspection of dampers and such has been established.  Dampers
control air flow and can become jammed; open or shut.  Ventilation for one room
can be quite simple.  But ventilation of several rooms  can be quite
complicated.

If you can smell fixer it should be a tip off. The  ventilation is not
adequate.  Another aspect to look at is spillage.  When spills occur in large
communal darkrooms, it is very important to make sure the mess is cleaned up.
Not only will spills cause an immediate problem, but they can also cause
delayed problems.

Heat and humidity can be real problems.

A good darkroom has these problems fixed before students are placed in harms
way.  Get OSHA or the faculty to provide you with a test of air quality.  Every
one will be better off for it.

The quick rough testing method I use for my home darkroom etc. is 
to use a stick of incense.  You get visible indication of the air 
currents and smell test.  Of course your sense of smell does 
saturate to the incense smell so you have to leave for a while and 
go back to see if the smell has really cleared.  

Incense is so much more pleasant than the sulphur sticks that 
are/were used to find exhaust leaks in furnaces etc.  Obviously you 
wouldn't use the burning sulphur test for a darkroom.

Have to unlurk myself here. 

I too was recently given some FP4+ (35mm) and had good results with Rodinal
1:50 at Agfa's recommended time (don't have that in front of me but I
believe it's 18 min.). Contrast was a little higher than I'd like for normal
contrast with my D2V condenser enlarger but this was offset by overcast
lighting and the negatives printed very well. 

I rated the film at ISO 80. For more normal contrast and a condenser
enlarger, I'll cut developing time 20 percent or so for future rolls. I'd
say the agfa time gave me approximately N+1.

I normally shoot large format HP5 and will be using a 645 camera for some

Any thoughts on the differences/similarities?
 If I use 125 as my EI for the HP5 would a similar -stop and a half or so-
drop in EI give me a similar density with the FP4+?
 I don't have time to run test so any help would be great!

As we are talking about two different film sizes here I also need to unlurk.

FP4+ 35mm and FP4+ 120 and sheet films are not the same emulsion, so be
careful.


For 35mm FP4+ rated at 125 Ilford suggests 8-1/2 minutes in Rodinal 1:50 at
68f/20c.

For sheet film and 120 rated at 125, 15 minutes at 68F/20c.

Other times with other developers very according.  For D76 straight it is
5-1/2 minutes for 35, 8 minutes for sheet and 120, etc.

Thanks to all for the help!
Lenses are polished and I'm about off......on the trip ...but probably a
little bit mentally also :o)
 I decided to carry the 8x10 also so will have some "backup" to the 645.
:o)
I shoot Tmax 100 at 50 EI so think that I'll just use the same for the FP4+
since everyone seems to think it is somewhere around 80 EI or lower. I do
need to keep detail in the dark water as much as possible. I will run
development test for the contrast when I get back.
Thanks again for all the advice.....now does anyone know how to keep the
snakes off my tripod....:o)

Hi, John ...

Good point. I wasn't aware of different emulsions for different film sizes
but I've found that to be the case with some Kodak stuff. Eighteen minutes
seemed long to me. I got that figure off the Agfa web site but I may have
been reading the wrong part of the data sheets. 

The time I actually used was whatever was on the Rodinal bottle but I didn't
have one here to check.

As we are talking about two different film sizes here I also need to unlurk.

FP4+ 35mm and FP4+ 120 and sheet films are not the same emulsion, so be
careful.


For 35mm FP4+ rated at 125 Ilford suggests 8-1/2 minutes in Rodinal 1:50 at
68f/20c.

For sheet film and 120 rated at 125, 15 minutes at 68F/20c.

Other times with other developers very according.  For D76 straight it is
5-1/2 minutes for 35, 8 minutes for sheet and 120, etc.

Hello,
Well, the title says it all... I'm trying to find an 'affordable' source of
imported Neopan for Quickload in the U.S. It is not imported by Fuji, but
surely more than one outfit as some grey available.
Thanks.

Thanks for this tip.  I'll save it for future reference.  The most recent
time I got sick, though, I was processing 4x5 film in a little room, and I
was using plain water for stop.  I later found out that this little room
had no ventilation at all, even though there appeared to be a vent duct in
the ceiling.  I was in there a long time, as I processed 24 sheets, six at
a time. I think it was the fumes from the fix. I read that fix gives off
sulfur dioxide, which can burn your lungs.

Anyway, for the next few months I am going to be processing and printing
color only, as we have a machine that does the actual chemical baths for
you inside the machine.  Our university is looking into the ventilation
problems in the darkrooms. An engineer is supposed to come out and measure
the flow through the ducts in the black and white darkroom soon.

One of my teachers suggested trying to print some of my black and white
negatives on the color machine, which I am going to try.  Has anyone else
on this list tried this?  I saw some prints this past summer at the John
Cleary gallery in Houston, by David Fokos, that were printed on color
paper; also an exhibit of Bill Jacobson's work, some of which was on color
paper.  My teacher told me that the separation in the middle tones would
not be as good, but you would only notice that if you compared a black and
white print processed traditionally side by side with the same picture done
on color paper.  I would be interested in people's opinions about this.

  Ilford stop bath is also citric acid. 

A caution: Citric acid stop baths should not be used with hardening fixers.
Citric acid is a sequestering agent for aluminum. It will interfere with
the operation of the hardener by binding the aluminum sulfate. It is
reported that this can also cause sludging of the fixing bath. 
  Ilford does not make a hardening fixing bath. 
  All of Kodak's fixers are hardening, however, the hardener for Kodak
Rapid Fixer is in a separate container and can be left out. 
  I believer all of Agfa's fixers are hardening.

  Another alternative to Acetic acid is Sodium Bisulfite or Potassium
Metabisulfite. A general purpose stop bath is:

Kodak SB-6
Sodium bisulfite or
Potassium metabisulfite				30.0 grams
Water to make 					 1.0 liter

All

Silly question I know but how do peeps get rid of birds in landscape
shots?  When Sylvia and I were at Mono Lake earlier this year this was a
real problem.  We tried reasoning, shouting and clapping hands but all
to no avail.  We thought about a portable marine fog horn, one of those
rotary 'clapper things' we used to have as children (do they still use
the at socker matches and where can you buy them in the US?) or a
shotgun.  Any ideas chaps?

Malcom,

A neighbour, a few doors down, has a rather large plastic owl on top of
pole that she uses to discourage non-insectivorous birds from "attacking"
her  rather large strawberry patch...  she claims that it also discourages
a significant percentage of other species... with the exception of a
kestrel that seems to take pleasure in sitting on top of the plastic owl
awaiting in-between-meal snacks.... My wife claims he is like most
males.... he does not seem to be able to "get the message"......  8-)

I believe these scare-owls are available at places like Home Depot.

Ken

I found the slap of the shutter on my Yashica 35mm camera will scare off 
birds for about 1/8 mile.  Makes people around me a bit jumpy too.

I changed cameras.

Why rid yourself of birds at Mono Lake?  They may be asking themselves how
to rid the lake of humans.

One of Mono Lake's functions is a bird sanctuary.  I'd vote that you
shouldn't be trying to get rid of them.

Does anyone have a good source for parts for a Visitor flash?  In particular,
I need a PhotoFlash rated electolytic capacitor rated at 400 microfarads at
350V (marked CE62, but I doubt that matters).  I would prefer actual
Vivitar replacement part, but I cannot seem to find a source.

TIA,

The wall behind my sink is plain old sheet rock.  I'd like to paint it to
ensure the sheet rock doesn't rot from water splashing against it now and
then.

Can anyone recommend a water proof or water resistant paint or other such
substance?

tia.

Epoxy paint is what most folks use.  It is a two part paint that you mix 
just prior to painting.  I just bought some and it was only available (at my 
local paint store) in gallons and the price was around $50.00  It is very 
smelly and will kill a few brain cells.
>
I tried something behind my sink that was not epoxy paint.  It has not had 
the "test of time" (just painted it last week) but I am hopeful. There is an 
enamel paint that is used for concrete floors, like what people use to paint 
there garage floors etc.  It will yellow I am told , but it is hard as a 
rock.  I used a oil base primer then put one coat of the concrete paint on.  
These are the only options that I know of, but I am sure there are others

    Try Wasatch Photo supply on Federal Blvd about a block north of 
the 6th Ave Freeway (US 6) on the west side of the street.  (I have 
no connection with them save as a very happy customer during my 10 
years in Denver)

And isn't that the whole reason to have a darkroom?  Guess it's a good thing
this followed the darkroom circulation thread...

I glued a sheet of Formica to the wall behind the sink.

You could hang an additional sheet of green board up first or even replace your
existing drywall with it.  It is required in bath rooms and rooms of high
humidity.  This goes along with the ventilation issue, but you should be sure that
if you have room that is being converted to a darkroom that you consider what
extra humidity might mean to the walls, outlets etc.. and make sure that you
adequately vent the room.

Have fun

malcolm and sylvia,

to me, your question of how to get rid of birds at mono lake troubles me 
greatly.  mono lake is meant to be a bird sanctuary.  many rare species of 
birds come to mono lake at various times of the year.  you must realize that 
photographing nature means you have to plan around it, not the other way 
around.  if you don't want birds in your pictures of mono lake, you need to 
do some research and go to mono lake during times of the year that birds do 
not frequent it.  there is a reason why it is hard to get excellent landscape 
photographs, that is because nature is going to do what it does naturally, 
and we are the ones that have to change and conform to it.  your additude of 
wanting the birds to go away so you can take your pictures, seems to be one 
of, ''o.k. i'm here.  it's time for nature to arrange itself for me.''  
nature just dosen't work that way.

I'm not sure what sheet rock is but suspect that yatch varnish will do the
job.
It has worked on my marine ply made wet bench for over a decade now with an
extra layer painted on each year just as I go on my hols.(vacation) so no
time is lost due to drying.

regards

JR

Why don't you photograph the birds? They can add a lot to the landscape,
especially at Mono Lake

I recall seeing pictures of an amusement park taken in such light or with
such a slow film/tiny aperture that most of the people on the midway were
invisible because no matter how slowly they moved their images were not
recorded. Would this work with birds?

Actually we like birds and often visit a nature sanctuary seeing Blue
Herons, Brown Pelicans and Waders, etc.  We have nothing against birds! 
You have a good point about birds being able to add to a landscape but
it seems to me that this is dependent on what is wanted from the image. 
Yes, Mono Lake is a wonderful place where we vacationed this year.  My
concern however, is that birds can also distract from an image if you
don't want them.  I guess the birds were on vacation at the same time we
were but what's worse is they were sitting on the Tufas :-)

Actually I thought it was rather amusing that the birds at Mono Lake
ignored my request to do a quick test flight.

Regards
Malcolm

All

I promised to post the result of my investigation into a 100W regulated
switching PSU for my enlarger.  If interested read on or otherwise hit
delete now.  I have not yet implimeted this as for a quick fix pending
this response, I purchased a 110V/12V garden light transformer for $32.

The response from Meanwell who manufacture swithing PSUs is below. 
Meanwell PSUs are available in my local Frys Electronics.

Sorry for late respond, According to your questions as below that now I
would recommended you if your used our products of 150 watt it shall be
not problem for your application on halogen lamp, but I would
recommended you for below model for your reference. 

1. S-150-12 : if you used this product which it must cut off one
resistor to prevent when surge income to shut off power supply. This
model the price might be cheap so I listed this model only for pricing
consideration for you. 
2. SP-150-12: this model is very suitable for your application and it do
not need to modify any component but the pricing might be higher than
S-150-12. 
3. LPP-150-12: if you just considering would used open frame of PCB type
model which this model also is suitable choice for you, it do not need
to modify any component for your application, obviously the pricing is
cheap than S-150-12. 

These are all of information for your reference and consideration if you

This is a good suggestion. I have used Formica in this way without any

Very neat and durable, and no toxic smells:-)  You can also sqeegee fixed
prints on the splash back for veiwing prior to washing. Wash down after use.

Thanks, Eric, for answering this much more nicely than I could have brought 
myself to do . . . 'nuff said, I hope.

Instead of getting rid of what you perceive as unwanted (tho' I can't fathom 
why, as they're an integral part of any LANDSCAPE), how about the tactic 
used when "waiting for the light to change" (animals being an equally viable 
part of nature as is light, as well as equal in moral significance to 
photographers).

I wonder if anybody on this list is using a daylight tank to process 4x5
negatives. I have been using tanks and the dip-and-dunk method, but I have
been thinking of switching to a daylight tank.  My normal time in the open
tanks is six minutes. I think I should probably increase that time if I use
a daylight tank, but by how much?

Hi Shannon
I have been away photographing in VERY wet Scottish Highlands for the last
week, and am therefore sorry if this reply is a little late.
I use the Combi tank in preference to open try processing for 4x5. I did try
other daylight tanks with really terrible results. However, the Combi, with
its specially curved film holder gives very even results, and it is not
prone to the damage that the corners of sheets of film can cause in damaging
the emulsion of other sheets in the tray. The fact that it takes 6 sheets at
a time, and is economical with solutions also helps. (I have managed 12
sheets back-to-back when I had a huge number of sheets to process, but there
are particular challenges, i.e. problems, with this that need special
attention to be solved).
You would find that its inversion agitation gives times pretty well
identical times to open tray processing, and that predictable repeatable
results are easy. The main problem people highlight with the Combi is its
slow speed filling. This is true - it takes 35 seconds to fill completely.
However, it is not too much of a problem really. The concern is that there
may be uneven development from top to bottom of the sheets as the developer
enters through the lid but fills up from the bottom, then drains from the
base. This could mean that the bottom of the sheets got a minute, say, more
development than the top. The answer is at the end of development to invert
the tank and drain the solution through the port in the lid. That evens
things up totally. You just need to allow for the drain period in your over
all development time. This works fine in practice. Unevenness is not a
problem.
I recommend the Combi for DiXactol processing since the inversion agitation
is very effective without the problems or aerial oxidisation given by some
rotary processors with tanning and staining developers.
I have used film tubes too, and they worked OK, but handling 6 sheets at a
time with them requires considerable dexterity.

"The Combi-tank takes 1050ml developer etc. so when devving 12 sheets of
film
at a time this is only 87,5ml of dev. per sheet.
Isthis OK? Seems very low to me. Do you reduce the dilution to compensate
for this or is there no difference in practice?
Sounds like a whole lot of fun loading the film though!"

Depends on the developer John. I load twelve sheets simply back to back when
I really need to. They stick together, and the anti-halation backing isn't
removed. I peel them apart after the fixer and rinse them in water in a tray
which removes the backing dye. Alternatively, if the film rack is loaded
originally underwater (sounds a lot harder than it actually is) the sheets
don't stick together, and the dye is removed in normal processing. I hadn't
heard of the interleaving with mesh dodge. I'll have to give that a try.

I normally shoot large format HP5 and will be using a 645 camera for some
"swamp and hanging moss" subjects. I plan to use FP4 for the first time in
years to get better grain and sharpness for the smaller format{ I was given
a "brick" of the film to use! ...can't turn this down  :o) }.
Any thoughts on the differences/similarities?
 If I use 125 as my EI for the HP5 would a similar -stop and a half or so-
drop in EI give me a similar density with the FP4+?
 I don't have time to run test so any help would be great!

Chuck
When not working with DiXactol, which gives full manufacturer's rated film
speed, I normally rate HP5 Plus at EI 160 in dilute Perceptol 1:2, and FP4
at EI 64. My higher speeds probably don't take into account the extremely
contrasty lighting with which you work. I do come down to EI 80 occasionally
with HP5 under extreme conditions, but then I would work with my metol two
bath as shown on my web site (www.barrythornton.com). I feel FP4 is the
nearest thing to a slower HP5 that you can get (or maybe HP5 is a faster
FP4). I believe it to be the best of the conventional grain medium speed
films - though I am still playing with Verichrome Pan and getting nice
results.
Try Ilfosol S if you can get it over there in the US with FP4 - though not
with HP5 where it is a tad too grainy -  for the best sharpness of any
conventional developer with full-bodied graduation and acceptable grain.
Pity about the small pack size of the Ilfosol though.

Barry,
Isn't the small pack size of Ilfosol because it has a pretty limited shelf

I've never had a problem with the anti-halation not being removed, and until
recently I always used Tmax which is notorious for leaving pink stuff unless
fixed double the time.  Believe me, the screening/mesh jobby works like a
charm.  That is, as long as, of course, you make sure the film is emulsion
side out :).

I have to do a photo journalistic style wedding shoot in a couple weeks, and
have thought that I will use Ilford Delta 3200, rated at 1000, developed in
pyro.  Question 1) Am I crazy to shoot it all in Delta 3200? 2) what
developing time would I use for pyro?  3200 is not listed in Hutchings' book
3) should I rate it other than 1000?
Thanx!  Chris (PS there is a traditional wedding photographer shooting color
film there, too and doing all the typical shots that need to be taken, so my
butt is not completely on the line)

  The pink or violet or puce stuff left on T-Max is sensitizing dye. It is
completely removed by a wash aid. 
  Anti halation dye is contained in the anti-curl gelatin backcoating of
most film B&W film. It is not removed but rather decolorized by both the
developer and the fixer. The developer will usually decolorize it in a
minute. This is probably an Azo dye which is converted to the leuco form by
the alkali in the fixer. 
  While T-Max fixes more slowly than most other films the presense of the
sensitizing dye does not necessarily mean that there is halide left in the
emulsion. The presense of halide can be tested by using a sulfide or
Selenium toner test. For Selenium use Kodak Rapid Selenium Toner, diluted
1:9. For sulfide make up a 1% solution of Sodium Sulfide. Either will stain
halide. Put a drop or two on the film and allow to stay for three minutes,
then blot off. Fully fixed film or paper will show no sign of stain. 
  BTW, one of the phenomena accompianing the decomposition of old safety
base film (known as "vinegar syndrome in the motion picture industry) is
the recoloring of anti-halation dyes causing serious staining of old
negatives. 
  This has become a serious problem since the acetate base used in films
made from the 1920's through the 1960's have begun to show this problem.
Some brands are worse than others. Nearly every negative on Defender film
from the 30's through the 50's on acetate base is affected.

Just did something similar last weekend:  shot four rolls of candids at a 
wedding using Kodak's TMZ, which they rate at 3200.  I originally set my 
meter for 1600, thinking I could give N-1 development (in Xtol) and found 
the venue (I love that word) REALLY dark.  Ended up exposing at 3200for 
three rolls under "natural" light.  After developing one roll normally I 
saw that these would be really thin negs.  Gave the other 3 rolls N+1 
development (Xtol 1:1).  About half the frames still have clear holes where 
eyes should be.

Also used a flash on one roll (if you do this, you really should mark 
it!!).  In the same soup this roll came out considerably denser 
(surprise  :-).  Haven't printed (or contacted) any of them, but the flash 
frames look printable.  With 3200 film, you don't need as much fill as I used.

Since this was not for profit, I didn't test in advance.  If you can get 
into the site ahead of time and have them set the lights as they will be, 
do a test roll.  Maybe shoot the rehearsal and develop the same night.

First consider the lighting. You may not need a 3200 film.  I just shot
candids and used FP4+ pushed to 200 in rodinal 1:50, and negatives are
beautiful, and blow to 11x14 without excess grain.

The lighting was normal indoor lighting, a tad on the bright side.

If possible, I would check out the location in advance.

Cheers,

John

I've used it for about five years and like it fine. I don't know that
there's too much that can be said about a timer except that it works. I use
it in conjunction with the Aristo VCL 4500 head, so that the actual time
varies with the light output of the head (the more blue that is used, the
more contrast and the more light). However, I assume it could just be used
as a "normal" timer, though it would be fairly expensive if used only that
way. If you have any specific questions, let me know by e mail and I'll try
to answer them.

I have both the Metrolux I and II. These are very good timers, designed
especially for cold light. With the use of a probe the timer varies seconds
to compensate for actual light output. Calibration is straightforward,
installation of the probe (on an Aristo 4x5 head) fairly easy. I no longer
use cold light but still use the Metrolux because I prefer its
straightforward display, simple up/down time buttons, time calibrated in
10ths of a second, adjustable display brightness, and clearly audible
metronome beep. Any specific questions?

Of course we all have different combinations and formulas that work for us.
Eventually we find one that we like.  Delta 3200 has become one of my most
dependable films.  The combination of Delta 3200 and Xtol has been magic for
me.  I particularly like it in 120 format.  I expose it at ISO 1200 and use
1:1 dilution in Xtol.  It allows me to hand hold my camera with long lenses
and use the Contax 645 much the same way that I would use a 35mm.  I find it
looks much like Delta 400 at this speed.

This would exactly corroborate with the info on Delta that I have;
apparently, it really has an ISO of 800-1000, up to 1250-1600 if developed
in Microphen.  Therefore, if you were shooting it at 3200 you'd have to push
it dev wise 2 stops, correct?.  I cannot find, in the lit on the film box or
in the tech sheet from Kodak on Xtol, what the dev times are in Xtol.  I
would also develop it 1:1, so if you have the exact times for Xtol at 1:1
exposing the film at  800, 1600, and 3200 could you let me know?  Also, was
your grain huge, or OK?>  OH YEAH, I'll try to find that massive development
chart on the web and see if it says there.

Ok, so here's what I found on the massive dev chart:

http://www.digitaltruth.com/
At 20 degrees C:
Xtol  400      5
Xtol  800      6
Xtol 1600     6.5
Xtol 3200    7.5
Xtol 6400  10
Xtol12500 12.5
Xtol (1+1)1600   15 (24C)
Xtol (1+2)1600   17 (24C)
Xtol (1+2)3200   20 (24C)
Shoulda checked the chart before I asked the question to the pure silver
group!
Chris

I use 35mm Delta 3200 at almost all the weddings (10-15 a year)I shoot 
with beautiful results.
I rate it at 1600 and develop it in Microphen 70 degrees 8 minutes.
I have not got it to work well in Pyro, which I use on my Delta 100 and 
400 negatives also with beautiful results.
some of which you might find on my website

If you must use a fast film, use Neopan 1600 and develop in Rodinol.

Shannon,
It may be worth checking you're not reacting to stop baths. I can't work
with an acetic acid stop bath, though citric acid is fine. Tetenal make a
